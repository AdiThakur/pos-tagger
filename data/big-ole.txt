Detective
Chief
Inspector
John
McLeish
gazed
doubtfully
at
the
plate
before
him
.
Having
thought
he
was
hungry
,
he
now
realized
that
actually
he
needed
anything
rather
than
the
overflowing
plate
of
cholesterol
the
canteen
at
New
Scotland
Yard
had
provided
with
such
admirable
promptness
.
Sleep
would
perhaps
make
more
sense
after
thirty-six
hours
straight
on
duty
,
much
of
it
spent
with
a
sullen
Jamaican
who
had
killed
his
landlady
and
her
three
children
in
the
crowded
kitchen
of
a
house
behind
the
Westway
.
He
took
an
experimental
mouthful
of
fried
egg
and
waited
to
see
if
it
was
going
to
suit
him
,
then
progressed
to
the
baked
beans
,
cautiously
.
He
finished
the
egg
,
all
the
baked
beans
and
one
of
the
sausages
,
but
decided
the
fried
bread
was
tempting
fate
and
pushed
the
plate
aside
,
reaching
for
his
cup
of
tea
,
resting
both
elbows
on
the
table
.
He
lifted
a
hand
off
his
cup
in
weary
salute
to
one
of
his
sergeants.
a
very
dark
Scot
in
a
crumpled
grey
suit
who
was
walking
over
from
the
counter
,
and
the
man
altered
course
to
sit
opposite
him
.
"
How
goes
it
,
Bruce
?
"
Bruce
Davidson
had
accompanied
McLeish
from
his
last
posting
to
C1
,
that
division
of
New
Scotland
Yard
concerned
exclusively
with
murder
,
and
they
had
now
worked
together
for
four
years
in
the
CID
.
"
Got
that
Tottenham
case
weighed
off
,
nae
bother
.
I
hear
you
've
finished
the
Westway
job
.
Ye
need
to
get
your
head
down
,
John
,
you
're
looking
rough
.
"
McLeish
nodded
.
He
had
glanced
in
the
washroom
mirror
and
it
had
not
been
a
reassuring
sight
.
A
big
man
,
six
foot
four
inches
in
his
socks
and
a
good
fourteen
stone
,
he
always
looked
mildly
untidy
,
and
this
morning
,
having
worn
the
same
clothes
for
a
day
and
a
half
he
looked
like
a
football
supporter
after
a
night
in
the
cells
.
At
thirty-two
,
he
was
young
enough
not
to
look
completely
haggard
,
even
after
thirty-six
hours
with
only
the
odd
hour
's
sleep
,
but
his
dark
hair
was
plastered
to
his
head
and
the
brown
eyes
were
sunk
back
in
his
head
and
reddened
with
smoke
and
exhaustion
.
"
I
'm
going
off
.
You
too
?
"
"
I
'm
waiting
for
Catherine
-
Sergeant
Crane
.
"
Even
falling
asleep
as
he
was
,
McLeish
was
amused
at
Bruce
Davidson
's
hopeful
,
proprietorial
air
.
Catherine
Crane
had
joined
the
division
three
months
ago
,
creating
a
major
upheaval
.
She
was
a
slight
young
woman
of
twenty-seven
,
whose
dazzling
,
delicate
,
blond
looks
concealed
a
ferocious
intelligence
and
attack
.
Every
man
in
her
vicinity
had
found
himself
putting
his
best
foot
forward
,
and
she
had
done
wonders
for
the
sartorial
standards
of
the
notoriously
uncaring
C1
division
.
McLeish
himself
,
though
admiring
,
had
been
unaffected
;
he
had
been
in
love
for
over
a
year
with
a
young
woman
only
a
little
older
,
and
even
cleverer
,
than
Sergeant
Crane
.
His
Francesca
was
a
rising
star
in
the
Department
of
Trade
and
Industry
,
and
they
planned
to
celebrate
her
thirtieth
birthday
with
a
skiing
holiday
,
due
to
start
in
two
weeks
'
time
.
He
smiled
on
Davidson
,
cheered
immeasurably
by
the
thought
of
getting
on
a
plane
with
Francesca
.
After
chatting
to
Davidson
for
a
few
minutes
longer
,
he
went
back
to
his
office
.
looking
for
his
secretary
,
a
plumpish
,
infinitely
competent
,
middle-aged
mother
of
three
.
She
was
on
the
phone
and
he
stood
silently
,
filling
the
doorway
,
raising
an
eyebrow
at
her
.
She
motioned
him
to
stay
.
"
It
's
Francesca
,
John
.
"
"
Thanks
,
Jenny
.
I
'll
take
it
back
there
,
"
he
said
,
brightening
,
and
she
watched
,
with
a
little
jealousy
.
as
he
hurried
back
to
his
desk
.
"
Darling
.
I
've
got
a
horrendous
problem
.
Can
you
possibly
duck
out
and
have
coffee
in
the
caff
in
ten
minutes
?
"
The
voice
at
the
other
end
was
slightly
husky
but
very
clear
.
"
It
's
Tristram
.
He
's
been
arrested
in
New
York
.
Better
not
talk
on
the
phone
,
had
we
?
"
"
Oh
,
Christ
.
No
.
I
'll
meet
you
.
"
He
put
down
the
phone
,
rattled
.
With
his
much-loved
Francesca
came
her
four
younger
brothers
for
whom
,
as
the
eldest
child
of
a
widow
,
she
had
always
considered
herself
responsible
.
All
four
were
talented
musicians
and
difficult
people
,
in
varying
degrees
;
Tristram
.
one
of
the
twenty-four-year-old
twins
,
had
proved
the
most
difficult
,
perhaps
because
he
was
not
the
most
talented
.
McLeish
gritted
his
teeth
,
and
,
trying
not
to
consider
the
implications
of
what
he
had
been
told
.
made
one
quick
phone
call
,
then
took
the
lift
down
and
walked
across
the
road
from
New
Scotland
Yard
to
the
little
cafe
which
was
,
as
usual
,
full
of
workmen
engaged
in
rebuilding
the
offices
in
the
area
.
Stopping
to
buy
a
paper
,
he
caught
sight
of
Francesca
through
the
window
,
perched
on
one
of
the
bar
stools
,
totally
unconscious
of
the
table
full
of
men
next
to
her
all
eyeing
her
long
legs
.
He
stood
and
watched
her
,
putting
off
the
moment
when
.
as
he
half
knew
,
he
would
be
asked
to
acquiesce
in
some
lunatic
scheme
for
pulling
Tristram
out
of
trouble
,
and
saw
her
for
a
moment
from
a
position
of
detachment
:
a
tall
young
woman
looking
younger
than
her
twenty-nine
years
.
dark
,
with
a
long
straight
nose
and
arched
eyebrows
.
She
was
looking
particularly
uncompromising
today
,
tired
and
pale
,
her
dark
,
short
hair
spiking
up
at
the
back
.
She
had
been
crying
,
McLeish
observed
resignedly
,
as
he
pushed
through
the
door
.
"
All
right
,
tell
me
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
sat
down
heavily
beside
her
,
and
got
a
careful
,
measuring
.
sidelong
look
.
"
I
have
to
go
to
New
York
in
a
hurry
and
bail
Tristram
out
.
He
was
arrested
last
night
,
with
one
of
the
backing
group
and
three
of
the
band
.
They
're
all
in
the
nick
.
charged
with
possession
.
Cocaine
,
as
I
understand
it
.
"
"
Jesus
.
"
"
I
know
,
I
know
,
just
when
he
was
beginning
to
be
a
success
like
Perry
.
It
simply
went
to
his
head
-
you
know
what
he
was
like
when
he
left
.
"
"
Thought
he
could
walk
on
water
,
"
McLeish
said
,
in
irritated
memory
.
"
Frannie
,
why
do
you
have
to
go
?
He
has
a
manager
and
a
studio
,
does
n't
he
?
What
can
you
do
that
they
ca
n't
?
"
She
sighed
so
heavily
that
her
whole
ribcage
moved
.
"
I
am
to
some
extent
on
home
ground
there
,
"
she
said
,
reluctantly
and
not
looking
at
him
.
"
Mike
-
Michael
O'Brien
-
will
help
,
but
I
need
to
be
on
the
spot
.
"
McLeish
held
on
to
his
temper
,
reminding
himself
that
he
was
very
tired
.
Francesca
's
much
publicized
affair
with
Senator
Michael
O'Brien
was
the
reason
that
she
had
been
sent
home
rather
early
from
a
tour
of
duty
in
the
Embassy
in
Washington
,
over
a
year
previously
,
just
before
he
had
met
her
in
London
.
As
one
of
Francesca
's
DTI
colleagues
had
maliciously
observed
,
it
had
been
felt
that
fraternization
with
the
American
colleagues
could
be
carried
too
far
.
Francesca
herself
had
characteristically
taken
the
line
that
the
Foreign
Office
ought
to
have
been
glad
that
someone
on
the
staff
was
that
closely
involved
with
the
American
political
Establishment
.
"
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
O'Brien
?
"
"
Well
,
I
'm
hardly
going
to
get
back
into
bed
with
him
after
more
than
a
whole
year
.
There
'll
certainly
be
another
incumbent
by
now
.
But
he
is
the
senior
Senator
.
we
were
close
when
I
was
in
Washington
,
and
whichever
way
you
slice
it
he
wo
n't
want
my
brother
being
buggered
or
beaten
up
in
a
New
York
jail
.
"
Her
classically
good
diction
always
became
even
clearer
under
stress
,
so
that
this
statement
emerged
with
the
slightly
metallic
clarity
of
a
dubbed
film
,
and
the
clientele
of
the
small
cafe
was
obviously
appreciating
every
moment
.
McLeish
decided
that
since
she
was
unaware
of
her
audience
it
did
not
become
him
to
be
selfconscious
,
and
asked
what
she
expected
even
a
Senator
to
achieve
in
these
circumstances
?
"
Oh
.
darling
.
The
American
legal
system
is
so
odd
that
I
've
been
told
I
could
get
Tristram
deported
in
my
custody
.
It
's
a
disaster
,
of
course
it
"
s
a
disaster
,
he
'll
be
banned
from
the
US
for
ever
presumably
;
but
at
least
he
wo
n't
be
being
interfered
with
in
some
unspeakable
foreign
nick
.
"
"
I
thought
he
was
off
drugs
?
"
"
Well
we
all
hoped
,
did
n't
we
?
But
evidently
he
is
n't
,
and
I
must
get
him
back
.
"
McLeish
found
himself
on
the
verge
of
suggesting
that
a
thoroughly
unpleasant
time
in
a
New
York
jail
might
succeed
in
curing
Tristram
where
all
other
methods
,
including
exhortation
,
loving
family
support
and
a
spell
in
a
comfortable
private
hospital
in
Devon
,
had
failed
.
He
looked
at
his
love
's
shuttered
,
miserable
face
and
realized
he
would
get
nowhere
along
those
lines
.
"
Why
ca
n't
your
Mum
or
one
of
the
boys
go
?
"
"
Mum
is
in
bed
with
bronchitis
,
as
you
would
know
if
you
had
managed
to
get
out
of
that
place
since
last
Friday
.
"
Francesca
,
a
true
eldest
child
,
knew
how
to
score
her
points
.
"
Charlie
's
baby
is
due
tomorrow
,
Perry
is
in
Japan
on
tour
,
just
like
all
the
papers
say
.
Jeremy
is
coming
with
me
but
he
is
too
young
to
do
this
alone
,
and
in
any
case
I
'm
the
only
one
who
can
deploy
O'Brien
.
"
"
How
is
the
DTI
receiving
all
this
?
You
've
got
four
rescue
cases
.
"
Francesca
sighed
.
"
They
are
as
fed
up
with
me
as
you
are
,
but
they
wo
n't
stop
me
taking
leave
.
"
She
stopped
sharply
,
and
blushed
scarlet
.
"
Wait
a
minute
.
"
John
McLeish
felt
his
blood-pressure
going
up
.
"
What
about
skiing
,
if
you
're
using
leave
?
"
She
looked
at
him
,
wretchedly
.
"
I
have
to
go
.
I
really
expect
to
get
back
in
three
or
four
days
and
I
will
try
and
hang
on
to
the
holiday
.
I
know
we
need
it
,
it
seems
ages
since
we
went
to
bed
.
"
McLeish
scowled
round
the
fascinated
audience
,
returning
the
customers
to
their
egg
and
chips
.
"
Anyway
,
it
's
been
you
who
have
been
too
busy
for
months
.
"
McLeish
was
too
honest
not
to
acknowledge
the
point
.
"
The
more
important
,
then
,
for
us
to
have
a
holiday
together
.
"
"
I
know
.
Darling
,
I
am
sorry
,
I
really
expect
to
be
back
inside
the
week
,
and
I
would
n't
go
if
anyone
else
could
.
I
am
trying
-
I
mean
I
know
I
let
the
boys
lean
too
much
.
"
He
looked
at
her
,
defeated
,
and
she
saw
that
she
had
carried
the
point
,
but
at
a
heavy
cost
.
"
Do
you
still
love
me
?
"
she
asked
anxiously
.
"
Not
at
the
moment
.
"
An
indrawn
breath
from
the
spectators
unsettled
both
of
them
for
a
moment
.
Francesca
nearly
laughed
,
but
McLeish
's
expression
sobered
her
.
"
Let's
get
out
of
here
.
"
She
slid
obediently
off
the
bar
stool
,
bidding
a
civil
good-morning
to
the
cafe
owner
who
looked
,
McLeish
observed
,
as
if
he
would
willingly
have
swept
her
into
his
plump
Italian
embrace
,
and
they
walked
together
to
the
gates
of
New
Scotland
Yard
.
"
I
'll
ring
you
when
I
get
to
New
York
.
"
She
looked
,
worried
,
at
his
profile
.
"
You
're
furious
with
me
.
I
'm
sorry
.
I
love
you
.
"
"
I
do
n't
think
we
can
go
on
like
this
.
"
McLeish
surprised
himself
as
well
as
her
.
"
John
.
"
It
was
an
appeal
and
he
was
not
proof
against
it
.
He
bent
and
kissed
her
.
"
I
am
furious
,
and
I
want
you
back
quickly
.
But
good
luck
with
it
-
ring
me
if
you
need
help
.
"
The
look
she
flicked
him
reminded
him
that
this
was
one
area
where
she
would
not
appeal
for
his
help
;
she
had
been
more
than
careful
to
protect
him
from
any
involvement
with
a
drug-taking
brother
.
It
was
one
of
her
many
advantages
that
as
a
professional
civil
servant
herself
she
understood
the
constraints
of
his
career
.
She
turned
to
go
,
head
down
.
McLeish
saw
that
she
was
crying
again
,
but
decided
coldly
there
was
nothing
he
was
going
to
do
and
trudged
wearily
back
to
the
lift
,
the
morning
's
cheerfulness
totally
evaporated
.
"
I
'm
so
sorry
,
Miss
Morgan
is
n't
in
today
.
Would
you
like
to
speak
to
her
assistant
?
"
The
receptionist
,
like
everything
else
in
the
glass-walled
hall
,
was
immaculately
clean
,
glossy
,
highly
fashionable
and
faintly
reminiscent
of
an
Italian
restaurant
.
The
young
woman
in
the
plain
suit
was
not
intimidated
by
it
,
nor
by
the
hand-carved
plate
that
proclaimed
her
to
be
in
the
offices
of
Yeo
,
Davis
and
Partners
.
"
But
I
'm
having
lunch
with
her
,
"
she
said
.
"
It
was
arranged
some
time
ago
.
"
"
If
you
'll
just
wait
a
minute
,
I
'll
ask
someone
to
come
and
talk
to
you
.
"
The
immaculate
receptionist
's
manner
was
fraying
a
little
,
discomfort
with
the
situation
showing
like
the
edge
of
a
petticoat
.
She
looked
across
the
hall
and
visibly
relaxed
as
she
saw
a
man
moving
swiftly
down
the
staircase
.
"
Peter
!
"
The
man
altered
course
impatiently
to
deal
with
the
interruption
;
just
under
six
foot
,
he
looked
smaller
because
of
the
width
of
the
powerful
sloping
shoulders
which
even
good
tailoring
could
do
little
to
minimize
.
He
looked
sharply
at
the
receptionist
in
enquiry
,
suppressed
energy
in
his
every
movement
.
"
This
is
Miss
Huntley
who
was
supposed
to
be
having
lunch
with
Angela
today
.
"
The
tall
young
woman
blinked
as
the
man
turned
the
full
power
of
his
attention
on
her
.
"
Have
you
talked
to
Angela
this
week
?
"
She
stared
at
him
.
"
Well
,
no
,
"
she
said
,
"
but
there
was
no
need
-
I
mean
we
had
fixed
up
lunch
last
week
.
Is
she
not
here
?
"
"
No
.
No
she
is
n't
,
I
'm
afraid
.
I
'm
very
sorry
she
did
n't
let
you
know
.
"
He
was
clearly
preoccupied
but
Miss
Huntley
was
not
willing
to
let
him
go
.
"
You
're
her
boss
?
"
"
I
'm
the
senior
partner
,
yes
.
Peter
Yeo
.
"
She
had
his
attention
back
,
and
noticed
how
good-looking
he
was
with
those
bright
blue
eyes
and
brown
skin
against
the
black
hair
.
Rather
heavy
in
the
neck
,
but
an
attractive
man
.
He
looked
back
thoughtfully
at
her
,
taking
in
the
brown
eyes
,
the
long
,
none-too-clean
hair
,
and
the
patchy
make-up
through
which
broken
veins
in
the
cheeks
were
showing
.
Late
twenties
perhaps
,
but
did
n't
make
much
of
an
effort
.
"
So
how
do
I
get
hold
of
her
?
"
the
woman
enquired
,
fretfully
,
voice
rising
out
of
control
.
"
Perhaps
we
should
talk
somewhere
less
public
?
"
he
suggested
,
and
showed
her
hastily
into
his
office
.
"
What
has
happened
to
Angela
,
then
?
"
Miss
Huntley
asked
anxiously
,
and
he
decided
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
.
"
She
has
n't
been
in
at
all
this
week
.
"
"
And
it
is
now
Thursday
.
But
she
's
very
high
up
here
,
is
n't
she
?
"
He
blinked
.
"
She
's
a
partner
,
yes
.
"
"
You
must
have
talked
to
her
family
?
"
"
Well
,
I
waited
a
couple
of
days
.
Then
I
talked
to
everyone
.
Her
fiance
has
now
reported
her
as
a
missing
person
,
I
believe
.
"
"
Giles
Hawick
?
The
Minister
?
"
"
Yes
.
Sorry
-
but
were
you
-
are
you
close
to
her
?
"
"
My
uncle
used
to
employ
her
.
William
Coombes
.
I
do
know
her
quite
well
.
"
She
sounded
indignant
and
resentful
,
and
he
slowed
up
deliberately
.
"
Ah
.
I
have
heard
her
speak
of
him
.
"
"
Yes
.
He
died
two
years
ago
.
"
"
I
had
remembered
.
"
He
was
pouring
coffee
and
she
watched
his
thick
,
well-manicured
hands
.
"
I
need
to
see
her
.
"
Both
of
them
were
taken
aback
by
the
force
with
which
she
said
it
and
she
blushed
red
.
"
I
do
n't
know
where
she
is
!
"
he
admitted
,
reluctantly
.
"
I
was
disappointed
when
I
found
you
did
n't
either
.
Oh
,
darling
,
hello
,
do
come
in
.
"
Since
he
now
sounded
flustered
,
Penelope
Huntley
looked
with
interest
at
the
intruder
:
a
good-looking
,
slightly
overweight
woman
probably
in
her
early
forties
,
carefully
dressed
but
uncertain
.
"
Darling
,
this
is
Miss
Huntley
,
who
was
expecting
to
lunch
with
Angela
today
.
Miss
Huntley
,
my
wife
,
Claudia
Yeo
.
I
've
just
been
explaining
that
Angela
seems
to
have
gone
missing
.
"
"
I
think
everyone
is
probably
making
far
too
much
fuss
,
and
Angela
has
just
taken
off
for
a
few
days
'
holiday
.
"
Peter
Yeo
looked
momentarily
furiously
exasperated
.
"
Giles
Hawick
is
taking
it
seriously
enough
to
have
reported
her
as
a
missing
person
,
"
he
said
tightly
.
His
wife
gave
him
a
long
level
look
with
no
liking
in
it
at
all
,
and
Penelope
Huntley
watched
,
fascinated
.
"
Are
we
lunching
,
Peter
?
"
Peter
Yeo
jerked
into
action
.
"
Of
course
.
Look
,
Miss
Huntley
,
I
'm
afraid
we
are
rather
preoccupied
.
If
you
ring
us
tomorrow
we
may
know
more
.
I
'm
so
sorry
she
is
n't
here
.
"
Penelope
Huntley
,
who
would
very
much
have
liked
to
have
gone
on
with
the
discussion
,
found
herself
swept
out
of
the
office
,
and
walked
slowly
down
the
road
,
flushed
with
a
mixture
of
disappointment
and
excitement
.
In
New
Scotland
Yard
John
McLeish
was
trying
,
increasingly
irritably
,
to
clear
his
desk
so
he
could
go
home
.
Bruce
Davidson
was
making
a
meal
of
explaining
a
straightforward
case
essentially
because
he
was
trying
to
impress
Catherine
Crane
.
Not
that
he
was
succeeding
;
Sergeant
Crane
was
sitting
,
legs
crossed
,
only
just
not
fidgeting
,
as
Bruce
Davidson
wore
on
through
a
lot
of
unnecessary
detail
.
It
was
unprecedented
for
any
woman
to
have
that
effect
on
Davidson
,
whose
success
in
this
field
was
legendary
.
She
was
,
of
course
,
very
desirable
,
McLeish
conceded
:
reddish-blond
hair
above
blue
eyes
,
and
a
perfect
,
pale
skin
,
lightly
freckled
.
Her
apple-green
light
wool
suit
reminded
them
all
that
spring
would
one
day
come
.
Indeed
,
she
was
a
true
beauty
:
straight
,
fine
features
,
a
long
neck
,
a
gently
curved
,
slim
figure
.
He
found
himself
smiling
gently
as
he
sat
and
watched
her
,
and
pulled
himself
up
sharply
,
realizing
that
the
girl
was
annoyed
by
what
was
obviously
a
familiar
reaction
.
He
had
looked
at
her
papers
three
months
ago
,
when
the
posting
had
been
announced
,
and
had
noted
how
well
educated
she
was
.
She
had
joined
the
Met
with
three
A
levels
and
a
huge
number
of
O
levels
as
an
eighteen-year-old
,
then
worked
her
way
over
into
the
CID
,
and
was
now
a
Detective
Sergeant
and
ready
to
move
up
,
having
passed
the
exams
for
Inspector
.
His
phone
rang
and
he
picked
it
up
,
reluctantly
.
"
John
,
sorry
to
interrupt
.
Commander
Stevenson
wants
you
,
now
.
"
I
'll
come
.
Excuse
me
,
both
of
you
.
"
Catherine
and
Davidson
were
left
in
his
office
to
carry
on
the
conversation
,
and
while
Davidson
was
finding
her
some
more
coffee
,
Catherine
turned
the
photograph
on
John
McLeish
's
desk
to
look
at
it
.
"
Is
she
his
wife
?
"
"
No
,
no
,
that
's
Francesca
.
They
're
not
married
.
"
"
His
fiancee
?
"
"
No
.
No
,
I
do
n't
think
you
could
say
they
were
engaged
.
They
've
been
together
,
oh
,
for
over
a
year
.
"
Davidson
reviewed
this
explanation
.
"
They
do
n't
live
together
-
I
mean
not
in
the
same
place
,
"
he
added
conscientiously
.
"
She
was
married
before
.
"
"
What
about
him
?
McLeish
?
"
"
No
,
he
's
not
been
married
.
"
He
gazed
at
her
,
earnestly
.
"
Fancy
some
lunch
?
"
Catherine
Crane
smiled
back
.
"
Bit
early
for
me
.
"
Davidson
,
taken
aback
,
glanced
at
his
watch
.
Twenty
past
eleven
.
"
Bit
early
for
me
too
,
sorry
.
"
He
stopped
,
uncharacteristically
gravelled
,
got
a
quick
entirely
comradely
look
of
amusement
,
and
laughed
.
"
Come
on
,
let's
get
out
of
John
's
office
,
he
'll
likely
be
a
while
yet
.
"
John
McLeish
,
seated
at
the
other
side
of
a
table
from
Commander
Stevenson
,
would
have
agreed
with
this
judgement
.
Despite
the
urgency
of
the
summons
,
he
had
been
kept
waiting
in
Stevenson
's
outer
office
long
enough
to
read
the
early
edition
of
the
Evening
Standard
.
On
page
four
,
as
he
had
feared
,
was
a
bad
picture
of
Tristram
under
the
headline
"
Singing
star
on
US
Drugs
Charge
"
.
He
skimmed
the
accompanying
text
,
which
added
little
to
what
Francesca
had
already
told
him
,
filling
up
the
two
columns
with
a
recital
of
Tristram
's
career
beginning
with
his
legendary
recording
of
"
Panis
Angelicus
"
as
a
thirteen-year-old
treble
at
St
Joe
's
.
As
usual
,
much
was
made
of
the
fact
that
he
was
younger
brother
to
the
wildly
successful
Peregrine
,
now
in
Japan
on
tour
with
his
group
.
Indeed
McLeish
reflected
,
that
encapsulated
the
trouble
with
Tristram
-
everything
that
he
could
do
,
Perry
,
two
years
his
senior
,
could
apparently
do
just
that
bit
better
.
"
Come
in
John
.
Sit
down
.
"
Stevenson
,
a
quick-moving
,
stocky
northerner
with
a
distinguished
record
in
every
possible
branch
of
the
Met
,
was
rumoured
to
be
going
up
to
Assistant
Commissioner
just
as
soon
as
the
present
incumbent
retired
.
"
I
take
it
that
's
one
of
your
connections
in
bother
,
"
he
observed
,
seeing
the
paper
in
McLeish
's
hand
.
"
I
'm
afraid
so
.
Francesca
is
on
her
way
to
New
York
.
"
"
Why
?
"
"
That
's
what
I
asked
her
.
"
McLeish
hoped
he
was
not
sounding
as
defeated
as
he
felt
.
"
You
'll
need
to
be
very
careful
,
personally
,
in
dealing
with
an
addict
.
"
McLeish
sighed
.
"
They
know
that
.
Francesca
would
n't
have
him
in
the
house
when
she
knew
he
was
on
something
.
They
hoped
they
'd
got
him
detoxed
.
She
's
got
him
booked
in
again
at
Cocaine
Hall
when
she
gets
him
back
.
"
"
Will
she
manage
to
get
him
out
of
the
USA
?
"
Stevenson
sounded
startled
and
McLeish
said
,
wearily
,
that
Francesca
had
good
contacts
.
Everywhere
,
he
added
sourly
,
thinking
about
it
.
Stevenson
considered
him
thoughtfully
but
decided
there
was
little
profit
in
going
on
.
"
Not
why
I
called
you
in
.
We
've
got
another
one
to
look
at
.
Not
necessarily
for
us
yet
,
but
we
've
been
asked
by
Special
Branch
to
take
it
on
board
.
Missing
Person
.
"
McLeish
gazed
at
his
superior
.
Most
missing
person
reports
do
not
end
in
a
murder
.
Typically
they
are
husbands
or
wives
walking
out
to
live
somewhere
else
,
or
teenagers
leaving
home
.
He
kept
what
he
hoped
was
a
bright
and
intelligent
expression
on
his
face
and
waited
for
enlightenment
.
"
That
's
how
I
felt
,
"
Stevenson
agreed
.
"
The
problem
is
that
the
missing
person
was
going
to
marry
a
junior
Treasury
Minister
.
"
"
It
's
a
girl
,
then
.
"
McLeish
blinked
and
looked
apologetically
at
his
superior
.
"
How
long
have
you
been
on
duty
,
John
?
"
"
Thirty-six
hours
,
sir
.
Sorry
,
I
'll
wake
up
.
"
Stevenson
considered
him
.
"
You
'll
have
to
,
you
're
all
I
've
got
at
your
rank
.
Go
home
,
get
a
couple
of
hours
'
sleep
,
clean
up
and
get
back
here
.
You
're
seeing
Mr
Hawick
-
who
is
Financial
Secretary
to
the
Treasury
and
has
reported
his
fiancee
,
a
Miss
Angela
Morgan
,
as
missing
.
You
're
due
at
four-thirty
at
his
office
at
the
House
of
Commons
after
Treasury
Questions
,
whatever
they
are
.
I
'll
send
a
driver
for
you
.
"
"
Sir
.
"
McLeish
knew
what
Treasury
Questions
were
,
thanks
to
Francesca
.
Every
afternoon
in
the
House
of
Commons
MPs
could
raise
questions
with
Ministers
about
their
Departments
.
These
had
to
be
answered
,
and
answered
well
-
or
at
least
the
first
ten
or
so
did
-
because
the
original
questioner
and
other
MPs
were
allowed
to
ask
supplementary
questions
.
Once
you
got
down
to
Question
11
,
the
questioner
would
get
a
deeply
unhelpful
written
response
which
would
,
if
the
civil
servants
knew
their
business
,
leave
no
one
any
the
wiser
.
Endearingly
,
Francesca
herself
was
not
good
at
drafting
that
sort
of
answer
and
usually
had
to
enlist
a
more
senior
colleague
to
achieve
the
correct
polished
hand-off
.
And
he
knew
that
the
Financial
Secretary
was
the
junior
of
three
Treasury
Ministers
and
did
not
sit
in
the
Cabinet
.
"
Do
you
want
me
to
talk
to
Special
Branch
,
sir
?
"
"
I
've
done
that
.
Take
a
sergeant
with
you
,
assuming
there
is
such
a
thing
left
in
the
building
.
"
"
Yes
,
we
got
a
replacement
for
Jameson
-
what
?
-
three
months
ago
.
I
've
not
yet
worked
with
her
personally
,
sir
.
"
"
Ms
Crane
?
I
've
seen
her
.
"
Stevenson
's
clean-shaven
,
tight-mouthed
face
relaxed
in
a
ferocious
grin
.
"
Would
n't
mind
working
with
her
personally
,
myself
.
Yes
,
take
her
-
I
'll
check
with
Hawick
's
office
that
it
's
all
right
if
you
come
mob-handed
,
but
I
've
a
feeling
in
my
water
about
this
one
.
I
'd
like
to
have
a
proper
team
together
right
from
the
start
.
"
"
I
"
ll
tell
her
,
sir
.
"
"
Then
get
home
for
a
couple
of
hours
.
Best
suit
to
go
and
see
Mr
Hawick
.
"
John
McLeish
rose
to
go
but
was
recalled
as
he
reached
the
door
.
"
Anything
we
can
do
to
help
with
young
Wilson
?
I
could
ring
up
a
colleague
in
New
York
.
"
"
She
'd
rather
fix
it
herself
if
she
can
,
sir
,
I
do
know
that
.
But
thank
you
.
"
"
Better
for
us
to
be
involved
than
you
personally
,
John
.
"
"
I
know
that
,
sir
.
Thank
you
.
"
He
walked
into
the
corridor
,
tiredness
suddenly
overcoming
him
with
the
prospect
of
a
few
hours
off
,
and
very
nearly
knocked
Catherine
Crane
over
in
his
preoccupation
.
He
caught
her
elbow
to
steady
her
.
"
Sorry
,
not
looking
where
I
'm
going
.
I
'm
off
home
for
the
morning
,
but
you
're
wanted
to
come
with
me
to
see
a
VIP
about
a
missing
person
.
Walk
along
and
I
'll
tell
you
about
it
.
"
He
told
her
everything
he
knew
,
and
made
sure
she
understood
where
to
be
and
at
what
time
,
talking
with
the
speed
of
true
exhaustion
and
repeating
himself
.
He
stopped
,
realizing
what
he
was
doing
,
and
looked
at
her
carefully
to
see
if
she
had
taken
it
in
.
She
looked
back
at
him
and
smiled
gently
,
and
he
saw
that
she
had
been
writing
in
a
workman-like
leather-bound
notebook
.
"
Yes
,
sir
.
Got
it
.
"
"
Don
"
t
call
me
sir
,
"
he
said
sharply
.
"
Everyone
calls
me
John
,
"
he
added
mendaciously
.
Her
smile
widened
,
and
she
nodded
,
pleased
but
unsurprised
.
He
rested
his
eyes
on
her
,
very
conscious
of
the
smooth
skin
and
her
flowery
perfume
.
Gathering
himself
,
he
dismissed
her
and
went
down
to
the
waiting
car
.
Four
miles
away
,
Francesca
had
already
reached
her
own
small
Victorian
house
and
was
moving
clothes
from
the
dryer
straight
into
a
battered
suitcase
.
"
Six
pairs
of
knickers
must
be
enough
,
must
n't
it
,
Charlie
?
"
she
enquired
of
a
tall
dark-blond
young
man
,
unmistakably
her
brother
,
who
was
piling
plates
into
a
dishwasher
and
making
two
cups
of
coffee
.
"
Heap
good
laundries
in
New
York
,
darling
.
How
was
John
?
"
"
Oh
God
.
Furious
.
And
miserable
.
I
felt
awful
.
"
Charlie
emerged
from
the
kitchen
and
handed
her
a
cup
.
"
I
really
am
sorry
.
I
would
go
instead
of
you
but
I
ca
n't
,
can
I
,
with
Mum
sick
and
the
baby
due
any
day
?
"
"
No
,
Charlie
,
of
course
you
can
"
t
,
we
've
been
through
that
.
And
Jeremy
ca
n't
manage
on
his
own
,
he
's
just
too
young
.
It
does
have
to
be
me
.
"
Her
brother
watched
her
,
with
love
and
anxiety
,
as
she
checked
the
contents
of
her
handbag
.
"
Were
n't
you
and
John
going
skiing
soon
?
"
"
We
were
.
We
are
.
We
have
to
get
a
week
together
.
He
's
been
so
busy
catching
murderers
we
've
hardly
seen
each
other
for
three
weeks
.
He
never
stops
working
.
"
"
You
need
to
marry
him
.
He
loves
you
,
he
's
a
good
bloke
,
you
've
been
together
for
over
a
year
.
He
's
going
up
the
ladder
like
a
rocket
,
is
n't
he
?
He
does
n't
have
time
for
all
this
.
"
Charlie
watched
Francesca
's
vivid
face
go
wooden
as
she
counted
currency
.
"
He
does
still
want
to
marry
you
,
I
take
it
?
"
"
Oh
yes
.
"
She
spoke
with
dismissive
confidence
.
"
It
's
always
been
me
who
said
no
.
"
Her
brother
,
closing
her
suitcase
for
her
,
regarded
her
with
exasperation
.
"
You
're
nearly
thirty
.
It
"
s
time
you
settled
down
and
had
children
.
"
"
You
've
been
reading
Jane
's
magazines
again
.
"
Francesca
silenced
him
,
as
she
had
meant
to
;
his
wife
Jane
,
unlike
his
academically
gifted
sister
,
had
done
the
domestic
science
course
at
her
school
.
He
jerked
her
case
upright
,
tight-lipped
,
and
put
it
by
the
door
for
her
,
but
relaxed
in
exasperated
pity
as
he
watched
her
start
to
check
her
handbag
for
the
third
time
.
"
I
suppose
we
are
right
to
send
you
and
Jeremy
out
to
get
Tristram
rather
than
leave
him
to
take
the
full
consequences
?
"
he
said
reflectively
,
as
he
loaded
her
and
her
possessions
into
his
car
and
took
the
wheel
.
"
I
could
n't
possibly
not
go
,
"
Francesca
said
,
pushing
a
cassette-tape
into
the
car
recorder
.
"
It
's
Tris
's
demo-tape
,
"
she
said
in
explanation
,
and
both
listened
,
cut
off
in
concentration
,
as
a
pure
high
tenor
,
singing
"
Plaisirs
d'Amour
"
filled
the
car
.
"
Listen
to
that
top
A.
Better
range
than
Perry
,
you
know
,
"
Francesca
said
,
softly
.
"
Does
n't
project
like
Perry
does
.
"
Charlie
started
quietly
to
sing
with
the
tape
,
and
his
sister
joined
him
,
both
stretching
for
the
top
notes
.
They
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
as
they
went
for
the
top
A
and
each
found
that
no
noise
came
out
at
all
.
"
I
always
think
it
's
very
nice
of
you
not
to
mind
being
a
baritone
rather
than
a
tenor
,
Charlie
.
I
would
give
my
eyeteeth
to
be
a
soprano
,
and
to
be
able
to
get
that
high
.
"
"
Or
even
higher
.
Tris
has
a
reliable
top
C
,
which
is
more
than
Perry
does
.
"
They
fell
silent
,
listening
as
the
tape
finished
.
"
He
spits
his
final
consonants
out
as
if
he
were
still
at
St
Joe
's
,
"
Francesca
observed
with
love
and
Charlie
sighed
.
"
All
right
.
You
go
and
get
Tristram
out
of
durance
vile
,
helped
or
handicapped
by
Jeremy
-
for
the
sake
of
his
talent
,
if
nothing
else
.
And
let's
just
hope
your
life
is
where
you
left
it
when
you
come
back
.
"
McLeish
and
Catherine
Crane
were
expected
and
escorted
quickly
to
the
Minister
's
Private
Office
.
McLeish
knew
roughly
what
it
would
be
like
from
Francesca
's
description
of
her
own
Department
,
but
he
was
still
interested
in
the
controlled
bustle
in
the
big
untidy
room
.
The
Private
Secretary
,
a
dark
,
stocky
man
a
couple
of
years
McLeish
's
junior
,
greeted
him
,
observing
cautiously
that
they
had
surely
met
at
Francesca
Wilson
's
house
?
He
then
did
a
double-take
at
the
sight
of
Catherine
Crane
,
who
had
been
the
object
of
the
most
careful
attention
from
everyone
else
in
the
room
from
the
minute
she
had
arrived
.
"
The
Minister
is
just
finishing
a
phone
call
,
then
I
must
tell
him
one
thing
before
he
sees
you
,
"
he
said
,
briskly
,
glancing
at
the
miniature
switchboard
beside
him
which
sat
incongruously
in
the
draughty
,
high-ceilinged
,
dingy
room
.
A
light
flicked
off
,
and
he
knocked
and
disappeared
into
his
master
's
office
,
leaving
McLeish
and
Catherine
by
his
desk
.
A
dazzled
junior
seized
the
opportunity
to
press
tea
on
them
both
,
his
eyes
never
leaving
Catherine
,
and
McLeish
,
amused
,
accepted
a
cup
.
"
The
Treasury
exists
to
stand
in
front
of
the
safe
,
shouting
"
Go
away
!
"
and
making
threatening
gestures
at
any
Department
who
comes
near
it
or
them
,
"
he
remembered
Francesca
's
clear
,
amused
voice
explaining
the
system
.
"
But
in
the
end
they
get
pushed
over
;
they
just
manage
to
delay
the
bigger-spending
Departments
a
bit
,
And
they
pop
up
again
,
good
as
new
,
the
next
time
,
like
a
row
of
skittles
.
"
The
Private
Secretary
-
Michael
Marsden
,
he
remembered
with
an
effort
-
signalled
them
from
the
door
and
McLeish
moved
forward
,
keen
to
see
what
the
kingpin
of
this
row
of
skittles
looked
like
.
His
first
thought
,
as
he
shook
the
hand
of
the
distinctive
dark
man
almost
as
tall
as
himself
,
was
that
Francesca
must
have
got
it
wrong
this
time
.
Giles
Hawick
was
not
the
sort
of
man
you
could
flatten
easily
,
and
if
you
managed
it
,
he
would
not
pop
up
,
bright
,
smiling
and
bearing
no
grudge
,
to
face
you
the
next
ti
me
.
If
you
injured
this
one
,
it
would
be
as
well
to
kill
him
before
he
killed
you
.
McLeish
stepped
back
,
surprised
at
the
force
of
his
reaction
,
and
introduced
Catherine
Crane
,
watching
Giles
Hawick
carefully
.
The
high
,
arched
eyebrows
in
the
long
bony
face
rose
slightly
in
surprise
,
but
no
more
.
The
immediate
impression
of
directed
dominance
did
not
come
from
the
man
's
physique
,
impressive
though
that
was
,
McLeish
decided
as
he
accepted
the
offered
chair
and
placed
Catherine
at
the
side
of
the
room
.
Giles
Hawick
was
a
beautifully
put
together
man
,
something
over
six
foot
without
a
spare
ounce
of
flesh
anywhere
,
the
long
lines
in
the
face
being
particularly
strong
.
Nor
were
the
very
deep-set
dark
brown
eyes
particularly
hypnotic
,
as
journalists
occasionally
suggested
.
It
was
the
controlled
,
economical
force
that
emanated
from
the
man
that
was
impressive
,
and
the
speed
with
which
he
absorbed
information
.
In
about
two
minutes
he
had
established
precisely
which
members
of
C1
he
was
dealing
with
and
why
.
John
McLeish
,
himself
a
forceful
character
,
felt
as
if
he
had
been
put
through
a
wringer
.
He
waited
,
out
of
long
experience
with
dominant
characters
,
until
a
natural
break
occurred
and
used
it
to
ask
for
some
background
,
starting
with
how
long
the
Minister
had
known
Miss
Morgan
.
Giles
Hawick
,
looking
surprised
,
sat
more
easily
in
his
chair
and
started
to
marshal
his
thoughts
.
"
I
've
known
her
a
couple
of
years
.
We
met
when
she
came
with
the
chairman
of
one
of
the
big
contractors
to
lobby
me
about
increasing
the
road-building
programme
,
when
I
was
a
spokesman
for
Transport
.
She
was
working
for
Yeo
Davis
,
where
she
is
a
partner
now
.
A
case
of
gamekeeper
turned
poacher
,
given
that
she
had
been
a
fast-stream
entrant
to
the
Treasury
,
much
of
whose
function
it
is
to
resist
that
sort
of
demand
.
"
Francesca
might
have
it
right
after
all
,
McLeish
thought
,
enjoying
the
turn
of
phrase
.
"
I
liked
the
look
of
Angela
,
and
organized
an
introduction
through
a
mutual
acquaintance
.
"
Not
being
prepared
to
be
beholden
to
those
who
were
lobbying
you
,
McLeish
observed
,
considering
the
formidable
professional
across
the
table
.
"
My
first
wife
died
some
years
ago
,
as
you
may
know
.
At
the
time
I
met
her
,
Angela
told
me
that
she
was
involved
with
someone
else
.
Women
make
their
own
minds
up
about
what
they
want
to
do
,
I
find
,
so
I
left
it
;
but
about
a
year
ago
she
invited
me
to
a
party
and
indicated
that
whoever
it
had
been
was
no
longer
around
.
I
was
very
pleased
,
and
we
,
well
,
we
wasted
no
time
.
We
intend
to
marry
in
April
,
immediately
after
the
House
rises
.
"
He
stopped
and
stared
out
of
the
window
,
across
Horse
Guards
'
,
looking
suddenly
weary
.
"
Have
you
talked
to
her
family
?
"
"
Not
yet
,
sir
.
"
"
They
are
very
distressed
.
There
are
only
two
children
,
both
daughters
.
Angela
is
the
younger
.
"
"
Is
there
much
difference
in
age
?
"
"
Four
years
.
Jennifer
has
not
married
yet
.
She
's
a
very
attractive
girl
.
In
fact
I
took
her
out
a
couple
of
times
myself
when
I
found
that
Angela
was
occupied
with
someone
else
.
I
get
on
well
with
them
all
,
actually
.
I
think
Francis
Morgan
feels
I
'm
a
bit
old
for
Angela
-
I
'm
forty-three
and
she
is
twenty-nine
-
but
he
's
never
brought
himself
to
say
so
.
And
Sarah
Morgan
likes
the
idea
of
Angela
marrying
someone
in
the
government
.
"
McLeish
considered
this
cold
and
rational
assessment
.
"
When
did
you
last
see
her
?
Miss
Angela
Morgan
,
I
mean
.
"
"
Early
on
Saturday
morning
-
about
eight-thirty
.
I
did
n't
expect
to
see
her
again
until
late
on
Monday
-
I
went
off
to
do
some
walking
for
the
weekend
and
was
taking
an
extra
day
.
I
rang
her
on
Monday
night
and
got
no
answer
,
but
that
did
n't
worry
me
.
I
was
having
lunch
with
her
on
Tuesday
.
She
did
n't
turn
up
,
so
of
course
I
then
telephoned
her
office
and
found
she
had
n't
been
there
that
week
.
I
rang
her
parents
yesterday
-
Wednesday
.
I
had
n't
wanted
to
worry
them
before
.
Today
I
felt
I
could
leave
things
no
longer
,
so
I
had
a
word
with
a
colleague
in
the
Home
Office
.
Perhaps
I
should
have
done
it
before
,
but
I
suppose
one
's
always
afraid
of
making
a
fool
of
oneself
.
"
McLeish
decided
it
was
unlikely
that
that
sort
of
consideration
very
much
exercised
this
cool
customer
.
"
You
had
no
idea
where
she
might
be
?
"
"
I
would
not
have
called
you
in
if
I
had
,
would
I
?
Sorry
,
but
I
can
not
imagine
what
has
happened
.
What
has
usually
happened
when
people
vanish
?
"
McLeish
took
a
minute
to
formulate
his
reply
,
and
Giles
Hawick
got
it
at
once
.
"
They
've
gone
off
with
someone
.
"
"
They
've
mostly
gone
voluntarily
,
yes
,
sir
.
"
"
That
's
what
your
boss
was
trying
to
indicate
.
"
Giles
Hawick
looked
down
at
his
blotter
,
lips
tight
with
tension
.
"
Angela
is
a
very
attractive
woman
and
also
very
forthright
.
If
she
'd
wanted
to
go
off
with
someone
else
,
she
would
just
have
said
so
.
Please
,
Chief
Inspector
,
put
that
out
of
your
mind
.
I
want
the
police
to
look
for
her
,
not
humour
me
.
Where
do
you
start
?
"
"
With
the
hospitals
and
any
reports
of
unidentified
persons
found
dead
.
"
McLeish
decided
there
was
no
point
tempering
the
wind
to
this
competent
and
well-clad
lamb
.
"
We
'll
also
circulate
her
description
,
and
if
you
have
a
good
,
recent
photograph
that
would
be
very
helpful
.
"
"
We
'd
just
had
some
done
for
our
engagement
.
My
Private
Secretary
will
find
them
.
"
Giles
Hawick
suddenly
looked
tired
and
McLeish
felt
for
him
,
as
he
promised
to
keep
him
in
touch
with
their
investigations
.
Not
much
danger
of
his
Commander
letting
him
slip
up
on
that
,
he
thought
drily
.
They
rose
to
go
,
Giles
Hawick
with
the
politician
's
automatic
competence
escorting
them
to
the
lift
and
warmly
asking
Catherine
Crane
where
she
had
trained
and
how
she
liked
her
job
.
He
showed
them
into
the
lift
,
shaking
hands
with
them
both
,
and
as
Catherine
turned
away
from
him
to
press
the
lift
button
,
he
suddenly
raised
his
eyebrows
at
McLeish
in
amusement
at
his
own
response
to
her
.
"
In
what
circumstances
would
an
attractive
woman
of
twenty-nine
walk
out
on
a
fiance
without
telling
him
or
anyone
else
where
she
was
going
?
"
McLeish
asked
Catherine
as
they
walked
back
through
St
James
's
Park
.
"
If
she
was
frightened
of
him
?
"
She
sounded
doubtful
,
but
McLeish
decided
it
would
be
possible
to
be
frightened
of
Giles
Hawick
.
He
had
the
look
of
a
man
with
a
nasty
temper
if
you
got
on
his
wrong
side
.
"
But
presumably
the
Commander
does
n't
think
she
ran
away
?
I
mean
Special
Branch
has
asked
us
to
come
in
.
They
all
think
something
's
happened
to
her
,
do
n't
they
?
"
She
might
sound
diffident
,
McLeish
thought
,
amused
,
but
she
was
n't
,
just
more
careful
than
his
blunt
Francesca
about
how
she
made
her
points
.
"
I
agree
.
I
do
n't
like
the
sound
of
it
at
all
.
The
best
we
could
hope
for
is
that
she
's
had
a
brainstorm
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
often
that
happens
outside
of
books
.
Anyway
,
we
need
to
get
back
and
get
the
procedures
into
place
.
"
All
that
took
some
five
hours
for
very
little
result
.
By
ten
p.m
.
McLeish
was
reasonably
satisfied
that
Angela
Morgan
was
not
lying
unidentified
in
any
morgue
,
nor
in
any
hospital
,
unconscious
or
suffering
from
loss
of
memory
.
Tomorrow
he
would
have
to
talk
to
her
family
and
last
known
associates
.
Remembering
that
he
had
sent
Catherine
Crane
to
see
Angela
Morgan
's
employers
,
he
decided
to
find
out
how
she
had
got
on
;
late
as
it
was
he
did
not
think
she
would
have
gone
off
duty
without
reporting
to
him
.
He
got
half-way
down
the
corridor
and
realized
in
irritation
that
he
had
no
idea
where
she
had
been
given
an
office
.
That
small
problem
solved
itself
readily
:
one
door
stood
open
with
Bruce
Davidson
leaning
on
the
side
in
a
careful
presentation
of
a
man
who
had
just
happened
to
be
passing
.
He
stood
aside
for
McLeish
,
then
took
himself
off
,
observing
unnecessarily
that
he
just
had
a
wee
bit
paperwork
to
finish
up
.
Catherine
Crane
,
installed
behind
her
desk
,
gave
him
a
slightly
weary
smile
.
She
looked
,
McLeish
observed
,
as
immaculate
as
she
had
in
the
morning
,
but
she
was
pale
and
her
eyes
looked
huge
.
"
I
've
got
some
useful
stuff
from
Yeo
Davis
-
that
's
Miss
Morgan
's
employers
,
sir
,
I
mean
,
John
.
Her
diary
for
last
week
and
the
week
before
.
She
had
a
lot
of
appointments
,
particularly
at
lunch
.
I
've
listed
them
.
"
He
peered
at
the
long
list
.
"
What
does
she
do
?
"
"
Yeo
Davis
advise
on
government
and
parliamentary
affairs
.
"
"
What
does
that
mean
they
do
?
"
"
Mr
Yeo
did
explain
it
,
but
I
'm
not
quite
sure
I
see
it
,
even
so
.
He
says
they
help
companies
to
influence
government
decisions
and
legislation
.
"
McLeish
decided
he
did
n't
understand
it
either
but
he
was
n't
about
to
discourage
Sergeant
Crane
.
"
OK
,
let's
have
a
look
at
the
list
.
Last
Monday
,
appointment
at
the
Ministry
of
Defence
,
lunch
with
Hugo
Brett
MP
,
afternoon
date
with
Charles
Council
,
drinks
at
the
Reform
.
Tuesday
,
more
of
the
same
,
except
she
seems
to
have
met
Mr
Hawick
at
the
House
of
Commons
after
work
.
Wednesday
,
she
sees
a
chap
who
is
one
of
the
PM
's
advisers
,
or
that
's
what
it
says
-
and
what
does
she
do
for
lunch
?
Blow
me
,
I
do
n't
believe
it
!
"
"
What
?
"
"
That
Wednesday
she
had
lunch
with
one
F.
Wilson
,
DTI
.
That
's
one
person
I
know
where
to
find
.
"
"
Who
is
it
?
"
"
A
girl
called
Francesca
Wilson
,
who
is
doing
work
that
involves
rescuing
dud
companies
which
employ
a
lot
of
people
in
difficult
areas
.
"
He
hesitated
,
not
sure
why
he
was
being
cautious
.
"
In
fact
,
she
's
my
girlfriend
.
"
Catherine
Crane
smiled
at
him
gently
.
"
Well
,
that
is
easy
enough
for
you
,
is
n't
it
?
Are
you
seeing
her
tonight
?
"
McLeish
scowled
,
reminded
.
"
No
,
she
's
in
New
York
.
"
He
glanced
sideways
at
Catherine
Crane
's
unchanged
expression
which
showed
merely
courteous
interest
,
and
decided
to
sit
down
and
talk
.
"
Francesca
's
got
four
brothers
,
see
,
two
of
them
professional
singers
,
two
of
them
by
the
grace
of
God
ordinary
working
stiffs
in
respectable
offices
.
"
He
paused
,
trying
to
decide
how
to
go
on
,
noticing
how
dirty
the
walls
of
the
small
,
dark
office
looked
against
Catherine
Crane
's
neat
,
pale
suit
and
bright
blond
hair
.
"
Is
one
of
them
Perry
Wilson
?
"
she
enquired
,
visibly
impressed
.
"
Yes
.
He
's
OK
.
Well
,
he
's
not
,
but
he
's
not
causing
any
difficulty
just
at
the
moment
.
There
are
twins
at
the
bottom
of
the
family
and
it
's
Tristram
who
's
in
trouble
.
Done
for
possession
of
Class
A
drugs
in
New
York
.
"
"
That
is
difficult
.
"
"
And
Francesca
's
there
to
try
and
get
him
out
on
bail
.
"
"
Does
n't
he
have
a
lawyer
?
"
"
Good
question
.
Fran
's
gone
to
make
sure
no
one
lays
a
finger
on
a
brother
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
They
're
like
that
.
"
He
brooded
for
a
moment
,
sighed
,
and
reached
for
the
list
again
.
"
I
'll
be
able
to
talk
to
her
sooner
or
later
,
and
it
sounds
as
if
she
might
actually
be
useful
.
She
'll
at
least
be
able
to
explain
Yeo
Davis
to
us
.
Anything
else
on
Miss
Morgan
?
"
Catherine
Crane
moved
one
tidy
package
of
paper
,
neatly
tabulated
,
in
search
of
an
equally
tidy
pile
,
and
McLeish
watched
with
pleasure
.
Keeping
the
paperwork
straight
might
not
be
glamorous
but
it
was
eighty
per
cent
of
the
battle
as
he
well
knew
,
and
he
made
certain
his
staff
did
too
.
It
did
n't
look
as
if
that
particular
conversation
was
going
to
be
necessary
in
this
case
.
"
Sorry
,
here
we
are
.
Mr
Yeo
sent
us
her
CV
-
the
one
they
send
out
to
prospective
clients
.
Only
the
basic
facts
,
but
useful
.
And
some
spare
copies
of
the
photographs
that
came
out
from
the
DTI
this
afternoon
-
we
ran
off
dozens
to
send
out
to
the
regional
forces
,
but
I
snaffled
six
.
"
McLeish
took
the
photographs
and
considered
them
.
A
lively
,
arrogant
face
,
rather
square
,
eyes
wide-set
,
and
a
full
,
curving
mouth
.
Dark
brown
hair
,
dark
brown
eyes
,
and
slightly
sallow
skin
which
the
photographer
had
not
bothered
to
disguise
or
retouch
,
having
understood
that
this
was
part
of
her
charm
.
Not
a
true
beauty
,
but
the
girl
beckoned
you
off
the
paper
;
confident
,
sexy
,
that
face
invited
you
to
join
in
if
you
could
stand
the
pace
.
A
handful
,
McLeish
thought
,
but
a
lot
of
fun
.
He
reached
for
the
CV
while
Catherine
Crane
busied
herself
systematically
with
her
papers
.
Same
age
as
Francesca
,
and
had
attended
the
same
good
North
London
all-girls
'
grammar
school
,
for
entry
to
which
aspiring
parents
would
have
been
prepared
to
pay
blood-money
had
there
been
anyone
in
the
austere
intellectual
governing
body
and
teaching
staff
who
would
have
taken
it
.
They
must
have
been
the
same
year
,
for
their
birthdays
were
only
two
months
apart
.
Even
among
perhaps
a
hundred
girls
in
their
year
,
they
must
have
known
each
other
quite
well
.
Their
ways
had
diverged
at
university
-
Angela
Morgan
had
gone
on
to
Oxford
to
read
English
,
the
fatherless
Francesca
,
under
more
pressure
to
make
a
living
,
had
gone
to
Cambridge
to
read
law
.
A
clever
girl
,
though
,
Miss
Morgan
,
an
Exhibitioner
like
Francesca
and
a
respectable
second-class
degree
.
He
considered
the
arrogant
,
attractive
,
knowing
face
again
and
put
the
photo
down
,
shifting
his
attention
to
Catherine
's
pale
,
classic
beauty
.
He
was
about
to
divide
up
responsibility
for
checking
Angela
Morgan
's
last
recorded
movements
when
Bruce
Davidson
knocked
and
put
his
head
in
.
"
John
.
It
's
Francesca
,
on
the
phone
from
New
York
,
says
will
you
hurry
.
"
McLeish
jogged
down
the
passage
,
overcoming
irritation
.
Of
course
he
had
the
sense
to
hurry
when
she
was
hanging
on
a
line
from
New
York
.
"
Talk
more
slowly
,
"
he
said
,
in
exasperation
,
after
the
first
few
seconds
.
She
was
sounding
strained
,
and
as
always
when
she
was
over-extended
she
was
being
unnecessarily
bossy
.
Her
sigh
of
exasperation
reached
him
from
3,000
miles
away
.
"
Sorry
,
but
I
've
been
at
it
all
day
.
"
"
Well
,
calm
down
.
I
need
to
talk
to
you
,
too
.
"
"
What
about
?
"
Francesca
sounded
rattled
and
hostile
,
and
McLeish
gazed
at
the
wall
,
wondering
if
he
had
really
been
in
love
with
her
for
over
a
year
.
"
About
someone
called
Angela
Morgan
whom
you
or
another
F.
Wilson
at
the
DTI
had
lunch
with
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
.
She
's
been
reported
missing
and
we
're
checking
her
movements
for
the
two
weeks
before
she
vanished
.
"
A
dead
silence
ensued
and
he
shook
the
phone
.
"
Francesca
?
"
"
Sorry
,
yes
.
It
was
me
.
But
why
are
you
doing
this
,
John
?
Do
you
think
she
's
dead
?
"
Well
,
at
least
Francesca
's
mind
appeared
to
be
functioning
on
a
subject
unconnected
with
her
damned
brothers
,
McLeish
thought
grimly
.
"
Not
necessarily
.
She
was
reported
missing
by
her
fiance
.
"
"
Giles
Hawick
.
Does
he
think
she
's
dead
?
"
"
He
hopes
she
is
lying
in
hospital
somewhere
,
having
lost
her
memory
.
"
"
And
she
is
n't
?
"
"
Not
as
of
an
hour
ago
,
no
.
"
"
She
's
gone
off
with
another
bloke
,
bet
you
anything
.
"
McLeish
grinned
at
the
telephone
.
"
I
did
n't
think
she
was
one
of
your
mates
.
But
you
were
at
school
with
her
?
"
"
Yes
I
was
,
but
we
were
never
that
close
.
Different
subjects
for
a
start
.
"
There
was
a
pause
while
she
gathered
her
thoughts
and
McLeish
waited
patiently
.
"
What
do
you
know
about
her
,
John
?
"
"
Bugger
all
,
at
the
moment
.
I
've
got
a
photograph
.
"
"
Then
you
know
quite
a
lot
,
if
it
is
a
good
one
.
Of
all
the
women
I
know
,
she
is
by
far
the
most
successful
with
men
,
even
though
she
is
n't
the
best-looking
.
She
is
the
original
man-trap
.
"
John
McLeish
blinked
at
the
telephone
.
Francesca
's
judgement
was
typically
over-judicial
and
conscientiously
unemotional
,
but
this
had
real
force
behind
it
.
He
had
never
heard
Francesca
giving
vent
to
feminine
jealousy
and
on
the
whole
he
found
the
experience
refreshing
.
"
You
'd
better
explain
to
me
what
it
is
she
does
as
a
job
.
Hang
on
-
I
'll
ring
you
back
,
the
Yard
can
pay
this
bill
.
"
"
That
's
all
right
,
I
'm
in
a
mate
's
office
.
"
"
Well
,
I
hope
the
Senator
can
afford
it
.
"
"
I
'm
sure
he
can
.
"
A
real
advantage
of
his
girl
,
McLeish
thought
grimly
,
was
that
she
never
lied
if
asked
directly
.
She
might
not
volunteer
the
truth
all
the
time
,
but
ask
her
and
you
got
a
straight
answer
.
"
Angela
is
a
lobbyist
.
"
Francesca
made
it
sound
like
someone
who
came
to
clean
the
telephone
.
"
That
's
not
what
Yeo
Davis
call
themselves
-
I
think
they
use
some
phrase
like
"
government
and
parliamentary
relations
"
.
They
help
clients
to
push
the
right
buttons
in
government
in
the
UK
-
and
increasingly
,
of
course
,
in
the
EEC
.
It
's
a
perfectly
respectable
trade
,
"
she
added
conscientiously
.
"
I
do
n't
mind
lobbyists
,
I
'd
just
rather
they
called
themselves
by
their
proper
name
as
they
do
in
Washington
,
rather
than
wittering
on
for
hours
about
relationships
with
opinion-formers
.
Angela
got
up
my
nose
as
usual
on
this
point
over
lunch
,
banging
on
about
the
importance
of
seeing
that
Ministers
were
properly
informed
and
by
the
right
people
.
as
if
the
Civil
Service
spent
all
its
time
obfuscating
issues
and
introducing
Ministers
to
the
wrong
people
.
"
McLeish
decided
that
it
was
probably
not
the
moment
to
suggest
to
her
that
the
real
reason
any
civil
servant
disliked
lobbyists
must
be
that
the
chaps
were
paid
to
make
sure
Ministers
got
a
view
other
than
the
Departmental
one
.
"
Can
you
give
me
an
example
of
what
they
do
?
I
mean
,
why
was
Miss
Morgan
having
lunch
with
you
,
or
was
that
just
for
old
time
's
sake
?
"
"
No
,
no
,
I
now
rank
as
an
important
contact
,
a
senior
opinion-former
,
or
so
she
flatteringly
told
me
.
It
was
quite
a
good
example
of
lobbying
,
in
fact
.
It
's
widely
known
-
because
the
unions
have
publicized
it
-
that
the
Department
is
looking
at
bailing
out
Huerter
Textiles
.
Henry
and
I
are
doing
it
,
as
the
resident
textile
rescue-squad
.
You
just
have
n't
heard
about
it
because
you
've
been
too
busy
.
"
Trust
Francesca
to
get
her
points
in
while
she
could
,
McLeish
thought
irritably
.
"
And
her
firm
is
working
for
Huerter
?
"
"
No
,
no
,
quite
the
contrary
.
Her
firm
,
Yeo
Davis
,
is
working
for
Barton
Mills
,
which
is
the
other
really
big
surviving
textile
company
in
the
north-west
.
Their
chief
executive
,
Andy
Barton
,
feels
,
with
some
reason
one
would
have
to
say
,
that
it
is
n't
right
that
the
government
should
bail
out
a
competitor
.
The
point
is
,
darling
,
that
in
order
to
make
sure
Huerter
has
a
future
,
we
would
have
to
put
a
lot
of
money
in
to
restore
a
bombed-out
balance
sheet
.
Barton
has
heavy
borrowings
too
,
and
to
put
it
crudely
,
if
they
're
paying
interest
and
Huerter
is
n't
,
Huerter
ought
to
be
able
to
undercut
them
in
the
market
.
"
"
So
Miss
Morgan
was
making
sure
you
'd
understood
all
that
?
I
see
where
it
annoyed
you
.
"
Francesca
was
not
amused
.
"
Yes
,
well
,
it
is
an
offensively
elementary
consideration
and
one
to
which
Ministers
'
attention
had
been
drawn
.
Yeo
Davis
seem
to
have
felt
,
nonetheless
,
that
it
was
worth
a
lunch
.
"
She
paused
.
"
I
'd
have
to
say
that
given
the
change
of
government
they
ought
to
have
a
very
good
chance
of
preventing
us
assisting
Huerter
.
I
mean
,
this
lot
did
come
in
,
only
six
months
ago
,
announcing
that
everyone
would
have
to
stand
on
their
own
feet
and
not
be
rescued
,
and
face
up
to
competition
,
and
all
that
.
But
whatever
they
said
,
as
you
know
they
have
n't
actually
done
any
of
it
yet
-
they
did
rescue
Fryers
and
Towyn
Metals
,
using
tax-payers
'
money
,
just
like
they
said
they
would
n't
.
Yeo
Davis
could
have
credibly
warned
Barton
that
,
whatever
the
public
statements
,
there
was
a
real
risk
that
Huerter
would
be
bailed
out
.
"
McLeish
considered
this
,
"
Are
lobbyists
well
paid
?
"
"
Yes
.
Not
that
Angela
needed
the
money
.
"
"
Rich
girl
,
is
she
?
"
"
Very
.
She
did
n't
earn
it
in
any
conventional
sense
:
her
last
employer
left
one
third
of
his
substantial
fortune
to
her
outright
,
and
another
third
for
life
.
His
family
-
a
sister
and
niece
as
I
remember
-
was
awfully
cross
.
This
was
about
two
years
ago
.
"
McLeish
told
Francesca
to
hang
on
while
he
got
this
down
as
a
note
,
and
stared
at
the
result
.
It
made
a
good
reason
for
those
excluded
to
dislike
Miss
Morgan
,
but
it
had
been
true
any
time
these
past
two
years
.
"
When
you
had
lunch
,
how
was
she
?
I
mean
,
it
did
n't
sound
as
if
she
had
plans
to
go
off
with
someone
else
.
"
In
the
silence
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
he
heard
Francesca
think
.
"
No
,
she
did
n't
come
over
like
that
,
not
at
all
.
In
fact
,
she
was
excited
in
an
innocent
way
about
the
wedding
plans
.
Reception
at
the
House
,
all
very
grand
and
smart
.
And
awfully
good
for
her
business
,
too
.
"
McLeish
smiled
to
himself
at
the
swift
fall
from
grace
in
the
postscript
.
Prodding
gently
,
he
got
Francesca
to
run
through
the
substance
of
the
lunch-time
conversation
.
It
was
clear
that
Miss
Morgan
's
brain
had
been
fully
engaged
on
what
she
was
doing
,
which
was
pushing
a
client
's
interest
,
and
that
such
attention
as
she
could
spare
from
that
had
been
centred
on
her
forthcoming
marriage
.
Nothing
at
all
there
,
five
days
before
her
disappearance
,
to
suggest
she
was
planning
to
vanish
.
Francesca
's
attention
would
have
been
undivided
as
well
,
as
that
lunch
had
taken
place
before
Tristram
had
managed
to
get
himself
so
comprehensively
into
trouble
.
McLeish
remembered
abruptly
Francesca
's
chief
preoccupation
.
"
How
are
you
getting
on
over
there
?
"
he
asked
,
cautiously
.
"
Much
fixing
is
going
on
.
I
'm
basically
just
biting
my
fingernails
and
holding
Tristram
together
.
He
has
been
bailed
on
several
sureties
and
appears
in
court
tomorrow
.
"
She
was
sounding
terse
and
McLeish
decided
not
to
ask
her
any
more
details
over
the
transatlantic
phone
.
"
I
've
told
them
here
I
do
n't
need
the
week
after
next
off
,
"
he
said
,
as
levelly
as
he
could
.
"
Oh
,
John
.
"
She
sounded
appalled
.
"
I
'd
managed
to
hang
on
to
it
.
Why
ever
did
you
do
that
?
"
"
How
was
I
supposed
to
know
?
"
he
said
,
instantly
aware
that
he
had
acted
too
hastily
because
he
had
been
so
angry
with
her
.
"
Well
,
I
said
I
'd
call
you
.
I
ought
to
be
home
in
three
days
and
I
've
made
a
deal
with
Henry
.
That
was
just
plain
bloody-minded
of
you
.
"
"
Coming
from
you
,
that
's
ridiculous
!
"
A
combination
of
justified
annoyance
,
guilt
and
weeks
of
overwork
blew
John
McLeish
's
temper
to
shreds
instantly
,
and
Francesca
,
seriously
over-stressed
and
not
one
to
duck
a
quarrel
at
the
best
of
times
,
responded
in
kind
.
She
banged
the
phone
down
a
second
before
he
did
,
leaving
him
raging
.
Ten
minutes
later
he
had
calmed
down
sufficiently
to
make
himself
a
cup
of
coffee
and
write
himself
a
note
to
check
Angela
Morgan
's
financial
status
.
He
bethought
himself
guiltily
of
Sergeant
Crane
,
who
might
be
assumed
to
be
waiting
to
continue
the
conversation
that
Francesca
's
call
had
interrupted
,
and
padded
down
the
corridor
.
Her
office
was
now
marked
by
a
frieze
of
officers
,
two
lounging
half
in
and
half
out
of
her
door
,
a
third
a
little
behind
,
the
attention
of
all
three
directed
entirely
towards
her
desk
.
Two
of
the
three
moved
off
as
he
arrived
,
with
unconvincing
references
to
waiting
papers
,
but
Bruce
Davidson
stood
his
ground
,
enquiring
heartily
how
Francesca
was
and
had
she
been
helpful
?
McLeish
considered
him
with
something
between
amusement
and
irritation
.
Bruce
was
pale
with
the
deep
pallor
that
overworked
CID
tend
to
acquire
in
London
in
the
dead
of
winter
,
seriously
overtired
and
overweight
.
But
he
was
alert
and
sparkling
,
his
motor
well
and
truly
turned
on
by
the
presence
of
Catherine
Crane
,
and
he
probably
was
n't
going
to
go
home
till
he
,
or
Catherine
,
dropped
in
their
tracks
.
"
She
was
fine
,
and
yes
she
was
,
"
he
said
,
dealing
with
Bruce
's
formal
question
.
"
And
it
'll
all
wait
till
the
morning
.
Go
home
,
Bruce
,
or
back
to
whatever
your
case
is
,
and
I
'll
have
a
word
with
Sergeant
Crane
.
"
He
nodded
decisively
,
and
equally
firmly
walked
into
her
office
and
closed
the
door
on
Davidson
's
hopeful
face
.
"
Sorry
,
but
that
phone
call
was
useful
.
"
He
ran
,
as
dispassionately
as
he
could
,
through
Francesca
's
account
of
her
lunch
with
Angela
Morgan
.
"
So
she
probably
did
n't
vanish
voluntarily
,
"
Catherine
Crane
said
,
in
summary
.
"
It
does
n't
sound
like
it
.
"
He
looked
unseeingly
at
the
beautiful
face
across
the
table
,
hearing
the
echo
of
his
quarrel
with
Francesca
,
feeling
his
mind
still
chuntering
on
in
justification
of
the
anger
that
had
led
him
to
cut
off
all
possibility
of
their
holiday
next
week
.
Well
,
he
had
been
fed
up
,
and
why
should
n't
he
be
?
He
was
fed
up
with
the
whole
situation
,
and
all
Francesca
's
family
.
"
Sir
-
John
,
is
there
anything
more
tonight
?
"
He
came
back
smartly
to
the
office
and
the
desk
on
which
he
was
leaning
.
"
No
,
sorry
.
Have
you
eaten
since
lunch
?
"
"
A
sandwich
and
lots
of
coffee
which
Sergeant
Davidson
brought
.
I
'm
fine
.
"
"
I
'm
not
.
I
'm
going
to
get
something
at
the
pub
on
my
way
home
.
Come
with
me
?
"
"
Thank
you
,
I
'd
like
to
.
"
She
smiled
at
him
and
he
smiled
back
,
cheered
by
the
thought
of
a
drink
and
something
to
eat
in
her
company
.
He
collected
her
as
soon
as
they
had
both
tidied
their
offices
,
McLeish
maliciously
enjoying
Davidson
's
obvious
chagrin
as
they
said
good-night
to
him
on
the
way
out
.
"
A
good
man
,
that
,
"
he
said
,
guiltily
,
to
Catherine
as
they
went
down
in
the
lift
.
"
One
of
the
best
.
I
want
to
get
him
up
to
Inspector
as
soon
as
possible
.
"
"
He
has
been
very
helpful
.
"
McLeish
repressed
a
grin
and
bustled
into
the
big
noisy
pub
on
the
corner
,
receiving
an
instant
acknowledgement
from
one
of
the
bartenders
,
who
all
knew
any
member
of
the
C1
hierarchy
.
McLeish
carried
over
a
loaded
tray
,
and
ate
ravenously
,
noting
with
interest
that
Catherine
Crane
had
an
equally
good
appetite
,
though
it
was
not
obvious
where
she
was
putting
it
on
that
slim
frame
.
She
caught
his
eye
and
laughed
.
"
I
have
to
eat
about
five
times
a
day
,
or
I
just
stop
in
my
tracks
.
"
She
licked
her
fingers
and
applied
herself
to
her
beer
.
Like
Francesca
,
McLeish
thought
,
and
irritably
suppressed
the
reflection
.
"
Tell
me
about
you
.
Did
you
do
all
your
time
in
the
Met
,
or
did
you
start
up
north
?
"
"
No
,
I
came
straight
to
the
Met
from
school
at
eighteen
.
"
Left
home
as
soon
as
she
could
,
McLeish
observed
,
instead
of
starting
where
she
could
work
from
home
.
"
Do
you
still
have
family
in
wherever
it
is
-
Stoke
on
Trent
?
"
"
Yes
,
they
're
still
there
.
"
She
was
looking
wooden
,
and
McLeish
decided
to
move
off
this
point
,
but
she
forestalled
him
.
"
It
's
my
stepfather
and
mother
and
four
half-brothers
and
sisters
.
My
dad
was
killed
at
work
when
I
was
three
.
"
Does
n't
get
on
with
stepfather
,
McLeish
noted
mentally
,
listening
to
the
colour
in
her
voice
.
"
Where
are
you
living
now
?
"
"
I
've
just
bought
a
flat
.
"
McLeish
asked
whereabouts
and
discovered
it
was
three
roads
away
from
his
own
flat
,
so
they
complained
enjoyably
to
each
other
about
the
local
council
.
"
You
were
a
graduate
entry
,
were
n't
you
?
"
she
asked
as
this
conversation
ran
out
,
"
and
in
the
Flying
Squad
?
"
McLeish
,
warmed
by
the
fact
that
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
find
out
a
bit
about
him
,
confirmed
he
had
been
at
Reading
University
and
had
worked
as
a
young
sergeant
in
the
Flying
Squad
.
"
I
always
heard
graduates
were
n't
welcome
there
?
"
"
That
's
right
.
The
guv'nor
there
,
when
he
was
offered
me
,
wanted
quite
seriously
to
know
what
use
I
would
be
.
It
's
changing
now
.
But
they
took
me
in
then
because
one
of
my
mates
in
the
London
Scottish
was
in
the
Squad
.
They
gave
me
a
bad
time
-
they
'd
all
been
in
since
they
were
seventeen
and
they
were
hard
men
.
But
I
got
by
on
brute
force
and
ignorance
till
I
learnt
a
bit
.
"
She
gave
him
a
quick
amused
glance
,
her
head
leaning
back
against
the
faded
red
of
the
alcove
seat
.
"
The
man
who
brought
you
in
to
the
Squad
must
have
been
Alan
Jones
.
He
was
my
guv'nor
in
Tottenham
and
he
said
you
were
all
right
.
"
McLeish
beamed
at
her
,
more
than
pleased
with
this
recommendation
.
"
How
is
old
Alan
?
"
She
settled
down
to
tell
him
how
old
Alan
was
while
he
leant
forward
,
listening
with
pleasure
to
the
slightly
nasal
accent
of
Stoke
on
Trent
.
Her
judgement
of
Alan
Jones
was
both
admiring
and
shrewd
,
and
he
asked
about
her
own
education
,
becoming
aware
that
at
least
four
other
men
were
listening
with
great
interest
and
that
Catherine
Crane
was
so
used
to
this
that
she
was
unconscious
of
it
.
"
I
came
in
with
three
A
levels
,
"
she
said
,
matter
of
factly
.
"
I
was
at
Queen
Eleanor
's
and
they
urged
me
to
go
to
university
,
but
I
wanted
to
be
independent
,
so
I
came
into
the
Met
.
"
McLeish
nodded
,
his
impression
of
family
difficulty
confirmed
.
"
What
were
your
grades
?
"
"
Three
As
.
English
,
history
and
economics
.
"
"
Better
grades
than
mine
,
"
McLeish
said
,
impressed
.
"
Do
the
lads
get
at
you
,
too
?
"
"
Yes
,
a
bit
.
"
She
laughed
at
him
,
the
pretty
mouth
opening
to
reveal
small
,
even
teeth
.
"
But
I
do
n't
have
a
posh
set
of
in-laws
like
you
do
.
"
McLeish
,
more
sharply
than
he
had
meant
,
pointed
out
that
he
had
a
girlfriend
but
not
a
wife
.
"
This
is
a
good
pub
,
"
she
said
,
hastily
,
obviously
aware
of
having
trespassed
,
her
gaze
passing
over
the
heavy
plush
seating
and
lighting
on
one
of
the
barmen
who
was
openly
resting
his
eyes
on
her
as
he
polished
glasses
.
"
We
use
it
a
lot
.
"
He
followed
her
gaze
and
the
barman
lifted
his
right
hand
in
a
drink-pouring
gesture
,
nodding
at
the
same
time
towards
the
clock
which
showed
five
minutes
to
eleven
.
McLeish
indicated
equally
economically
that
no
more
drinks
would
be
required
.
"
I
've
got
my
car
in
.
Would
you
like
a
ride
home
?
"
he
asked
.
"
If
it
's
not
out
of
your
way
,
"
she
said
,
serenely
,
knowing
that
it
was
n't
,
and
McLeish
got
to
his
feet
,
savouring
self-consciously
the
sensation
of
being
whole-heartedly
envied
by
the
surrounding
male
drinkers
.
He
drove
her
sedately
home
.
Getting
out
to
open
the
passenger
door
for
her
,
he
noticed
that
,
in
contrast
to
Francesca
,
she
expected
this
and
accepted
the
courtesy
gratefully
.
"
I
'll
wait
while
you
let
yourself
in
,
"
he
said
,
in
an
attempt
at
sounding
policeman-like
,
and
she
smiled
at
him
.
"
Thanks
.
And
thanks
for
the
ride
.
"
She
had
her
key
ready
and
he
looked
down
at
her
for
a
minute
.
She
looked
back
,
her
eyes
wide
,
and
he
found
himself
holding
his
breath
.
"
Good-night
,
John
,
"
she
said
,
demurely
,
and
walked
up
her
front
steps
,
turning
to
wave
to
him
from
inside
the
house
.
The
boy
and
the
dog
skirted
round
opposite
sides
of
the
puddle
,
the
boy
,
a
light
,
tall
fourteen-year-old
,
labouring
in
wellington
boots
too
large
for
him
,
and
the
dog
,
a
three-year-old
Labrador
bitch
,
picking
her
way
reluctantly
,
with
frequent
pauses
,
as
if
her
paws
hurt
.
The
boy
,
unlike
the
dog
,
knew
that
the
mud
did
not
go
on
for
ever
;
beyond
the
bridge
,
the
disused
railway
embankment
along
which
they
were
walking
became
built
up
,
so
that
water
ran
off
it
.
He
pulled
the
dog
close
to
him
to
let
a
mixed
string
of
horses
and
Ponies
go
past
,
waving
shyly
to
the
lead
rider
,
a
pretty
,
capable
girl
an
unbridgeable
two
years
older
than
him
.
He
watched
her
as
she
went
past
at
a
walk
,
the
black
Labrador
and
he
both
gazing
wistfully
,
their
breath
steaming
in
the
cold
February
morning
.
He
waited
till
the
horses
were
well
away
and
looked
round
the
wide
,
flat
landscape
carefully
before
unclipping
the
lead
.
"
Way
you
go
,
Patty
,
"
he
said
softly
,
and
the
dog
was
off
,
hurling
herself
along
the
embankment
,
all
paws
and
flying
ears
,
after
a
rabbit
who
had
been
sitting
in
a
patch
of
sun
but
disappeared
with
contemptuous
ease
as
she
came
close
.
The
boy
had
been
told
unequivocally
not
to
let
her
off
the
lead
-
the
riding-school
only
used
the
land
by
grace
of
its
owner
and
it
was
a
shooting
estate
-
but
he
hated
keeping
the
dog
straining
at
the
lead
and
knew
that
she
would
always
come
to
his
call
.
He
stood
for
a
moment
laughing
at
her
as
she
cast
furiously
for
the
vanished
rabbit
,
and
walked
on
,
to
catch
her
up
,
along
the
raised
embankment
.
The
trees
had
grown
up
beside
it
in
the
twenty-five
years
since
the
railway
had
closed
,
and
the
boy
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
watch
small
birds
hopping
around
the
top
branches
.
He
particularly
liked
this
stretch
;
nothing
but
the
odd
tractor
and
the
horses
ever
came
down
this
embankment
,
and
the
birds
were
unworried
by
his
presence
.
After
half
a
mile
he
decided
to
turn
off
the
embankment
and
walk
up
the
side
of
the
next
field
and
along
the
path
at
the
top
of
it
,
following
the
horses
whom
he
could
still
see
in
the
distance
.
He
called
Patty
to
him
.
She
did
n't
come
,
which
was
surprising
;
she
was
a
docile
creature
and
particularly
devoted
to
him
because
he
always
took
her
for
a
walk
when
he
was
at
the
stables
.
He
could
hear
her
barking
and
looked
down
over
the
steep
side
of
the
embankment
to
the
bottom
of
the
trees
.
He
called
her
again
and
again
,
but
she
would
not
stop
barking
at
something
he
could
not
see
.
Probably
a
squirrel
,
he
decided
,
and
slithered
down
the
side
of
the
embankment
to
join
her
,
scolding
as
he
went
.
Straightening
up
beside
the
dog
,
he
looked
where
she
was
looking
,
and
blinked
.
He
saw
a
leg
,
uncomfortably
wedged
between
sapling
trees
,
swollen
grotesquely
,
and
gazed
at
it
,
stupidly
,
wondering
if
it
was
plastic
.
As
his
eyes
focused
he
realized
he
was
looking
at
a
hideously
swollen
human
body
,
and
just
then
,
as
the
light
breeze
shifted
,
he
caught
the
stomach-turning
odour
of
decay
.
He
was
a
sensible
and
capable
boy
,
an
eldest
child
,
so
he
moved
closer
,
trying
not
to
breathe
,
and
stood
steadfastly
looking
until
he
was
confident
of
what
he
had
seen
:
a
body
,
must
be
a
girl
because
it
was
wearing
a
skirt
,
lying
face
down
,
head
towards
the
bottom
of
the
embankment
as
if
she
had
dived
off
the
top
.
He
clipped
the
lead
on
to
the
dog
with
cold
hands
which
would
hardly
function
,
and
let
her
pull
him
up
the
slope
as
fast
as
he
could
make
his
legs
move
.
He
stopped
on
the
embankment
,
shaking
with
cold
and
shock
,
to
note
the
spot
,
then
fled
along
the
tractor
paths
,
the
dog
running
with
him
,
to
the
stables
where
the
ten
o'clock
children
's
ride
was
in
its
closing
stages
.
"
Miss
Williams
!
"
"
Jamie
,
I
'm
teaching
.
"
The
thin
,
capable
woman
who
was
taking
the
riding-class
looked
at
him
in
amazement
as
he
leaned
panting
on
the
gate
to
the
ring
,
the
dog
whining
beside
him
.
"
I
'm
sorry
.
Please
,
I
've
found
something
,
I
must
tell
you
.
She
had
known
him
since
he
was
a
very
small
five-year-old
,
perched
like
a
mosquito
on
one
of
the
placid
beginners
'
ponies
,
so
she
told
the
class
to
carry
on
walking
their
ponies
while
she
came
to
him
.
"
There
's
someone
dead
.
Below
the
railway
embankment
.
"
"
Are
you
sure
?
"
The
boy
looked
at
her
and
uncontrollable
tears
suddenly
filled
his
eyes
.
He
was
very
nearly
as
tall
as
her
,
but
she
put
an
arm
under
his
shoulders
and
supported
him
to
the
untidy
room
which
served
as
the
stable
office
,
calling
to
one
of
the
stable
girls
to
take
over
the
class
.
"
Patty
found
her
.
She
's
just
lying
there
,
but
she
is
dead
.
"
He
scrubbed
at
his
face
with
the
handkerchief
she
offered
and
gulped
for
air
.
"
I
'll
ring
the
police
.
"
She
did
so
,
casting
an
experienced
eye
over
him
.
"
Sit
down
here
,
Jamie
,
and
I
'll
make
some
tea
.
Mummy
will
come
back
in
a
few
minutes
,
wo
n't
she
,
for
Susie
?
"
"
Not
Mummy
.
Aunt
Margaret
is
coming
at
ten
.
"
The
boy
thought
longingly
of
his
mother
,
but
managed
to
help
Miss
Williams
describe
the
location
of
the
body
to
a
startled
local
station
sergeant
and
to
drink
a
cup
of
sweet
milky
tea
without
being
sick
.
By
the
time
his
aunt
arrived
Jamie
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
refuse
to
go
home
and
to
point
out
,
severely
,
that
he
would
be
needed
,
either
to
assist
the
police
or
to
be
lead
rider
in
the
eleven-thirty
class
,
or
possibly
both
.
He
watched
his
aunt
and
Miss
Williams
wordlessly
consult
each
other
,
but
knew
his
aunt
would
do
as
she
was
told
;
successful
solicitor
though
she
was
,
she
was
ten
years
younger
than
Miss
Williams
and
,
as
she
complained
,
totally
intimidated
by
her
as
she
had
not
been
by
anyone
since
her
late
headmistress
.
He
was
unsurprised
to
find
her
packed
off
firmly
to
take
his
sister
home
,
leaving
him
as
a
person
of
major
importance
in
what
he
instantly
assumed
to
be
a
real
murder
.
Miss
Williams
took
him
to
meet
the
police
Land
Rover
at
the
stable
gate
,
a
bone-thin
,
wiry
woman
in
her
late
fifties
,
her
expression
sufficiently
forbidding
to
prevent
the
parents
,
edging
cars
through
the
gate
to
collect
children
from
the
ten
o'clock
ride
,
from
asking
any
questions
.
Jamie
,
through
a
renewed
queasiness
,
just
observed
that
the
police
driver
was
instantly
reduced
to
half
his
age
by
Miss
Williams
's
greeting
.
"
He
was
one
of
my
boys
,
"
she
said
in
explanation
to
the
CID
sergeant
who
was
leading
the
party
as
they
bumped
over
the
rough
road
,
through
the
thick
mud
and
on
to
the
dry
embankment
.
"
Like
Jamie
here
.
"
"
Did
you
recognize
the
person
you
found
,
young
man
?
"
the
sergeant
asked
,
carefully
.
"
No
.
"
Tears
started
into
Jamie
's
eyes
.
"
She
was
all
swollen
.
"
The
sergeant
's
eyes
widened
,
and
he
slid
out
of
the
Land
Rover
and
stood
back
to
let
Jamie
out
.
"
Very
competent
boy
.
Almost
a
professional
singer
,
handles
himself
very
well
.
"
Miss
Williams
's
natural
pitch
,
well
suited
to
reaching
across
a
hunting-field
,
was
discreetly
reduced
.
The
CID
sergeant
thanked
her
gravely
and
went
to
stand
beside
Jamie
who
was
peering
down
the
embankment
,
looking
pinched
.
"
We
'll
go
down
together
,
lad
.
"
"
There
is
n't
room
.
I
'll
lead
.
"
He
took
a
deep
breath
and
headed
down
,
the
sergeant
,
two
constables
and
Miss
Williams
in
his
wake
.
Soon
they
all
stood
side
by
side
,
one
of
the
younger
policemen
coughing
involuntarily
.
"
Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
,
"
Miss
Williams
said
on
an
indrawn
breath
.
"
Sorry
.
Come
along
,
Jamie
,
let's
get
you
back
.
"
She
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
mopped
her
eyes
.
The
police
driver
shot
Jamie
a
look
of
enquiry
which
he
missed
,
occupied
as
he
was
with
guiding
Miss
Williams
back
up
the
hill
.
He
had
seen
her
weep
before
but
only
for
a
sick
horse
,
and
he
was
awe-struck
.
"
Jamie
,
did
you
let
Patty
off
the
lead
?
"
The
boy
blushed
to
his
ears
and
owned
to
it
.
"
You
must
not
do
it
,
Jamie
,
we
'll
be
in
trouble
with
Colonel
James
,
I
've
told
all
you
boys
a
thousand
times
.
"
"
He
'll
perhaps
not
do
it
again
,
"
the
sergeant
murmured
,
and
received
the
look
that
Miss
Williams
habitually
bent
on
a
child
who
was
riding
carelessly
.
"
How
long
had
she
been
there
?
"
Jamie
asked
,
anxiously
.
"
A
few
days
,
"
the
sergeant
said
,
grimly
.
"
How
many
?
"
"
Doctor
'll
tell
us
.
"
He
considered
the
boy
thoughtfully
,
and
decided
to
take
him
back
quickly
.
These
teenagers
were
in
his
experience
a
lot
less
tough
than
they
looked
.
"
Any
idea
who
it
could
be
?
"
he
asked
Miss
Williams
casually
.
"
No
.
But
only
a
local
would
know
to
put
a
body
there
.
If
Jamie
had
n't
let
the
dog
off
the
lead
she
could
have
been
there
much
longer
.
"
The
sergeant
nodded
,
deciding
it
could
do
no
harm
to
concede
a
point
he
had
already
taken
.
"
No
one
could
tell
who
she
was
,
surely
?
"
Miss
Williams
said
quietly
to
him
,
sounding
shaky
.
"
She
did
n't
even
look
human
.
"
The
sergeant
confirmed
that
that
happened
with
bodies
after
a
few
days
.
"
We
'll
identify
her
,
though
,
"
he
said
,
reassuringly
.
"
Somebody
will
likely
have
reported
her
missing
.
"
He
stopped
,
abruptly
,
as
he
remembered
a
conversation
earlier
that
week
,
and
lit
a
cigarette
,
thinking
furiously
.
This
could
be
the
girl
whom
the
Yard
were
looking
for
,
and
he
had
better
do
everything
very
quickly
indeed
,
including
finding
his
Chief
,
who
would
then
want
to
find
his
Chief
Constable
and
notify
Scotland
Yard
.
Presumably
it
would
be
the
Yard
who
investigated
this
one
,
rather
than
the
regional
crime
squad
.
He
chewed
his
thumbnail
as
he
walked
,
out
of
long
experience
keeping
in
mind
the
highest
priorities
:
Ensure
Body
Not
Moved
and
Ensure
Next
of
Kin
Notified
before
the
Press
got
the
story
.
He
posted
the
detective
constable
he
had
with
him
back
down
the
path
to
join
his
colleague
,
armed
with
instructions
to
repel
all
attempts
by
anyone
,
however
senior
or
armed
with
whatever
authority
,
to
go
anywhere
near
the
body
unless
he
,
Sergeant
Black
,
personally
accompanied
them
.
Then
he
climbed
into
the
Land
Rover
beside
his
two
passengers
and
drove
off
fast
,
with
the
aim
of
abandoning
Jamie
to
the
custody
of
his
aunt
as
quickly
as
possible
.
He
could
see
with
half
an
eye
that
the
kid
's
aunt
was
going
to
be
one
of
the
confident
,
bossy
,
well-connected
women
with
whom
that
part
of
Cambridgeshire
was
substantially
over-provided
.
John
McLeish
was
in
his
office
,
Saturday
or
no
Saturday
,
telling
himself
he
needed
to
catch
up
on
the
paperwork
.
The
phone
rang
and
he
picked
it
up
,
frowning
.
One
of
the
pleasures
of
Saturday
working
was
that
the
phone
did
not
ring
all
the
time
.
The
voice
at
the
other
end
was
plainly
over-excited
and
it
took
him
a
minute
to
disentangle
what
he
was
being
told
.
"
Oh
congratulations
,
Charlie
.
Sorry
,
what
did
you
say
it
was
again
?
"
"
A
little
girl
.
Actually
a
very
big
girl
as
these
things
go
,
nine
pounds
.
It
's
fantastic
,
John
,
there
she
is
,
a
new
person
,
lying
on
her
face
,
sound
asleep
.
I
've
just
left
them
and
I
'm
going
back
.
"
McLeish
repressed
the
malicious
thought
that
this
event
might
put
Francesca
's
nose
just
a
little
bit
out
of
joint
.
She
had
been
utterly
secure
in
her
position
as
the
only
girl
in
the
Wilson
family
and
now
there
was
another
one
.
"
I
've
got
another
bit
of
good
news
.
Frannie
's
going
to
be
able
to
bring
Tristram
home
pretty
soon
,
apparently
.
"
McLeish
expressed
qualified
enthusiasm
and
Charlie
assured
him
he
felt
exactly
the
same
about
his
younger
brother
.
"
The
difficulty
is
that
Perry
does
everything
that
bit
better
than
Tristram
.
Not
that
this
is
any
excuse
,
John
,
I
do
know
.
"
He
paused
,
reminding
McLeish
irresistibly
of
a
Labrador
wondering
how
best
to
approach
an
acquaintance
.
"
I
wanted
to
say
,
you
see
,
that
I
know
you
thought
Frannie
should
n't
have
gone
,
and
that
it
's
ruined
your
holiday
plans
,
and
,
on
behalf
of
us
all
,
I
'm
sorry
.
I
know
the
little
boys
lean
on
her
too
much
and
I
would
have
gone
if
I
could
.
"
He
coughed
,
embarrassed
and
a
little
pompous
,
very
much
conscious
of
his
new
status
as
a
father
,
while
McLeish
remembered
that
he
was
a
scant
four
years
older
than
the
delinquent
Tristram
.
"
Anyway
she
should
be
back
soon
,
"
Charlie
concluded
.
McLeish
thanked
him
gravely
,
feeling
,
as
he
often
did
with
the
Wilsons
,
that
he
was
being
enveloped
in
a
large
feather
eiderdown
,
and
,
made
restless
by
the
call
,
went
down
the
corridor
to
where
he
knew
Catherine
Crane
was
also
in
,
getting
her
office
in
order
.
He
stopped
at
the
door
and
smiled
at
her
.
Wearing
jeans
and
a
blue
shirt
,
she
was
tugging
at
a
filing
cabinet
which
was
too
large
for
her
to
embrace
and
which
was
threatening
to
over-balance
on
her
.
She
looked
about
sixteen
and
beautiful
.
She
let
go
of
the
cabinet
,
coughing
in
the
dust
of
ages
that
appeared
to
be
lurking
behind
it
,
and
smiled
back
at
him
as
the
February
sun
shone
through
the
small
window
behind
her
,
throwing
into
sharp
relief
the
patches
on
the
wall
where
her
predecessor
had
hung
posters
,
and
the
ingrained
dirt
on
the
flaking
paintwork
round
the
mean
,
narrow
,
metal
window
.
"
Where
do
you
want
that
put
?
"
McLeish
advanced
on
the
cabinet
and
shifted
it
authoritatively
,
ignoring
the
clip
on
the
ankle
dealt
him
by
an
unsecured
bottom
drawer
apparently
full
of
bricks
.
"
I
should
have
unloaded
it
first
,
"
Catherine
Crane
said
,
apologetically
,
"
but
I
just
could
n't
move
in
any
direction
with
it
where
it
was
.
"
"
I
'm
here
,
just
tell
me
if
you
want
anything
else
shifted
.
"
He
hesitated
.
"
I
'm
going
to
do
another
hour
,
then
have
some
lunch
,
if
you
want
to
come
?
"
He
was
aware
that
he
was
not
managing
to
sound
exactly
like
a
senior
officer
making
a
recent
arrival
feel
at
home
,
but
decided
not
to
add
any
further
riders
to
his
invitation
.
"
That
would
be
very
nice
.
Are
we
going
to
the
canteen
?
"
"
Not
if
I
can
help
it
.
What
about
the
pub
?
"
If
I
'm
allowed
to
buy
my
own
.
"
McLeish
considered
.
"
That
's
fine
on
the
food
-
I
'll
buy
the
drinks
,
I
'm
too
old
to
get
used
to
women
buying
my
drinks
.
"
She
laughed
at
him
and
said
gravely
that
she
would
be
happy
to
indulge
him
,
and
he
went
away
,
grinning
.
Peter
Yeo
was
also
in
his
office
,
having
told
his
wife
he
was
lunching
with
a
client
.
It
was
,
he
felt
,
just
too
difficult
to
be
at
home
at
all
,
with
Claudia
in
a
permanently
bitchy
mood
and
both
his
teenage
children
taking
their
cue
from
her
and
behaving
intolerably
.
He
wandered
restlessly
about
,
and
decided
that
the
lie
might
as
well
become
the
truth
.
Without
Angela
Morgan
,
at
least
two
major
clients
were
in
danger
of
not
getting
the
assiduous
service
they
were
paying
for
,
and
it
would
be
well
worth
trying
to
see
if
one
of
them
,
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
fellow
refugee
from
family
life
at
the
weekends
,
could
be
found
.
He
was
in
luck
,
and
fixed
to
meet
Andy
Barton
at
Brazzo
's
where
Yeo
Davis
had
a
table
permanently
booked
.
He
had
to
admit
that
this
particular
client
hardly
added
to
the
general
decorative
smartness
of
the
place
.
Andy
Barton
,
founder
and
chief
executive
of
Barton
Textiles
,
was
almost
as
broad
as
he
was
long
,
virtually
neckless
,
with
incongruously
long
brown
hair
curling
over
his
collar
.
His
enormous
hands
dwarfed
the
elegant
menu
which
he
was
studying
in
apparent
disbelief
,
and
Peter
Yeo
noticed
again
,
as
Barton
without
rising
extended
one
massive
paw
,
that
though
the
fingers
were
an
ordinary
length
it
was
the
width
of
the
palms
that
made
the
hands
so
large
.
"
I
never
see
how
they
get
the
sales
per
square
foot
in
these
places
,
"
Barton
observed
,
without
further
greeting
.
"
I
mean
,
they
're
not
open
twelve
hours
like
my
shops
,
and
they
are
n't
using
the
space
.
"
His
small
bright
blue
eyes
swept
disparagingly
over
the
minimalized
black
and
white
flooring
,
stainless
steel
chairs
and
black
wooden
bar
.
"
They
make
a
huge
margin
on
a
smaller
turnover
,
Andy
,
out
of
punters
like
us
.
"
Peter
Yeo
was
amused
by
,
and
respectful
of
,
a
man
with
an
obsession
.
"
Angela
not
working
today
?
"
Barton
worked
a
sixteen-hour
day
,
which
began
with
careful
,
detailed
consideration
of
the
trading
figures
and
key
ratios
for
every
one
of
his
forty-three
major
shops
and
the
output
of
both
factories
,
and
continued
,
usually
by
helicopter
,
with
a
detailed
aerial
survey
of
a
particular
area
as
the
quick
way
of
identifying
new
sites
,
interspersed
with
unheralded
descents
on
the
manager
of
any
shop
he
took
a
fancy
to
visit
.
Peter
Yeo
,
who
had
known
this
particular
juggernaut
since
he
had
his
first
small
factory
and
two
stores
and
dirt
under
his
fingernails
from
shifting
packing-cases
personally
,
was
not
fazed
by
the
question
.
"
Angela
's
taking
a
few
days
off
-
she
has
n't
been
well
,
"
he
said
,
easily
.
"
I
know
she
's
been
working
very
hard
for
you
.
I
'm
up
to
speed
with
Huerter
,
of
course
,
but
is
your
planning
application
in
Leicester
all
right
?
"
Barton
assured
him
warmly
that
Angela
had
done
a
great
job
and
he
was
now
confident
of
getting
planning
permission
on
the
vast
site
he
had
wanted
.
Peter
Yeo
,
who
knew
him
in
this
over-candid
,
over-emphatic
mood
,
decided
to
prod
gently
.
"
Angela
said
the
council
wanted
it
for
housing
?
"
"
Yeah
,
some
of
them
did
.
Silly
buggers
,
it
's
jobs
they
want
there
first
.
Plenty
of
housing
if
those
stupid
farts
at
the
council
got
round
to
repairing
it
and
stopped
their
tenants
tearing
apart
what
they
have
got
.
My
Mum
brought
up
five
of
us
in
a
flat
far
worse
than
what
these
immigrants
complain
about
.
"
Peter
Yeo
,
who
had
personally
persuaded
Barton
of
the
presentational
disadvantage
of
using
words
like
"
darkies
"
,
"
niggers
"
or
"
wogs
"
,
decided
that
"
immigrants
"
even
though
used
in
the
manner
of
one
invoking
a
curse
,
was
as
good
as
he
was
going
to
get
with
this
particular
client
.
"
She
's
doing
a
good
job
on
sorting
this
Huerter
thing
,
too
.
Bloody
ridiculous
them
blokes
at
the
DTI
pushing
assistance
for
Huerter
.
I
voted
for
this
government
because
they
said
they
were
n't
going
to
go
in
for
that
sort
of
rubbish
.
No
one
ever
gave
me
anything
and
my
business
works
.
Still
,
Angie
can
fix
the
Treasury
on
this
one
,
given
her
boyfriend
,
ca
n't
she
?
That
's
the
reason
I
wanted
you
on
this
.
"
Peter
Yeo
winced
inwardly
,
but
he
was
not
going
to
tell
Andy
Barton
that
Angela
was
missing
,
or
express
any
of
his
reservations
about
how
much
influence
Angela
could
bring
to
bear
.
He
smoothly
changed
the
subject
to
the
looks
of
the
blond
model
,
three
tables
away
,
and
Barton
agreed
he
would
n't
mind
a
bit
of
that
;
on
the
thin
side
,
mind
you
,
but
tasty
.
The
rest
of
lunch
passed
in
similar
diversion
,
interspersed
with
details
of
last
week
's
turnover
which
were
never
far
from
Barton
's
mind
,
whatever
other
distractions
offered
.
Mrs
Huntley
was
having
lunch
with
her
daughter
.
She
ate
placidly
,
acknowledging
to
herself
with
her
customary
good
sense
that
at
the
moment
,
as
at
any
time
since
her
brother
William
had
died
,
she
and
Penelope
were
getting
no
pleasure
at
all
from
each
other
's
company
.
Penelope
was
looking
particularly
discontented
and
disaffected
,
picking
at
her
food
.
Her
red
suit
was
smart
,
but
too
bright
a
colour
for
her
pale
English
pink
and
white
skin
,
her
brown
hair
could
have
done
with
a
wash
and
her
nails
were
ragged
and
bitten
.
She
was
frowning
,
deep
lines
appearing
between
her
eyebrows
,
mouth
drawn
down
at
the
edges
so
that
instead
of
a
classically
good-looking
slim
English
Rose
in
her
late
twenties
,
she
looked
faded
,
years
older
than
her
real
age
,
and
shrewish
.
Mrs
Huntley
sighed
;
her
brother
whom
she
had
loved
,
but
knew
to
be
self-indulgent
to
a
fault
,
had
done
his
niece
real
harm
by
leaving
so
much
of
his
money
away
from
the
girl
who
had
confidently
believed
herself
to
be
his
favourite
thing
on
earth
.
Penelope
,
however
,
it
had
to
be
acknowledged
,
had
made
no
attempt
to
rise
above
the
blow
she
had
been
dealt
by
finding
a
dazzling
girl
of
her
own
age
favoured
over
herself
in
her
uncle
's
will
.
At
least
,
Mrs
Huntley
thought
hopefully
,
she
had
stopped
wondering
,
unbecomingly
and
stridently
,
how
her
uncle
could
have
been
fooled
by
Angela
Morgan
.
It
was
Grizel
Huntley
's
own
view
that
her
brother
had
not
been
fooled
at
all
but
had
been
charmed
and
diverted
by
a
dashing
girl
thirty
years
his
junior
,
and
had
seen
no
reason
at
all
why
she
should
not
have
a
share
of
his
considerable
estate
when
that
left
a
very
decent
down-setting
for
his
niece
as
well
.
Indeed
,
she
had
respected
Angela
Morgan
for
the
straightforwardness
with
which
she
had
tackled
the
issue
when
they
had
met
at
the
lawyer
's
office
.
"
I
'm
sorry
you
're
disappointed
,
"
she
had
said
to
Penelope
,
"
but
after
all
there
's
a
lot
of
money
,
quite
enough
for
both
of
us
.
"
So
there
was
,
Grizel
Huntley
acknowledged
,
and
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
if
Penny
could
manage
to
think
a
bit
more
positively
.
"
If
she
has
vanished
,
I
'm
going
to
see
that
solicitor
about
whether
I
can
get
her
presumed
dead
.
"
Penny
,
sounding
childishly
,
sullenly
determined
,
broke
into
her
mother
's
thoughts
.
Grizel
Huntley
looked
across
at
her
,
shocked
.
"
I
would
wait
a
little
if
I
were
you
.
"
Penelope
glared
at
her
,
turning
an
ungraceful
scarlet
,
but
Mrs
Huntley
held
her
ground
.
"
You
are
being
silly
about
this
,
Penny
.
You
are
letting
this
disappointment
-
and
that
's
all
it
is
,
you
're
still
a
very
well-off
young
woman
-
get
in
the
way
of
everything
.
"
Penelope
choked
on
her
pudding
and
started
to
cry
,
angry
,
uncontrollable
tears
.
Grizel
Huntley
reached
out
to
comfort
her
but
she
forced
back
her
chair
and
fled
,
clutching
her
handbag
and
napkin
,
leaving
her
mother
with
the
ruins
of
lunch
.
Fifty
miles
north
,
Sarah
Morgan
had
just
finished
serving
a
lunch
that
no
one
had
done
more
than
pick
at
.
Her
husband
Francis
had
made
a
slightly
better
showing
than
her
daughter
Jennifer
,
who
was
looking
particularly
ragged
.
Mother
and
daughter
were
very
like
each
other
,
tall
,
dark
,
slim
,
pleasant-looking
women
with
mid-brown
curly
hair
and
slightly
snub
noses
.
Francis
Morgan
,
by
contrast
,
was
dark
,
almost
black-haired
,
sallow-skinned
,
with
bright
brown
eyes
.
Of
medium
height
and
packed
with
energy
,
even
distressed
as
he
was
,
he
was
bursting
round
the
kitchen
,
hair
still
damp
at
the
back
from
his
swim
.
"
Let's
go
to
the
flicks
.
No
point
at
all
sitting
round
looking
at
each
other
.
Come
on
Jennifer
-
or
are
you
going
out
with
Michael
?
"
"
He
's
gone
back
to
Australia
,
Dad
.
Last
week
.
"
Jennifer
sounded
defeated
,
and
he
looked
at
her
sideways
with
familiar
love
and
exasperation
.
She
just
did
n't
seem
to
be
able
to
hang
on
to
men
,
he
thought
impatiently
,
not
like
his
Angie
,
wherever
she
was
.
"
Giles
rang
up
,
"
his
daughter
volunteered
,
and
he
was
uncomfortably
reminded
by
something
in
her
voice
that
Giles
Hawick
was
one
of
the
men
Jennifer
had
n't
been
able
to
hang
on
to
-
or
not
once
he
had
seen
Angela
.
"
How
was
he
?
"
his
wife
Sarah
asked
,
rather
too
quickly
.
"
Well
,
very
worried
.
He
said
the
police
were
talking
to
everyone
Angie
had
seen
in
the
two
weeks
before
she
-
well
-
vanished
,
and
so
far
had
come
up
with
nothing
.
I
mean
no
one
noticed
anything
unusual
about
her
and
she
seemed
to
be
full
of
plans
for
the
wedding
.
"
"
Well
,
I
told
them
that
,
"
Francis
Morgan
said
irritably
and
his
wife
and
daughter
caught
each
other
's
eye
in
silent
agreement
that
he
had
n't
told
them
that
Angela
was
refusing
point-black
to
be
married
from
home
and
was
insisting
on
the
full
London
set-out
,
reception
at
the
House
of
Commons
,
replying
unanswerably
when
he
had
objected
on
grounds
of
expense
that
she
could
well
afford
to
pay
for
it
herself
.
A
row
of
epic
proportions
had
ensued
,
which
he
and
Angela
had
evidently
enjoyed
but
which
had
left
Sarah
and
Jennifer
sick
with
distress
.
"
I
do
n't
want
to
go
out
,
Frank
.
Someone
might
ring
.
"
Sarah
Morgan
was
sounding
diffident
but
resolute
,
and
as
Morgan
opened
his
mouth
to
protest
in
exasperation
the
doorbell
rang
.
Both
women
looked
at
him
in
joint
appeal
and
he
marched
to
the
door
,
pulling
it
open
with
unnecessary
force
.
He
stood
,
door
in
hand
,
checked
by
something
in
the
way
his
visitors
,
a
man
and
a
woman
,
were
standing
.
The
man
,
a
stocky
,
greying
fifty-year-old
in
a
navy
raincoat
over
a
suit
,
his
hair
cut
short
,
was
attended
by
a
uniformed
policewoman
,
hair
smartly
set
under
the
cap
,
her
eyes
watchful
in
the
wide
,
flat
,
placid
face
,
and
both
of
them
were
standing
square
and
stolid
.
Francis
Morgan
stood
and
stared
at
them
,
and
even
before
the
man
stepped
forward
steadily
,
hand
extended
,
mouth
opening
to
speak
,
he
understood
who
they
were
and
what
they
had
come
to
tell
him
.
"
Catherine
.
"
John
McLeish
,
looking
even
bigger
than
usual
,
appeared
in
her
office
.
"
The
Cambridgeshire
police
think
they
have
found
Angela
Morgan
.
They
've
got
a
body
of
about
the
right
description
and
they
've
gone
to
see
Miss
Morgan
's
parents
.
We
need
to
hurry
but
it
'll
take
an
hour
or
so
and
I
do
n't
want
the
papers
on
to
it
before
the
next
of
kin
know
.
You
got
your
kit
?
"
Catherine
Crane
wordlessly
pointed
to
the
back
of
the
door
of
her
office
on
which
hung
a
neat
suit
.
He
looked
round
,
and
realized
she
had
cleaned
the
whole
office
in
the
hour
and
a
half
since
he
had
seen
her
.
"
Looks
a
lot
better
.
And
only
just
in
time
.
Meet
you
in
ten
minutes
.
I
've
got
to
change
,
then
we
're
on
our
way
.
Sorry
about
lunch
,
we
'll
get
a
sandwich
.
"
"
I
'm
sorry
,
Mr
Morgan
,
but
we
ca
n't
move
the
body
yet
.
There
is
a
senior
officer
from
Scotland
Yard
on
his
way
,
and
our
people
,
photographers
and
so
on
.
"
"
If
it
's
my
daughter
I
want
to
see
her
now
,
I
do
n't
want
to
wait
.
"
"
I
'm
sorry
,
sir
.
"
Francis
Morgan
subsided
abruptly
on
one
of
the
uncomfortable
chesterfields
in
the
sunny
,
cramped
,
living-room
and
Detective
Inspector
Teversham
shifted
uncomfortably
,
wishing
the
phone
call
would
come
.
The
phone
rang
.
He
sprang
to
it
,
and
collected
instructions
in
a
room
silent
except
for
the
sound
of
Mrs
Morgan
weeping
drearily
into
her
handkerchief
.
With
one
part
of
his
mind
he
logged
the
fact
that
Mum
had
understood
the
worst
immediately
and
must
in
some
way
have
been
expecting
it
.
The
deceased
had
been
Daddy
's
girl
,
then
-
although
it
was
usually
the
dads
,
where
a
daughter
was
in
question
,
who
fought
against
the
realization
of
the
truth
.
His
WPC
was
looking
at
him
anxiously
for
guidance
,
but
he
shook
his
head
at
her
slightly
and
waited
,
standing
squarely
on
both
feet
as
he
had
done
in
many
trying
circumstances
before
.
"
I
'll
come
with
you
.
Sarah
and
Jennifer
,
you
stay
here
.
"
Mrs
Morgan
made
a
movement
of
protest
but
Francis
Morgan
looked
to
Teversham
for
support
.
"
I
think
that
would
be
better
,
yes
,
sir
,
"
he
agreed
.
"
I
must
see
her
.
"
Sarah
Morgan
emerged
from
her
handkerchief
.
"
Do
n't
be
silly
Sarah
,
it
might
not
be
Angela
,
"
Francis
Morgan
said
,
desperately
.
"
Sergeant
Jennings
here
will
make
some
tea
,
then
she
'll
stay
with
you
while
Mr
Morgan
and
I
go
over
to
the
stables
.
We
'll
be
back
inside
the
hour
.
Perhaps
we
could
have
a
cup
now
?
"
He
watched
,
stolidly
,
as
Mrs
Morgan
disappeared
to
the
kitchen
to
show
the
sergeant
what
was
what
and
considered
,
without
watching
her
,
the
other
Miss
Morgan
.
She
was
n't
crying
her
eyes
out
.
She
was
pale
,
but
not
as
shocked
as
she
might
have
been
.
Well
,
that
was
all
right
-
she
could
look
after
Mum
in
the
hour
that
was
to
follow
while
the
identity
of
the
body
was
established
,
and
in
all
the
grim
hours
after
that
,
if
the
body
was
her
sister
.
He
gently
insisted
that
Francis
Morgan
got
a
cup
of
tea
,
with
sugar
,
down
him
before
he
escorted
him
out
to
the
waiting
car
.
He
sat
in
the
back
with
him
,
for
company
,
and
chatted
soothingly
of
nothing
as
the
driver
did
the
eight
miles
or
so
to
Kirton
,
and
swept
into
the
riding-school
yard
.
Evidently
a
class
had
just
finished
and
the
place
was
boiling
with
ponies
,
small
children
,
pink-faced
with
exertion
in
oversized
helmets
covered
with
bright
silks
,
parents
urging
them
to
hurry
up
and
get
in
cars
,
and
teenage
girls
bulging
out
of
light
jodhpurs
organizing
the
whole
.
A
still
point
in
this
maelstrom
was
Sergeant
Black
,
who
had
tucked
himself
between
two
of
the
sheltering
twelve-foot
evergreens
planted
to
cut
off
the
east
wind
from
the
ring
.
The
man
moved
efficiently
past
a
child
who
had
succeeded
in
entangling
her
pony
's
reins
with
her
feet
and
who
was
being
blasted
for
it
by
a
girl
who
could
n't
have
been
more
than
sixteen
,
but
was
sounding
like
a
woman
three
times
her
age
.
Precisely
who
it
was
she
was
using
for
a
role
model
became
clear
as
a
middle-aged
lady
,
admirably
slim
in
well-cut
jodhpurs
,
erupted
from
some
inner
fortress
to
enquire
,
in
tones
that
carried
effortlessly
across
the
yard
,
precisely
why
Caroline
had
failed
to
run
up
her
stirrups
,
how
long
had
she
been
riding
?
The
tone
was
uncompromising
but
somehow
neutral
,
and
the
child
addressed
hastened
to
make
the
adjustment
,
rebuked
but
not
embarrassed
or
crushed
.
Teversham
stopped
where
he
was
,
saw
Miss
Williams
notice
him
,
and
waited
patiently
while
she
dispatched
four
of
the
assorted
teenagers
to
a
distant
meadow
with
eight
ponies
,
and
while
the
yard
cleared
of
small
children
and
their
parents
.
"
Miss
Williams
?
Detective
Inspector
Teversham
.
Mr
Morgan
is
in
my
car
over
there
.
"
"
I
'll
just
have
a
word
with
him
,
Chief
Inspector
.
I
used
to
know
him
well
.
"
She
was
white-faced
but
determined
and
the
policemen
stood
back
as
she
walked
over
towards
the
car
.
"
Decent
of
her
,
"
Teversham
observed
,
without
moving
his
lips
.
"
Hang
on
a
minute
,
who
's
this
?
"
A
grey
car
,
immaculately
clean
,
was
just
pulling
up
at
the
gate
and
a
big
man
in
a
plain
grey
suit
was
getting
out
to
open
it
.
"
Must
be
the
Yard
,
"
his
sergeant
observed
.
"
The
bloke
might
be
.
But
who
is
the
popsy
with
him
?
"
Teversham
's
terms
for
pretty
women
had
been
taken
wholesale
from
his
father
who
had
been
a
young
airman
in
World
War
II
.
The
car
drew
up
alongside
them
,
McLeish
having
known
them
as
policemen
by
the
same
process
as
they
had
recognized
him
.
"
Chief
Inspector
John
McLeish
.
"
He
flapped
his
warrant
card
in
automatic
greeting
and
waved
a
hand
at
Catherine
who
had
also
got
out
of
the
car
.
"
Detective
Sergeant
Crane
.
"
He
watched
amused
as
both
the
Cambridge
detectives
shook
hands
gingerly
,
obviously
taken
aback
.
"
Father
of
the
missing
girl
over
there
,
talking
to
the
good
lady
who
runs
this
establishment
and
who
has
already
seen
the
body
.
There
's
a
man
of
mine
on
the
spot
.
We
think
it
's
probably
your
girl
-
the
ring
on
the
finger
fits
the
description
and
her
parents
are
local
.
"
John
McLeish
considered
this
admirably
succinct
report
and
decided
the
competent
bloke
was
bound
to
resent
Scotland
Yard
intrusion
.
"
If
this
turns
out
to
be
the
lady
we
're
looking
for
,
she
was
engaged
to
a
Treasury
Minister
,
who
called
in
my
guv'nor
.
"
"
Oh
,
rather
you
than
me
,
if
that
's
who
she
is
.
And
much
better
you
have
it
from
the
start
.
My
Super
's
already
got
his
knickers
in
a
twist
.
"
The
reply
was
prompt
and
ungrudging
and
McLeish
breathed
easier
.
It
was
no
fun
at
all
working
with
an
uncooperative
and
resentful
local
force
.
"
I
've
got
a
scene-of-crime
squad
coming
,
if
that
's
all
right
.
I
've
worked
with
them
before
,
you
see
,
"
he
added
,
in
explanation
and
Teversham
had
just
time
to
assure
him
he
well
understood
and
would
n't
himself
like
to
work
with
anyone
else
's
squad
,
before
Miss
Williams
,
tears
in
her
eyes
,
and
Francis
Morgan
,
white
with
distress
,
bore
down
on
them
.
John
McLeish
introduced
himself
and
Catherine
in
suitably
subdued
tones
.
Even
through
his
distress
,
Francis
Morgan
was
obviously
struck
by
Catherine
Crane
's
looks
and
as
the
party
distributed
itself
into
the
big
Land
Rover
he
managed
to
sit
next
to
her
.
McLeish
,
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
huddled
on
the
uncomfortable
bench-seating
,
could
smell
the
faint
perfume
she
wore
and
thought
,
with
what
detachment
he
could
bring
to
bear
,
that
one
of
the
minor
complications
of
this
case
was
going
to
be
the
reactions
of
every
man
involved
as
suspect
,
colleague
or
witness
,
to
this
beauty
he
had
managed
to
import
on
to
his
staff
.
The
Land
Rover
bumped
along
the
track
to
where
the
young
detective
constable
,
looking
chilled
and
ti
red
,
was
waiting
for
them
.
As
they
decanted
themselves
McLeish
managed
to
agree
quickly
with
Teversham
that
,
assuming
the
identification
was
confirmed
,
he
would
take
Francis
Morgan
and
Miss
Williams
back
,
leaving
Catherine
and
himself
at
the
site
.
He
waited
tactfully
with
Catherine
and
the
young
constable
on
the
embankment
,
liking
the
sweep
of
the
country
as
it
spread
out
in
the
raw
,
cold
day
.
"
Must
be
the
only
hill
between
here
and
Russia
,
"
he
observed
to
Catherine
who
pointed
out
it
was
n't
much
of
a
hill
,
more
a
fifty-foot
ridge
,
it
just
looked
high
in
this
dead
flat
plain
.
"
You
must
know
Cambridge
,
though
,
John
.
Your
girlfriend
studied
here
,
did
n't
she
?
"
"
I
did
n't
know
her
then
,
"
he
said
,
repressively
,
uneasily
conscious
that
he
had
given
Francesca
no
thought
at
all
that
day
and
did
n't
much
want
to
think
about
her
now
.
Catherine
Crane
fell
silent
,
and
he
fished
out
the
one-page
note
Teversham
had
handed
him
and
read
it
,
scowling
.
"
Good
God
,
"
he
said
,
involuntarily
,
and
Catherine
looked
at
him
enquiringly
.
"
I
know
the
boy
who
found
the
body
-
I
mean
it
must
be
him
.
He
lives
round
here
.
Jamie
Brett-Smith
.
He
's
a
child
star
-
a
singer
.
Did
the
theme
song
for
that
TV
thing
.
"
"
It
's
a
hymn
tune
.
My
Mum
has
it
-
I
do
n't
think
she
's
ever
bought
a
cassette
before
.
How
do
you
know
him
?
"
McLeish
hesitated
,
then
said
stiffly
that
he
was
Francesca
's
godson
,
and
also
something
like
her
third
cousin
,
or
his
mother
was
.
He
glanced
down
the
slope
and
realized
the
party
was
returning
.
Francis
Morgan
white-faced
and
dazed
,
Miss
Williams
supporting
his
elbow
,
equally
white
and
trying
not
to
cry
.
Teversham
,
at
Morgan
's
other
side
,
nodded
to
McLeish
in
confirmation
,
pro
forma
.
The
small
group
struggled
up
the
last
piece
of
the
embankment
,
Teversham
necessarily
in
the
rear
and
Francis
Morgan
stumbled
almost
on
to
McLeish
's
feet
.
McLeish
reached
out
to
steady
him
and
the
man
looked
up
at
him
,
unseeingly
.
"
Christ
.
Thirty
years
,
and
it
's
all
gone
.
That
's
my
Angie
.
It
's
her
ring
and
I
bought
her
that
scarf
.
"
"
I
'm
very
sorry
.
"
Francis
Morgan
looked
at
him
wildly
as
Teversham
came
up
at
his
elbow
,
solid
as
a
rock
.
"
It
's
your
job
now
,
is
it
?
"
he
asked
,
earnestly
.
"
You
'll
catch
the
bastard
who
did
it
.
"
"
We
'll
try
,
sir
.
"
Francis
Morgan
looked
from
him
to
Catherine
Crane
,
obviously
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
doing
,
in
an
agony
of
loss
.
"
How
old
are
you
,
Sergeant
?
"
he
asked
,
abruptly
.
"
Twenty-seven
,
sir
.
"
"
Almost
the
same
age
as
her
-
Angie
,
I
mean
.
"
The
bright
brown
eyes
rested
on
her
and
you
could
see
written
all
over
his
face
the
jealousy
that
this
girl
,
daughter
to
some
man
,
was
still
alive
while
his
child
was
gone
.
Teversham
and
his
sergeant
closed
round
Morgan
,
shepherding
him
to
the
waiting
Land
Rover
with
meaningless
gentle
instructions
to
watch
the
step
,
up
you
go
now
.
McLeish
glanced
up
the
track
to
see
,
in
the
distance
,
another
Land
Rover
swaying
over
the
rough
bits
,
and
touched
Teversham
's
elbow
.
"
That
's
my
lot
,
I
think
.
"
Teversham
nodded
in
acknowledgement
.
"
Miss
Williams
,
we
'll
find
the
road
again
if
we
go
straight
and
turn
left
by
the
hedge
,
wo
n't
we
?
"
"
Do
n't
do
that
,
"
McLeish
said
urgently
.
"
Sorry
,
but
if
there
was
a
vehicle
involved
it
probably
came
from
there
.
No
tracks
on
this
side
,
except
ours
.
"
"
Damn
.
"
Teversham
was
unnerved
by
the
nearness
of
the
following
Land
Rover
and
irritated
with
himself
for
missing
an
elementary
point
.
In
the
end
it
took
ten
minutes
to
get
the
Cambridgeshire
police
Land
Rover
turned
past
McLeish
's
squad
and
their
vans
,
and
away
back
up
to
the
stable
.
Teversham
had
agreed
to
call
the
AC
at
the
yard
and
report
that
the
identification
had
been
confirmed
,
so
that
he
could
go
and
see
Giles
Hawick
.
Francis
Morgan
would
no
doubt
ring
him
too
,
but
he
was
naturally
so
shaken
that
McLeish
thought
that
small
piece
of
insurance
worthwhile
.
He
watched
them
out
of
sight
,
then
turned
to
his
squad
.
"
Right
,
down
we
go
.
The
corpse
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
.
Young
woman
,
aged
twenty-nine
,
dead
about
a
week
the
local
bloke
reckons
.
"
He
glanced
down
the
slope
wishing
he
had
brought
boots
;
his
shoes
were
already
letting
in
mud
.
He
looked
at
Catherine
Crane
's
feet
and
saw
she
was
in
a
similar
situation
.
The
sergeant
from
the
scene
of
crime
squad
pushed
past
him
,
and
advanced
on
Catherine
Crane
,
holding
out
a
pair
of
battered
wellingtons
with
the
air
of
the
prince
hopefully
extending
a
glass
slipper
.
"
They
'll
be
too
big
,
Sergeant
,
but
maybe
better
than
your
shoes
?
We
have
some
spare
socks
,
too
.
"
McLeish
watched
her
melting
smile
,
as
did
every
man
in
the
group
.
"
Got
anything
there
to
fit
me
?
"
he
asked
pointedly
,
and
a
young
constable
reluctantly
transferred
his
attention
.
Kitted
up
some
five
minutes
later
with
a
pair
a
good
size
too
small
and
with
a
hole
in
the
right
toe
,
McLeish
led
his
troops
into
action
.
The
smell
hit
them
as
they
slithered
to
the
bottom
of
the
slope
and
McLeish
resolutely
took
a
breath
before
walking
over
to
where
the
swollen
body
lay
.
It
was
,
as
usual
,
not
the
person
who
lay
dead
but
the
shell
in
which
the
person
had
lived
.
The
girl
that
was
Angela
Morgan
had
looked
out
of
the
photograph
,
whereas
what
lay
on
the
ground
,
arms
outstretched
,
could
have
been
any
young
woman
with
dark
hair
.
The
well-defined
features
of
the
photograph
had
vanished
,
the
face
had
swollen
in
death
as
had
the
exposed
arms
.
Thank
God
it
was
n't
high
summer
,
McLeish
thought
,
stepping
back
almost
on
to
Catherine
's
toes
and
reaching
for
his
handkerchief
;
the
cold
,
particularly
at
night
,
would
have
retarded
decay
.
The
girl
had
been
missing
for
what
-
a
week
?
-
and
off-hand
he
agreed
with
the
local
man
's
judgement
that
she
had
been
here
for
most
of
it
.
The
sapling
trees
had
grown
tall
in
the
twenty-five
years
since
the
Beeching
axe
had
fallen
on
the
single
railway
track
,
and
,
even
leafless
as
they
were
,
they
effectively
screened
the
view
from
the
top
.
A
thick
hedge
shielded
her
from
the
field
which
swept
down
towards
the
foot
of
the
embankment
.
Whoever
had
brought
her
here
must
have
known
the
place
;
you
could
n't
have
picked
it
out
in
a
hurry
.
The
country
is
not
as
deserted
as
all
that
,
as
McLeish
,
brought
up
in
a
village
in
Leicestershire
,
well
knew
.
There
are
always
people
about
,
in
tractors
,
walking
or
riding
;
there
is
always
an
inquisitive
dog
.
He
stopped
at
this
thought
,
wondering
if
dogs
came
along
here
frequently
.
"
Careful
round
the
body
,
"
he
said
unnecessarily
to
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
squad
,
who
was
matter-of-factly
distributing
heavy-duty
surgical
masks
.
He
looked
round
for
Catherine
and
found
she
had
vanished
.
"
Back
that
way
,
sir
,
"
one
of
the
squad
volunteered
,
barely
intelligible
through
his
mask
,
and
McLeish
saw
her
,
twenty
yards
away
,
walking
back
slowly
towards
them
,
head
bowed
.
"
All
right
?
"
he
asked
as
she
came
up
beside
him
and
she
replied
that
she
was
,
thank
you
.
She
was
very
white
,
the
freckles
standing
out
brown
on
her
skin
,
and
she
was
blowing
her
nose
.
"
We
'll
go
up
and
see
if
we
can
see
how
she
got
here
.
Carry
on
,
Sergeant
.
"
He
plunged
up
the
embankment
,
taking
a
grateful
breath
of
fresh
air
,
then
turned
and
extended
a
large
imperative
hand
to
Catherine
Crane
and
pulled
her
up
beside
him
.
"
Were
you
sick
?
"
"
Yes
,
sorry
.
"
"
Come
on
,
let's
get
you
up
top
.
"
She
stood
on
the
embankment
breathing
in
gulps
of
air
as
he
stood
awkwardly
by
her
,
then
fumbled
for
a
handkerchief
and
he
saw
that
she
was
crying
.
"
Sorry
,
"
she
said
,
feeling
him
watching
her
and
he
fought
back
a
violent
physical
impulse
to
give
her
a
cuddle
and
take
her
away
from
all
this
.
"
Happens
,
"
he
said
gruffly
,
patting
her
gingerly
on
the
shoulder
,
and
striding
down
the
track
ahead
of
her
.
Behind
them
he
saw
a
pair
of
horses
,
obviously
having
been
warned
off
,
turning
to
ride
through
a
field
,
the
colours
of
the
riders
'
helmets
very
bright
against
the
pale
,
cold
,
February
sky
.
He
tried
to
remember
what
the
weather
had
been
like
in
the
last
week
and
realized
he
had
no
idea
;
like
many
city-dwellers
he
had
moved
from
flat
to
car
to
office
without
registering
any
variation
.
"
It
's
obviously
rained
a
lot
,
"
Catherine
Crane
volunteered
,
edging
cautiously
down
the
side
of
the
track
.
"
That
's
a
tractor
,
is
n't
it
?
I
suppose
they
could
have
come
that
way
.
"
McLeish
was
walking
the
track
,
also
keeping
well
to
one
edge
,
watching
carefully
.
"
Still
the
same
tractor
.
Hang
on
-
here
's
car
tracks
.
Faint
,
but
there
.
"
McLeish
squatted
unselfconsciously
in
the
mud
.
"
No
point
me
being
clever
.
"
He
walked
back
along
the
side
of
the
track
and
edged
down
to
join
the
scene-of-crime
squad
.
"
I
want
the
whole
track
photographed
and
samples
taken
.
Some
car
tracks
,
lots
of
tractor
tracks
,
very
deep
.
"
"
Sticky
stuff
,
this
clay
.
Likely
any
car
would
have
traces
of
it
for
a
long
time
.
Dyes
clothes
yellow
,
too
,
"
the
sergeant
in
charge
volunteered
.
"
Is
it
murder
,
then
,
sir
?
"
"
Well
,
have
you
noticed
the
head
?
It
's
out
of
shape
.
She
's
been
missing
for
a
week
,
was
going
to
marry
a
rising
Minister
,
successful
career
,
everything
coming
up
roses
.
Does
n't
look
like
an
accident
.
I
'll
get
the
doc
to
think
on
,
when
he
arrives
.
"
"
That
's
the
Land
Rover
back
now
.
I
can
hear
it
.
Likely
that
'll
be
him
.
"
It
was
and
McLeish
greeted
him
with
relief
.
This
was
a
senior
man
whom
he
had
worked
with
before
,
a
fellow
Scot
,
grey-haired
now
,
slight
,
quick-moving
and
thorough
.
He
went
back
down
the
embankment
with
him
,
telling
Catherine
to
stay
where
she
was
and
help
with
photographing
the
track
.
Dr
Scott
,
from
long
experience
,
did
no
more
than
wrinkle
his
nose
at
the
odour
of
decay
,
and
spent
twenty
minutes
there
,
mostly
occupied
with
a
careful
consideration
of
the
head
.
"
How
long
do
you
think
she
's
been
dead
?
"
"
Rigor
completely
gone
.
"
Scott
lifted
gently
one
bloodless
arm
,
which
fell
limply
.
"
Subcutaneous
swelling
,
decay
.
Six
or
seven
days
,
I
would
say
-
I
'll
not
be
able
to
be
more
precise
until
the
autopsy
.
"
"
What
was
it
,
Doc
?
"
"
Very
nasty
bang
on
the
head
for
one
thing
.
You
noticed
the
skull
is
bulging
-
there
,
look
.
Done
with
something
sharp-edged
,
and
a
lot
of
force
.
"
"
That
killed
her
?
"
John
McLeish
asked
.
"
Probably
.
I
'll
start
as
soon
as
you
can
get
the
body
back
.
I
'll
ring
you
tomorrow
or
later
tonight
.
"
McLeish
thanked
him
,
scrambled
up
the
embankment
,
drawing
in
deep
breaths
,
and
walked
carefully
down
the
side
of
the
track
in
the
sizeable
footsteps
of
his
squad
,
explaining
to
them
that
they
were
looking
for
a
sharp-edged
weapon
.
He
found
Catherine
Crane
competently
and
tactfully
assisting
with
operations
,
and
as
he
came
to
stand
beside
her
realized
she
was
so
cold
that
she
was
almost
shuddering
.
He
bustled
her
back
to
the
Land
Rover
and
raided
the
squad
's
provision
box
which
he
knew
from
experience
would
contain
thick
sandwiches
and
hot
nourishing
drinks
.
He
pressed
both
on
her
.
"
I
'm
sorry
,
"
she
said
,
when
the
shuddering
had
become
only
a
shiver
.
"
I
did
n't
realize
I
'd
got
so
cold
.
"
"
Well
,
you
lost
your
breakfast
and
you
never
got
lunch
.
We
'll
get
a
square
meal
,
then
we
'll
see
the
family
.
I
do
n't
want
to
spend
too
long
-
there
's
a
lot
else
to
do
in
London
and
I
'd
rather
have
the
autopsy
before
I
ask
too
many
questions
.
Come
on
,
we
'll
walk
back
to
the
car
.
"
Even
in
the
twenty
minutes
it
had
taken
to
get
some
nourishment
,
the
light
had
faded
and
the
dull
day
was
darkening
into
a
cold
night
;
the
beginnings
of
a
frost
crackled
under
their
feet
as
they
walked
briskly
along
the
embankment
.
The
long
ridge
to
their
left
looked
particularly
bleak
and
lifeless
,
the
heavy
clay
sitting
solidly
in
the
ridges
where
the
plough
had
left
it
months
before
,
no
trace
of
last
year
's
crop
,
nothing
to
indicate
that
this
was
good
cereal
country
.
The
tops
of
the
sapling
trees
,
waist-high
at
the
edge
of
the
embankment
,
were
leafless
and
still
.
A
bad
,
cold
night
to
lie
out
in
.
McLeish
had
to
remind
himself
that
the
dead
girl
behind
them
would
have
felt
none
of
this
dank
chill
.
It
was
almost
totally
dark
when
they
arrived
in
the
stable
yard
and
Catherine
jumped
involuntarily
as
something
moved
and
rattled
against
the
boards
.
"
The
hunters
will
be
in
-
only
the
rough
ponies
will
be
turned
out
,
"
McLeish
observed
out
of
childhood
knowledge
as
he
led
her
towards
his
car
,
looking
very
forlorn
in
the
big
parking
area
.
As
he
unlocked
it
,
a
light
came
on
almost
above
his
head
.
"
Who
is
it
?
"
It
was
a
clear
,
carrying
command
with
no
anxiety
in
it
at
all
,
and
McLeish
identified
himself
promptly
.
"
Ah
.
Will
you
come
in
for
a
cup
of
tea
?
I
have
James
Brett-Smith
,
who
found
Angela
this
morning
.
He
says
he
knows
you
and
came
back
in
case
you
wanted
to
see
him
.
"
McLeish
sighed
inwardly
.
"
Of
course
,
Miss
Williams
.
Sergeant
Crane
and
I
would
be
glad
of
tea
.
Hello
,
sunshine
.
"
This
last
was
addressed
to
Jamie
,
who
was
peering
round
Miss
Williams
and
was
openly
pleased
to
see
him
.
Not
every
day
you
saw
that
poised
,
competent
kid
distressed
,
McLeish
thought
,
resting
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
It
took
a
lot
to
faze
a
talented
one
like
that
,
who
had
been
a
successful
soloist
for
two
years
,
managing
with
having
a
sick
father
and
about
one
tenth
of
his
mother
's
attention
.
He
realized
the
boy
had
grown
in
the
two
months
since
he
had
last
seen
him
and
looked
at
him
carefully
,
noticing
the
way
his
wrists
poked
out
of
the
shirt
and
the
slight
roughness
of
the
clear
skin
.
"
Is
Francesca
still
in
New
York
?
"
the
brat
was
asking
anxiously
,
and
McLeish
,
who
had
not
wanted
to
discuss
her
in
this
company
,
found
he
had
to
reassure
Jamie
about
her
whereabouts
and
probable
date
of
return
.
"
She
's
chaperoning
for
me
on
Monday
next
week
,
"
the
boy
explained
.
"
I
'd
forgotten
,
but
she
wo
n't
have
-
Come
and
tell
me
about
this
morning
,
"
He
looked
round
for
Catherine
to
discover
that
with
admirable
good
sense
she
had
asked
for
the
facilities
of
the
house
,
and
was
being
issued
with
soap
and
hand-towels
by
Miss
Williams
.
He
took
Jamie
quickly
through
his
story
,
finding
him
healthily
excited
by
his
part
in
it
,
but
with
an
obvious
undercurrent
of
anxiety
.
"
John
,
"
Jamie
asked
when
he
had
told
his
story
,
"
you
wo
n't
leave
her
there
,
will
you
?
"
"
No
,
no
,
Jamie
,
that
's
the
ambulance
I
can
hear
now
,
come
to
pick
her
up
.
"
The
boy
's
colour
came
back
and
he
looked
shame-faced
at
McLeish
.
"
I
know
it
's
silly
,
I
mean
she
's
dead
,
but
it
's
so
cold
and
I
could
n't
bear
the
idea
of
her
just
lying
there
.
"
Curious
how
the
same
thought
had
struck
him
,
McLeish
reflected
,
as
he
looked
properly
round
the
warm
,
untidy
comfort
of
Miss
Williams
"
s
sitting-room
,
which
smelled
cheerfully
of
woodsmoke
and
wet
dog
.
A
big
black
Labrador
,
catching
his
eye
,
thumped
her
tail
and
rolled
on
her
side
,
looking
up
at
him
hopefully
.
She
closed
her
eyes
in
ecstasy
as
Jamie
flung
himself
on
her
,
accusing
her
of
being
a
flirt
.
McLeish
looked
past
the
boy
to
see
Catherine
Crane
,
colour
returned
,
seated
on
an
upright
chair
,
drinking
tea
.
He
grinned
at
her
.
"
We
'd
best
get
on
,
Miss
Williams
,
but
could
I
use
a
cloakroom
too
?
Is
Jamie
being
collected
,
or
does
he
want
a
ride
home
?
"
"
No
,
no
,
his
aunt
is
coming
for
him
.
He
's
just
polishing
some
tack
for
me
.
"
So
he
was
,
McLeish
observed
,
the
devil
plainly
being
given
no
opportunity
to
find
work
for
idle
hands
.
He
extracted
Catherine
a
short
while
later
and
turned
the
car
back
on
the
darkened
road
which
would
lead
them
towards
the
A1
.
"
There
were
three
dog
leads
and
a
packet
of
dog
biscuits
in
the
cloakroom
,
"
he
told
her
,
grinning
in
the
darkness
.
"
The
hairbrush
in
Miss
Williams
's
bathroom
had
Labrador
hairs
in
it
.
Or
it
was
the
Labrador
's
hairbrush
,
"
Catherine
Crane
offered
demurely
,
and
McLeish
burst
out
laughing
,
glancing
admiringly
sideways
at
her
.
He
felt
extremely
comfortable
with
her
already
,
he
thought
happily
.
They
followed
Miss
Williams
's
directions
to
the
Morgan
family
,
and
knocked
on
the
door
,
being
let
in
promptly
by
the
stocky
WPC
who
had
stayed
in
the
house
with
the
women
of
the
Morgan
family
.
Jennifer
Morgan
came
into
the
hall
;
she
had
been
crying
and
was
looking
white
,
but
had
herself
in
hand
.
"
Dad
is
lying
down
.
He
wanted
to
be
called
when
you
arrived
.
I
do
n't
know
if
you
would
like
to
talk
to
Mum
and
me
first
?
"
"
I
'm
sorry
to
trouble
you
now
,
but
if
you
can
bear
it
it
would
help
us
to
get
some
more
information
from
you
all
.
I
had
spoken
to
your
father
before
on
the
telephone
,
when
your
sister
was
first
reported
missing
,
but
we
did
n't
cover
all
that
much
ground
.
"
"
Oh
,
I
'd
rather
talk
about
it
now
,
"
Jennifer
Morgan
said
drearily
.
"
You
've
talked
to
Giles
,
of
course
?
"
"
When
he
reported
your
sister
missing
"
"
McLeish
confirmed
,
leaping
at
the
opening
.
"
I
understand
that
you
have
known
him
longest
of
all
the
family
?
"
"
Yes
.
"
"
Do
you
know
him
well
?
"
She
gave
him
a
level
look
,
understanding
that
he
must
be
working
,
as
they
say
,
on
information
received
.
Quick
,
as
her
dead
sister
must
have
been
.
"
We
did
go
out
together
a
few
times
,
yes
,
Chief
Inspector
.
I
liked
him
,
but
he
and
Angela
are
-
were
-
better
suited
to
each
other
.
"
It
must
have
been
painful
to
have
a
man
you
liked
appropriated
by
a
younger
sister
,
McLeish
thought
,
but
this
self-contained
creature
was
not
going
to
tell
him
-
or
possibly
anyone
else
-
how
it
had
felt
.
He
considered
her
,
as
he
went
through
the
routine
questions
about
when
she
had
last
seen
her
sister
.
"
We
did
n't
meet
very
often
in
London
unless
it
was
a
party
.
I
work
in
the
British
Museum
,
and
my
flat
is
quite
close
to
it
.
I
"
m
an
Assistant
Curator
in
the
Middle
Eastern
section
.
"
McLeish
blinked
involuntarily
,
and
she
smiled
faintly
.
"
I
read
Middle
Eastern
Languages
,
and
spent
a
year
in
Turkey
after
Oxford
,
then
came
back
to
the
Museum
.
I
specialize
in
fourteenth-century
ceramics
.
"
It
was
a
less
lively
face
than
her
sister
's
because
it
was
more
turned
in
,
more
contemplative
,
less
concerned
with
the
things
of
this
world
.
Well
,
fourteenth-century
Turkey
must
be
pretty
safely
removed
from
the
things
of
this
world
.
He
considered
her
good
but
unremarkable
clothes
,
and
wondered
what
she
did
for
laughs
.
Or
was
fourteenth-century
Turkey
laughs
enough
,
what
did
he
know
?
He
fell
back
on
routine
and
asked
Jennifer
to
confirm
exactly
when
she
had
last
seen
Angela
.
"
I
last
saw
her
here
,
the
weekend
before
she
disappeared
.
She
came
up
here
for
a
night
to
see
Mummy
,
to
sort
out
some
details
about
the
wedding
.
"
"
That
must
be
a
lot
of
work
for
your
mother
,
"
McLeish
said
,
hopefully
,
and
got
another
level
,
distantly
amused
look
.
"
You
would
have
to
ask
her
that
.
My
impression
was
that
since
it
was
to
be
held
in
London
,
Angela
was
doing
the
work
,
with
a
good
deal
of
help
from
colleagues
at
Yeo
Davis
.
They
have
a
lot
of
experience
of
large
parties
.
"
Ouch
,
McLeish
thought
,
not
such
a
gentle
,
distant
academic
,
are
you
?
A
very
sardonic
eye
there
indeed
.
"
We
talked
to
Mr
Yeo
when
your
sister
was
reported
missing
.
He
obviously
considered
your
sister
a
very
valuable
colleague
.
"
"
She
is
-
was
-
extremely
competent
,
as
well
as
very
good
at
getting
on
with
people
,
which
is
of
course
critical
to
jobs
like
that
.
I
imagine
she
will
be
very
much
missed
.
"
She
looked
sharply
out
of
the
window
and
produced
a
handkerchief
which
she
held
clenched
in
her
hand
but
did
not
use
.
"
Miss
Morgan
,
would
you
like
to
stop
for
a
minute
?
Can
we
get
you
some
more
coffee
?
"
McLeish
glanced
at
Catherine
who
was
already
on
her
feet
,
and
Jennifer
Morgan
nodded
in
acquiescence
.
"
I
'm
sorry
.
I
'll
just
go
and
tidy
up
.
"
She
got
up
stiffly
and
went
upstairs
,
holding
blindly
on
to
the
banisters
.
McLeish
joined
Catherine
in
the
comfortable
modern
kitchen
where
they
foraged
companionably
for
coffee
and
milk
,
waiting
until
they
heard
Jennifer
Morgan
come
down
again
.
"
I
'm
sorry
,
"
she
said
,
wearily
.
"
Where
were
we
?
My
mother
is
coming
in
a
minute
.
"
"
We
were
asking
about
your
sister
's
position
at
Yeo
Davis
.
I
think
you
had
made
it
clear
that
Mr
Yeo
very
much
valued
her
.
Would
she
have
wanted
to
continue
working
there
after
she
was
married
?
"
Jennifer
Morgan
looked
at
him
quickly
and
he
realized
he
must
have
stumbled
on
something
.
But
she
knew
her
hesitation
had
given
him
a
lead
.
"
She
would
have
wanted
to
continue
,
yes
.
There
might
have
been
some
difficulty
there
because
of
Giles
"
s
position
,
because
of
the
conflict
of
interest
.
Yeo
Davis
exists
to
lobby
government
and
Giles
is
a
Minister
.
"
She
sounded
like
Francesca
when
she
talked
about
Yeo
Davis
,
McLeish
reflected
.
"
Did
he
want
her
to
give
it
up
?
"
"
Yes
,
he
did
.
He
found
it
awkward
,
but
Angela
was
-
naturally
-
reluctant
.
"
Some
colour
had
come
back
into
Jennifer
's
face
.
So
he
talked
to
you
about
it
,
McLeish
thought
,
and
saw
Catherine
register
the
same
point
.
He
decided
to
leave
this
one
for
the
moment
but
logged
the
fact
that
Jennifer
Morgan
had
still
been
interested
in
,
and
comfortable
with
,
the
man
who
had
become
her
sister
's
fiance
.
A
tap
on
the
door
made
them
all
start
.
Catherine
Crane
went
across
to
open
it
and
held
a
murmured
conversation
with
someone
.
Sarah
Morgan
came
in
to
the
room
like
a
ghost
,
and
McLeish
drew
breath
as
he
saw
her
.
She
was
deathly
pale
,
the
mid-brown
hair
flattened
to
her
head
,
the
lined
skin
without
make-up
except
for
a
brave
but
mistaken
line
of
smudged
lipstick
.
She
looked
at
him
dumbly
,
and
even
McLeish
's
hardened
investigator
's
nerve
failed
him
.
He
glanced
involuntarily
at
Jennifer
Morgan
who
said
she
would
make
tea
,
which
was
what
her
mother
preferred
,
and
bore
her
off
to
the
kitchen
.
They
returned
with
the
tea
accompanied
by
a
bottle
of
pills
-
Valium
,
McLeish
noticed
automatically
-
and
with
Mrs
Morgan
looking
more
gathered
.
The
buttons
of
her
cardigan
were
correctly
done
up
and
the
collar
flattened
neatly
,
the
zip
of
the
skirt
was
in
its
proper
place
at
the
side
and
her
tattered
bedroom
slippers
had
been
replaced
with
a
tidy
pair
of
court
shoes
,
the
wrong
colour
for
the
skirt
.
It
was
better
,
but
not
a
lot
,
and
McLeish
who
knew
her
to
be
in
her
late
fifties
decided
any
casual
observer
would
put
her
at
nearer
seventy
.
Jennifer
Morgan
looked
at
him
doubtfully
,
but
he
shook
his
head
to
her
implied
question
;
he
preferred
to
conduct
his
interviews
without
members
of
the
family
present
.
"
Wo
n't
be
long
,
"
he
said
,
reassuringly
,
just
managing
not
to
pat
Jennifer
Morgan
on
her
beige
cashmere
shoulder
.
He
was
extremely
gentle
with
Sarah
Morgan
,
as
he
had
implicitly
promised
her
daughter
,
but
it
was
a
desperately
painful
experience
,
and
,
he
began
to
fear
,
not
a
useful
one
.
She
had
not
seen
Angela
since
the
weekend
before
the
one
on
which
she
had
disappeared
,
but
had
spoken
to
her
twice
on
the
telephone
.
Well
yes
,
Angie
had
been
very
busy
and
preoccupied
with
the
wedding
preparations
,
naturally
,
but
she
had
been
happy
.
And
no
,
they
had
not
been
expecting
to
see
her
that
weekend
,
though
with
Giles
away
she
had
said
she
might
come
on
the
Sunday
.
But
she
would
have
telephoned
first
.
She
seemed
to
be
eased
by
talking
of
her
daughter
,
and
by
the
time
she
stopped
,
apologetically
,
and
drank
some
tea
poured
for
her
by
Catherine
,
she
looked
exhausted
but
less
like
a
wraith
.
She
pushed
the
Valium
aside
,
observing
that
she
did
prefer
not
to
take
drugs
,
a
reaction
so
typical
of
her
age
and
class
that
McLeish
decided
he
might
after
all
be
able
to
conduct
a
useful
interview
.
"
I
understand
it
was
your
older
daughter
who
met
Mr
Hawick
first
?
"
"
Yes
,
she
did
,
and
I
think
she
hoped
something
would
come
of
it
-
well
,
so
did
I.
But
when
he
met
Angela
he
was
just
bowled
over
by
her
.
I
was
sorry
for
Jennifer
but
they
had
only
been
going
out
for
a
month
or
so
,
and
not
terribly
seriously
.
And
in
any
case
,
you
ca
n't
do
anything
about
these
attractions
,
can
you
?
"
McLeish
agreed
with
her
promptly
and
she
raised
half
a
smile
for
him
.
He
waited
,
remembering
Jennifer
Morgan
's
obvious
pain
and
wondering
what
her
mother
's
views
about
it
were
.
He
watched
her
thoughtfully
as
she
ate
a
biscuit
.
"
Angela
must
have
been
a
very
attractive
girl
,
"
he
suggested
,
cautiously
.
"
Oh
,
she
was
,
"
Sarah
Morgan
agreed
.
"
But
I
used
to
wonder
whether
she
was
ever
going
to
get
married
.
She
never
seemed
to
fall
for
anyone
her
own
age
,
they
were
always
older
.
"
She
was
talking
with
the
ease
of
total
emotional
exhaustion
.
"
Was
there
anyone
else
who
was
important
to
her
-
I
mean
before
she
met
Mr
Hawick
,
of
course
?
"
he
asked
,
vaguely
.
Mrs
Morgan
took
another
biscuit
and
accepted
another
cup
of
tea
.
"
I
did
think
that
there
was
something
between
her
and
Peter
Yeo
-
her
partner
-
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
He
has
a
wife
and
children
and
most
men
do
n't
usually
leave
their
wives
,
do
they
?
"
The
question
was
rhetorical
and
McLeish
waited
.
"
Anyway
,
Giles
was
perfect
for
her
;
fourteen
years
older
and
with
his
own
very
distinguished
career
.
I
was
sure
she
was
going
to
be
happily
settled
.
"
She
stopped
,
staring
out
of
the
window
,
her
hands
clenched
together
.
"
And
then
this
terrible
thing
happens
.
Who
could
have
wanted
to
kill
her
?
"
Francis
Morgan
did
not
bother
with
knocking
at
the
door
but
walked
in
without
apology
.
He
was
deathly
pale
and
obviously
still
in
the
first
shock
of
grief
but
it
had
taken
him
differently
.
He
was
wound
up
like
a
spring
,
furiously
angry
,
unable
to
keep
still
or
to
prevent
himself
from
fidgeting
.
"
Where
's
Sarah
?
"
he
demanded
,
and
took
in
the
scene
in
front
of
him
.
"
Why
did
n't
you
wake
me
?
"
"
I
understand
the
doctor
wanted
you
to
have
a
sleep
if
you
could
,
Mr
Morgan
"
"
Catherine
Crane
said
briskly
.
"
Would
you
like
some
tea
?
We
have
only
just
started
talking
with
Mrs
Morgan
.
"
She
looked
very
young
and
pretty
as
she
held
up
the
teapot
and
Francis
Morgan
hesitated
,
then
sat
down
,
heavily
,
and
seized
two
biscuits
.
"
Sorry
,
"
he
said
,
awkwardly
,
through
a
mouthful
of
Rich
Tea
.
"
I
ca
n't
stop
thinking
about
her
and
wondering
what
happened
.
"
He
slapped
both
hands
palms
down
on
the
table
,
slopping
his
tea
and
making
them
all
jump
,
totally
unselfconscious
in
his
misery
.
What
,
McLeish
wondered
acerbically
,
did
he
imagine
his
wife
and
surviving
daughter
were
thinking
about
-
or
did
he
assume
they
had
taken
the
death
of
a
daughter
and
a
sister
in
their
stride
?
From
under
his
eyelashes
he
could
see
Mrs
Morgan
was
watching
her
husband
with
a
sort
of
furious
compassion
,
and
was
careful
not
to
catch
her
eye
.
The
man
was
quite
literally
distracted
,
unable
to
concentrate
at
all
.
McLeish
looked
thoughtfully
at
Jennifer
Morgan
who
had
come
in
and
was
considering
her
father
with
what
he
was
startled
to
recognize
as
dislike
.
This
was
evidently
a
family
that
was
not
going
to
be
brought
closer
by
grief
.
She
nodded
to
McLeish
and
started
gently
to
bustle
her
mother
away
.
He
settled
Francis
Morgan
down
as
best
he
could
and
took
him
again
through
the
events
of
the
week
before
his
daughter
vanished
.
No
,
he
had
n't
seen
her
for
a
week
before
that
weekend
;
he
had
missed
her
-
this
with
a
baleful
glance
towards
the
door
-
and
had
indeed
got
as
far
as
ringing
her
up
on
the
Saturday
morning
,
hoping
she
would
come
up
for
Sunday
,
but
had
got
no
answer
from
her
flat
.
"
It
was
n't
worth
going
down
on
the
off-chance
,
or
so
I
thought
.
But
perhaps
if
I
had
-
"
"
You
were
close
to
your
daughter
,
then
?
"
McLeish
asked
hopefully
.
"
Yes
.
We
were
like
each
other
;
she
knew
what
she
wanted
and
she
did
n't
mess
around
.
I
ca
n't
bear
people
who
do
n't
know
what
they
want
and
dither
.
"
"
So
you
were
pleased
that
she
was
marrying
?
"
"
Not
particularly
.
"
McLeish
did
not
manage
to
conceal
surprise
and
Francis
Morgan
looked
at
him
wretchedly
,
the
restless
brown
eyes
wide-set
,
like
the
dead
girl
's
,
and
very
bright
.
"
He
's
all
right
,
I
suppose
,
Giles
-
for
a
politician
.
But
he
thinks
he
's
the
centre
of
the
world
and
he
was
going
to
make
it
difficult
for
Angie
to
do
what
she
wanted
if
it
would
affect
his
career
.
He
likes
all
that
,
the
cars
and
people
calling
him
Minister
,
but
he
wanted
her
to
be
the
good
politician
's
wife
,
doing
his
entertaining
.
He
did
n't
say
so
,
mind
,
but
I
told
Angie
she
would
have
to
watch
it
after
she
married
him
.
And
he
wanted
her
money
,
of
course
.
These
chaps
do
n't
have
security
of
tenure
.
"
McLeish
reflected
that
Giles
Hawick
was
the
classic
example
of
someone
who
knew
what
they
wanted
and
did
n't
mess
around
,
and
that
that
was
what
had
attracted
Francis
Morgan
's
daughter
.
Perhaps
he
had
not
said
to
himself
that
in
a
marriage
between
two
like
this
,
someone
was
going
to
have
to
know
a
little
less
clearly
what
they
had
wanted
.
"
Was
there
someone
else
around
you
would
rather
she
had
married
?
"
he
asked
bluntly
,
deciding
it
was
that
sort
of
conversation
.
"
No
one
in
particular
,
but
I
thought
she
'd
have
been
better
off
with
a
chap
of
her
own
age
who
would
have
wanted
her
to
carry
on
where
she
was
.
Someone
who
would
have
known
she
was
exceptional
and
have
encouraged
her
.
"
And
been
less
of
a
direct
rival
to
her
Dad
,
and
all
,
McLeish
thought
,
and
stuck
to
his
line
.
"
And
there
was
no
one
like
that
in
her
life
?
"
Francis
Morgan
,
calmer
now
,
visibly
bent
his
mind
to
the
question
.
"
She
had
dozens
of
boyfriends
,
"
he
said
,
wistfully
.
"
I
probably
met
them
all
.
But
they
did
n't
seem
to
last
very
long
.
She
did
n't
want
to
settle
down
,
you
see
,
and
they
all
wanted
her
to
.
"
McLeish
decided
he
was
not
going
to
get
much
more
out
of
this
and
went
on
to
check
,
gently
,
what
Francis
Morgan
had
done
with
the
weekend
.
He
appeared
to
have
spent
it
blamelessly
playing
golf
,
dining
with
neighbours
and
at
home
doing
some
work
.
He
would
check
it
,
if
he
needed
to
,
but
he
could
not
at
the
moment
see
why
Morgan
would
have
wanted
to
kill
the
daughter
to
whom
he
had
plainly
been
so
devoted
.
He
managed
to
have
another
few
words
with
Mrs
Morgan
also
,
who
was
looking
much
stronger
.
She
apologized
obliquely
for
her
husband
,
and
McLeish
murmured
that
Mr
Morgan
had
obviously
been
very
much
attached
to
Angela
.
"
So
was
I
,
Chief
Inspector
,
"
Sarah
Morgan
said
evenly
.
"
And
I
was
glad
she
was
marrying
an
older
man
like
Giles
Hawick
.
"
The
emphasis
on
the
"
I
"
was
faint
but
definite
and
McLeish
carried
the
echo
away
in
his
head
.
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
sound
ungrateful
,
but
I
'm
starving
,
"
Catherine
said
,
as
they
reached
the
gate
.
"
Can
you
wait
till
London
?
There
's
a
good
place
in
Ealing
-
well
it
's
a
chipper
really
,
but
he
has
good
steaks
at
any
time
you
want
them
.
Have
a
sleep
if
you
want
.
"
She
slept
deeply
while
they
were
on
the
motorway
,
but
woke
as
he
came
into
London
and
had
to
stop
and
start
in
the
heavy
evening
traffic
.
"
Better
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
at
him
.
"
Dinner
"
s
not
far
.
"
Restored
by
a
large
steak
,
he
explained
to
her
as
they
ate
that
he
liked
to
work
very
quickly
on
a
murder
case
,
pushing
everyone
to
get
an
answer
.
"
I
expect
that
means
you
do
more
cases
than
most
?
"
"
I
've
been
a
bit
lucky
,
"
he
said
,
modestly
.
"
I
've
ended
up
most
of
them
with
a
full
confession
,
once
we
'd
worked
it
out
.
That
way
you
know
you
've
got
it
right
.
"
"
Unless
you
're
in
Henley
,
"
she
observed
with
privileged
acerbity
and
he
laughed
,
embarrassed
as
every
policeman
had
been
by
the
revelations
just
made
of
Thames
Valley
's
modus
operandi
.
"
Eight
cases
withdrawn
so
far
,
is
n't
it
?
"
Catherine
asked
.
"
And
more
to
come
.
"
He
smiled
at
her
,
thinking
what
a
treat
it
was
to
talk
shop
with
someone
as
beautiful
and
intelligent
as
this
.
She
insisted
quietly
on
halving
the
bill
and
he
let
her
have
her
way
,
not
wanting
to
jeopardize
his
chance
of
eating
with
her
in
the
future
.
He
glanced
up
as
they
completed
this
transaction
to
find
the
attention
of
the
nearest
two
tables
,
both
exclusively
male
,
fixed
disbelievingly
on
them
.
As
three
men
slowly
looked
away
McLeish
received
the
uncompromising
message
that
if
any
of
them
had
been
so
lucky
as
to
have
dinner
with
Catherine
Crane
,
none
of
them
would
have
let
her
pay
for
herself
.
Indeed
he
had
a
strong
feeling
that
only
his
six
foot
four
inches
prevented
one
of
them
from
saying
so
.
He
glanced
at
Catherine
but
she
had
obviously
noticed
nothing
out
of
the
way
.
Outside
the
restaurant
McLeish
hesitated
,
not
wanting
the
evening
to
end
.
"
A
drink
?
"
he
suggested
,
hopefully
,
but
Catherine
shook
her
head
.
"
My
flat
is
in
almost
as
much
of
a
mess
as
the
office
.
I
was
in
a
chain
,
and
I
only
managed
to
complete
last
week
.
I
'd
better
go
and
get
it
straight
.
I
have
n't
even
got
the
curtains
hung
,
or
unpacked
the
kitchen
stuff
.
"
"
Let
me
come
and
help
?
"
McLeish
offered
,
cheerfully
.
"
It
is
the
fault
of
C1
that
you
do
n't
have
today
or
tomorrow
to
get
straight
.
I
'll
come
and
put
in
a
couple
of
hours
,
so
you
can
get
a
bit
more
comfortable
.
"
She
hesitated
,
then
said
that
she
would
like
that
rather
than
a
drink
,
if
he
really
would
n't
mind
.
The
flat
was
indeed
in
some
disarray
:
immaculately
clean
,
evidently
she
had
done
that
first
,
but
with
most
of
its
furnishings
disposed
in
boxes
on
the
floor
.
McLeish
,
naturally
efficient
and
brought
up
by
a
mother
with
firm
views
on
men
's
participation
in
the
drearier
household
chores
,
took
just
over
an
hour
to
sort
her
kitchen
to
her
satisfaction
while
she
got
the
living-room
straight
,
with
all
the
books
unpacked
.
"
That
's
marvellous
.
Thank
you
very
much
.
Can
I
give
you
a
coffee
?
"
"
I
'd
like
that
.
Then
I
'll
be
off
so
you
can
catch
up
with
yourself
.
"
They
fell
comfortably
into
gossip
about
various
parts
of
their
experience
until
McLeish
noticed
she
was
looking
tired
.
"
I
'm
off
,
"
he
said
,
briskly
.
"
I
'll
be
going
into
the
Yard
first
thing
to
work
out
what
's
to
do
.
I
'll
not
need
anyone
till
about
lunch-time
so
you
have
your
sleep
in
,
but
I
may
ring
you
up
after
that
.
I
find
if
you
get
the
case
started
off
quickly
it
all
goes
easily
.
"
She
thanked
him
demurely
,
and
he
realized
she
was
laughing
at
him
.
He
looked
down
at
her
,
about
to
kiss
her
good-night
as
if
she
were
one
of
Francesca
's
friends
,
and
pulled
himself
up
.
This
was
a
colleague
,
a
fellow
detective
.
As
well
take
to
kissing
Bruce
Davidson
good-night
,
he
told
himself
,
and
got
himself
out
of
the
door
on
this
thought
.
The
telephone
was
ringing
as
McLeish
walked
into
his
own
flat
,
and
he
picked
it
up
to
find
his
Commander
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
.
"
So
I
've
arranged
you
'll
take
a
statement
from
Hawick
tomorrow
afternoon
,
then
.
"
"
We
have
n't
got
the
autopsy
,
sir
,
so
I
've
no
idea
when
the
girl
died
,
yet
.
I
'll
have
to
see
him
again
when
I
do
know
.
Would
n't
he
rather
wait
twenty-four
hours
?
"
"
He
's
a
busy
man
.
Also
he
wants
to
talk
to
someone
,
he
wants
to
make
sure
we
're
doing
our
job
.
Do
n't
give
me
a
hard
time
,
McLeish
,
just
bloody
do
it
.
"
"
Sir
.
"
"
Do
n't
be
like
that
.
Take
that
gorgeous
sergeant
of
yours
,
give
Hawick
something
to
look
at
.
"
"
She
's
been
with
me
in
Cambridge
all
day
-
I
told
her
she
could
have
Sunday
off
.
"
"
Then
tell
her
different
.
She
with
you
?
"
"
No
,
sir
.
I
left
her
at
her
flat
.
"
"
Your
girl
's
due
back
when
?
"
McLeish
raised
his
eyebrows
,
taken
aback
by
the
transparency
of
his
superior
's
line
of
thought
,
and
primly
gave
him
Francesca
's
projected
timetable
.
"
Glad
to
hear
it
.
Good
luck
with
the
Minister
,
and
give
me
a
ring
afterwards
.
I
like
to
know
where
the
bullets
are
coming
from
.
G'night
.
"
McLeish
,
shaking
his
head
,
rang
Catherine
and
broke
it
to
her
apologetically
that
she
would
be
required
for
the
afternoon
.
"
Does
n't
matter
.
We
-
you
-
would
have
had
to
see
him
soon
anyway
.
Is
the
autopsy
going
to
give
us
much
idea
when
Angela
Morgan
died
-
I
mean
within
a
day
or
so
?
"
"
Probably
not
,
"
McLeish
conceded
.
He
went
to
bed
to
dream
uneasily
,
and
woke
early
as
he
always
did
in
the
early
stages
of
a
case
before
he
had
got
the
machine
working
properly
.
At
tea-ti
me
the
next
day
he
picked
up
Catherine
at
her
flat
,
noticing
that
she
was
looking
rested
and
pretty
even
if
he
was
feeling
jaded
and
disaffected
.
They
were
received
in
the
Minister
's
private
flat
in
one
of
the
narrow
streets
close
to
the
House
of
Commons
.
McLeish
remembered
that
this
man
's
constituency
was
in
Derbyshire
.
They
took
a
tiny
,
cramped
lift
to
the
top
floor
of
the
building
and
were
admitted
by
Hawick
,
who
was
wearing
an
expensive
blue-green
sweater
,
and
slacks
,
the
clothes
sitting
easily
on
his
long
,
slim
frame
,
the
dark
hair
beautifully
cut
,
a
little
too
long
,
flopping
on
his
forehead
.
Despite
the
elegance
,
it
was
a
completely
masculine
presence
,
and
he
dominated
the
room
as
easily
as
he
had
his
own
office
.
He
was
grim-faced
and
looked
as
if
he
had
not
slept
,
but
he
offered
them
freshly
made
coffee
and
raised
a
smile
for
Catherine
.
He
saw
her
comfortably
established
at
a
table
-
"
I
know
you
'll
want
to
take
notes
"
-
and
offered
McLeish
his
choice
of
three
big
armchairs
.
"
I
'm
not
sure
some
of
the
upright
ones
will
hold
you
,
Chief
Inspector
,
I
sit
on
them
very
gingerly
myself
.
"
Hawick
chose
a
big
chair
by
the
fireplace
in
which
a
simulated
coal
fire
burned
merrily
,
emitting
real
warmth
thanks
to
the
gas
which
powered
it
.
"
I
'd
prefer
a
proper
fire
,
of
course
,
but
we
made
them
illegal
in
this
part
of
London
some
years
ago
.
"
"
We
"
,
McLeish
remembered
from
Francesca
,
did
not
necessarily
mean
this
administration
but
must
mean
one
of
the
same
political
persuasion
.
Measures
passed
by
those
of
a
different
political
hue
were
described
as
the
work
of
a
"
previous
government
"
.
A
good
room
to
be
in
,
McLeish
thought
,
with
its
high
ceiling
and
the
Sunday
quiet
of
London
,
and
what
was
obviously
a
copy
of
every
Sunday
paper
published
lying
tidily
on
a
side
table
.
"
It
comes
with
the
job
,
"
Giles
Hawick
explained
,
following
his
eye
.
"
We
read
them
all
.
There
is
nothing
yet
about
Angela
in
any
of
them
.
"
"
No
,
sir
.
We
did
not
have
a
definite
identification
until
late
yesterday
afternoon
,
in
any
case
.
"
"
Poor
Francis
.
He
rang
me
last
night
,
very
kindly
,
principally
I
think
to
assure
me
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
.
That
it
was
Angela
,
I
mean
.
"
"
I
'm
very
sorry
.
"
"
Were
you
there
too
?
Did
you
see
Francis
-
Mr
Morgan
?
"
"
Yes
,
we
were
,
although
it
was
a
Cambridge
officer
who
broke
the
news
because
I
did
n't
want
any
delay
in
case
the
Press
got
it
.
We
were
actually
with
him
when
he
made
the
identification
,
though
.
"
"
I
've
been
to
that
riding-stable
-
Angela
's
sister
Jennifer
and
I
went
hacking
one
day
when
I
stayed
the
weekend
there
.
It
's
an
excellent
stable
-
they
produced
a
very
good
hunter
for
me
once
Jennifer
had
assured
them
I
was
safe
.
I
ca
n't
remember
it
all
,
but
I
think
we
rode
along
the
old
railway
line
.
"
He
bit
his
lip
and
looked
into
the
remorseless
,
even
flames
.
"
I
was
just
following
Jennifer
's
lead
.
"
"
You
only
went
once
?
"
"
Twice
.
Angela
did
n't
ride
,
though
she
had
done
as
a
child
.
I
told
you
,
I
think
,
that
I
had
met
Jennifer
first
,
some
time
ago
.
"
"
Indeed
.
"
Well
,
it
was
interesting
,
McLeish
thought
gravely
,
making
an
unnecessary
note
,
that
Giles
Hawick
had
admitted
unprompted
to
the
local
knowledge
necessary
for
disposing
of
Angela
Morgan
's
body
in
that
particular
place
.
But
it
had
been
the
older
sister
he
had
gone
there
with
,
and
had
apparently
abandoned
in
favour
of
the
younger
,
more
exciting
girl
.
He
decided
he
was
n't
going
to
get
anywhere
along
those
lines
,
or
not
yet
,
and
went
over
again
the
details
of
when
Hawick
had
last
seen
his
fiancee
.
He
found
his
account
,
as
he
would
have
expected
,
consistent
,
and
considered
the
man
carefully
as
he
did
so
.
For
all
his
ambition
,
Hawick
was
obviously
a
man
of
strong
passions
and
,
for
McLeish
's
money
,
well
capable
of
murder
.
There
was
,
however
,
no
apparent
motive
,
McLeish
reminded
himself
,
and
he
must
not
let
his
own
uneasy
conviction
that
Angela
Morgan
would
have
been
more
than
capable
of
stirring
up
strong
and
complex
emotions
in
those
around
her
cloud
his
judgement
.
Time
to
ask
the
obvious
question
.
"
We
're
at
a
very
early
stage
in
all
this
,
Minister
,
but
can
you
think
of
anyone
who
would
have
wanted
to
harm
Miss
Morgan
?
"
"
Yes
.
"
McLeish
blinked
at
him
,
startled
.
"
Yes
,
I
can
think
of
one
or
two
people
who
might
have
wanted
to
harm
her
,
as
you
suggest
.
None
who
might
have
carried
that
wish
to
the
length
of
killing
her
.
I
take
it
her
death
can
not
have
been
accidental
?
"
"
Probably
not
,
"
McLeish
agreed
,
thinking
of
the
misshapen
skull
.
"
Who
had
reason
to
wish
her
ill
,
then
?
"
"
She
was
left
a
large
legacy
by
an
ex-employer
.
His
niece
,
who
is
a
little
unbalanced
,
took
this
very
badly
,
despite
the
fact
she
herself
was
a
substantial
legatee
.
She
certainly
made
threats
against
Angela
and
has
bothered
her
recently
.
This
is
a
woman
called
Penelope
Huntley
.
I
've
never
spoken
to
her
myself
but
I
know
Angela
had
found
it
necessary
to
get
her
solicitor
to
write
.
"
McLeish
made
a
note
.
"
We
have
n't
been
able
yet
to
speak
to
Miss
Morgan
's
solicitor
,
"
he
observed
.
"
Do
you
know
if
she
left
a
will
?
"
"
Indeed
she
did
.
We
both
made
new
wills
last
week
,
in
expectation
of
marriage
.
We
each
left
the
bulk
of
our
estates
to
the
other
,
with
a
couple
of
minor
legacies
-
my
old
college
and
a
couple
of
godchildren
on
my
side
,
and
her
sister
on
hers
.
"
"
Do
you
know
what
Miss
Morgan
's
previous
will
provided
?
"
"
No
,
I
do
n't
.
But
that
will
,
of
course
,
is
the
only
one
that
's
valid
.
We
never
married
.
"
The
wide
mouth
twisted
.
"
So
the
wills
we
made
last
week
are
irrelevant
.
"
He
looked
suddenly
tired
and
old
,
the
deep
lines
in
his
face
intensified
.
"
There
were
probably
professional
jealousies
in
Angela
's
life
,
too
,
"
he
said
,
wearily
,
rubbing
the
patch
between
his
eyebrows
in
a
gesture
McLeish
recognized
from
his
television
appearances
.
"
You
mean
she
could
have
run
into
trouble
as
a
result
of
her
professional
activities
?
"
he
asked
,
cautiously
.
"
I
hope
not
.
I
must
say
I
was
not
totally
happy
about
her
going
on
at
Yeo
Davis
,
with
me
in
the
government
.
But
she
was
very
reluctant
to
give
it
up
and
there
is
a
precedent
.
One
of
my
Ministerial
colleagues
is
married
to
a
partner
in
a
firm
specializing
in
financial
public
relations
where
there
are
similar
possibilities
for
conflict
of
interest
.
"
But
maybe
your
Ministerial
colleague
is
n't
going
right
for
the
very
top
,
McLeish
thought
with
unreasonable
conviction
,
and
you
were
going
to
stop
her
working
at
Yeo
Davis
when
you
could
.
He
glanced
up
and
found
the
cool
blue
eyes
on
him
.
"
That
being
said
,
anyone
will
tell
you
that
a
Minister
of
the
Crown
needs
a
wife
capable
of
supporting
him
.
It
's
one
of
those
jobs
where
the
pay
does
n't
actually
cover
the
cost
of
the
lifestyle
,
and
you
can
be
out
on
you
one
day
and
the
next
.
But
I
think
we
would
have
tried
to
find
her
a
job
rather
more
removed
from
mine
,
over
time
.
"
A
very
fair
admission
,
McLeish
thought
admiringly
,
and
made
his
standard
speech
about
the
need
,
if
he
might
,
to
come
back
on
various
points
as
they
occurred
to
him
.
"
Of
course
you
must
.
Just
so
long
as
you
are
not
intending
to
ask
me
not
to
leave
London
.
I
'm
in
Newcastle
tomorrow
and
the
day
after
,
and
next
week
I
have
several
days
in
Washington
.
I
have
told
you
where
I
was
already
.
"
He
hesitated
.
"
I
'm
assuming
she
was
killed
on
the
Saturday
,
of
course
,
when
she
first
went
missing
,
as
we
now
know
.
I
hope
so
.
I
mean
it
would
be
worse
if
she
had
been
-
hurt
-
first
.
"
McLeish
instantly
understood
the
man
's
nightmare
but
realized
he
could
give
only
qualified
reassurance
.
"
She
was
probably
killed
by
a
blow
on
the
head
,
Minister
.
We
have
not
had
the
autopsy
result
.
"
"
Can
you
let
me
know
?
"
"
Certainly
.
"
He
and
Catherine
took
their
leave
and
crammed
themselves
again
into
the
rickety
lift
.
It
was
another
windy
,
sunny
day
,
the
brilliant
February
sun
which
has
no
strength
in
it
but
still
gives
the
reassurance
that
summer
will
come
and
a
sun
will
shine
with
real
warmth
again
.
Discarded
papers
blew
in
the
narrow
street
as
they
walked
back
to
the
car
.
"
John
,
excuse
me
.
Are
we
allowed
to
tell
people
involved
in
the
case
what
the
autopsy
result
is
?
"
"
If
that
one
's
a
murderer
he
knows
what
happened
.
If
he
is
n't
,
it
does
n't
matter
what
he
knows
and
he
can
go
over
my
head
any
day
he
likes
and
make
the
Assistant
Commissioner
read
him
the
whole
report
if
he
wants
to
.
No
point
me
being
difficult
.
"
He
got
a
respectful
sideways
look
,
which
he
appreciated
,
and
smiled
down
at
her
.
"
Did
you
think
he
was
a
murderer
,
Catherine
?
"
"
Well
capable
of
it
,
if
crossed
,
"
she
said
,
promptly
.
"
But
I
ca
n't
see
the
motive
.
"
"
What
about
if
Angela
Morgan
was
involved
with
another
bloke
and
he
found
out
?
"
"
Yes
,
then
.
But
not
if
he
had
time
to
think
what
it
would
do
to
his
career
.
"
McLeish
grinned
.
"
He
's
too
ambitious
.
He
's
one
of
these
blokes
where
he
comes
number
1
,
2
and
3
,
and
anyone
else
comes
nowhere
.
"
There
was
real
feeling
in
this
judgement
,
McLeish
decided
,
and
tried
to
imagine
what
kind
of
man
had
decided
to
relegate
Catherine
Crane
to
fourth
place
in
his
scheme
of
things
.
In
a
windy
,
cold
field
in
Cambridgeshire
,
green
with
winter
wheat
,
half
a
mile
away
from
where
Angela
Morgan
's
body
had
been
found
,
a
small
man
with
a
narrow
,
turned-down
mouth
sat
smoking
his
twentieth
cigarette
of
the
day
at
the
wheel
of
a
Land
Rover
.
He
arrived
at
a
decision
,
threw
the
cigarette
away
,
and
turned
towards
a
small
depressing
row
of
agricultural
cottages
.
He
emerged
two
minutes
later
with
a
bulky
small
man
,
and
the
Land
Rover
turned
on
to
the
Cambridge
road
,
making
for
the
headquarters
of
the
regional
crime
squad
.
An
hour
later
the
phone
rang
in
New
Scotland
Yard
where
John
McLeish
was
sitting
reading
the
scene-of-crime
report
.
"
A
what
?
Yes
,
sorry
,
of
course
I
've
heard
of
ploughs
.
My
mind
was
n't
with
you
.
Standing
there
,
was
it
?
Yes
,
I
've
got
the
scene-of-crime
report
,
hang
on
-
yes
,
deep
tracks
,
evidently
belonging
to
a
tractor
,
plus
other
deep
tracks
,
query
agricultural
machinery
.
Well
,
you
ca
n't
blame
them
,
Sergeant
,
they
're
like
me
,
not
used
to
the
country
,
real
townees
.
It
was
a
plough
,
was
it
?
"
He
listened
as
the
Cambridgeshire
sergeant
explained
that
the
keeper
on
the
shooting
estate
had
realized
he
had
seen
the
old
plough
there
last
week
and
had
fetched
the
farmer
in
to
explain
where
it
had
gone
.
"
He
says
he
never
saw
a
body
when
he
moved
it
.
He
was
very
unhappy
at
having
to
come
out
at
all
,
but
I
think
he
"
s
just
pig-ignorant
rather
than
involved
.
Do
you
want
me
to
send
someone
to
look
at
the
plough
?
"
"
Have
you
seen
it
?
"
"
No
.
I
'll
go
if
I
must
,
but
we
have
n't
got
any
forensic
people
here
,
it
being
Sunday
.
I
can
get
them
out
,
of
course
.
"
"
No
,
I
'll
send
a
couple
of
my
blokes
,
as
soon
as
I
can
.
Could
you
do
us
a
real
favour
?
Make
sure
the
vehicle
is
under
cover
so
if
there
is
anything
on
it
,
prints
,
whatever
,
that
haven
"
t
already
gone
,
we
get
them
.
I
mean
,
do
n't
let
the
farmer
clean
it
,
or
anything
dead
stupid
.
"
The
sergeant
at
the
other
end
said
grimly
that
the
bloke
was
quite
thick
enough
to
do
just
that
,
so
due
precautions
would
be
taken
.
"
I
'll
go
myself
in
fact
.
No
,
it
's
no
bother
,
it
's
on
my
way
home
.
Give
your
blokes
this
number
so
they
can
arrange
a
visit
,
but
I
'll
have
a
quick
look
while
I
'm
there
.
"
John
McLeish
was
feeling
justifiably
pleased
with
himself
as
he
walked
into
his
office
at
eight
o'clock
on
Monday
morning
.
He
had
devoted
Sunday
evening
to
making
a
plan
of
action
and
knew
exactly
what
he
and
everyone
else
he
could
press
into
service
was
going
to
be
doing
this
morning
.
His
schedule
for
the
day
was
organized
,
thanks
to
some
brisk
telephoning
the
night
before
,
and
he
would
have
Catherine
Crane
at
his
side
all
day
,
and
all
the
days
until
this
case
finished
.
He
arrived
at
his
desk
,
squinted
at
the
offering
tucked
into
his
blotter
and
sat
down
to
read
it
properly
:
a
short
,
sanctimonious
newspaper
piece
on
the
temptation
and
pressures
on
the
successful
young
,
Tristram
Wilson
being
mentioned
,
with
many
a
crocodile
tear
,
as
one
of
the
recent
casualties
.
It
was
presumably
Bruce
Davidson
,
who
admired
and
was
annoyed
by
Francesca
in
about
equal
measure
,
and
therefore
took
an
unremitting
interest
in
all
her
activities
,
who
had
favoured
him
with
this
.
McLeish
threw
it
away
and
methodically
sorted
his
notes
;
he
was
not
going
near
a
top
firm
of
solicitors
without
a
very
careful
list
of
questions
,
and
his
first
port
of
call
that
morning
was
to
be
Huttons
,
who
had
been
Angela
Morgan
's
solicitors
.
He
and
Catherine
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
Mr
Timothy
Hutton
,
who
was
housed
in
outwardly
featureless
modern
offices
in
one
of
the
little
streets
off
Ludgate
Hill
.
The
view
from
the
window
featured
a
building
site
and
a
large
collection
of
assorted
earth-moving
machinery
and
cranes
,
all
displayed
simultaneously
.
Even
through
double
glazing
there
was
a
dull
,
continuous
background
noise
,
and
the
huge
modern
windows
were
dusty
in
the
February
sun
.
The
furniture
and
fittings
were
ruthlessly
modern
,
several
steps
beyond
the
conventional
Scandinavian
.
Mr
Hutton
's
desk
was
a
shaped
piece
of
black
wood
with
a
single
file
on
it
,
and
the
heavily
bound
books
that
covered
one
wall
appeared
to
be
held
there
by
the
power
of
faith
,
no
shelves
being
visible
.
The
owner
was
also
uncompromisingly
twentieth-century
,
a
man
of
much
the
same
height
and
age
as
McLeish
but
built
like
a
string
bean
,
with
brown
,
short-cut
hair
and
fashionable
heavy
horn-rimmed
spectacles
.
He
greeted
them
briskly
and
folded
himself
into
a
chair
.
McLeish
noted
enviously
that
Mr
Hutton
was
a
vision
of
elegance
in
one
of
this
year
's
broadly
striped
blue
and
white
shirts
:
he
had
tried
one
on
himself
recently
,
and
had
been
forced
reluctantly
to
the
conclusion
that
he
looked
like
a
bouncer
for
an
East
End
club
.
"
Dreadful
thing
about
Miss
Morgan
,
"
Timothy
Hutton
said
earnestly
.
"
We
were
all
very
shocked
-
I
told
my
partners
at
prayers
this
morning
.
Sorry
,
that
's
what
we
call
the
Monday
morning
meeting
where
we
discuss
what
's
going
on
.
How
can
I
help
you
?
"
"
You
can
tell
us
,
please
,
what
Miss
Morgan
's
property
was
and
how
her
will
distributes
it
.
I
understand
that
you
are
her
executor
.
"
"
I
am
,
yes
.
With
her
father
.
I
've
just
looked
it
up
.
I
did
n't
,
of
course
,
expect
to
have
to
-
not
quite
so
soon
.
"
He
opened
the
file
and
considered
it
,
unhurriedly
and
unselfconsciously
,
and
McLeish
had
a
sudden
vision
of
an
older
Mr
Hutton
in
a
tail-coat
and
wing
collar
behind
this
modern
facade
.
"
We
have
two
wills
on
file
,
"
Timothy
Hutton
said
,
reaching
the
end
of
whatever
internal
debate
he
had
been
having
,
"
but
the
second
,
which
was
made
in
anticipation
of
her
marriage
to
Mr
Hawick
,
can
not
of
course
be
submitted
for
Probate
since
that
marriage
did
not
take
place
.
So
it
's
the
first
will
she
made
-
what
?
-
eighteen
months
ago
,
which
is
valid
.
"
McLeish
said
promptly
that
he
would
need
to
know
the
contents
of
both
wills
as
well
as
details
of
Miss
Morgan
's
estate
,
and
Timothy
Hutton
considered
him
carefully
.
"
Yes
,
I
see
you
do
,
"
he
agreed
,
"
and
I
'm
not
here
to
make
difficulties
.
Look
,
I
need
to
explain
a
bit
of
background
.
Angela
was
very
comfortably
off
.
Just
over
two
years
ago
she
benefited
very
considerably
from
the
will
of
a
chap
called
William
Coombes
,
who
was
senior
partner
in
one
of
the
second-rank
stockbrokers
.
They
do
all
right
,
those
chaps
,
even
after
taxes
.
She
got
about
two
hundred
thousand
and
a
life
interest
in
another
two
hundred
thou
.
The
family
wanted
to
dispute
the
will
,
and
that
's
when
Angela
-
Miss
Morgan
-
came
to
us
for
advice
.
Well
,
Coombes
was
only
sixty-two
when
he
died
-
it
was
a
heart
attack
,
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
his
brains
.
The
family
did
n't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
and
so
I
advised
.
They
caved
in
;
I
mean
it
was
only
a
sister
and
a
niece
,
and
they
'd
both
been
provided
for
during
his
lifetime
and
the
niece
got
a
couple
of
hundred
thou
in
his
will
.
But
the
niece
was
very
bitter
about
it
-
I
had
to
write
a
letter
to
her
solicitors
a
year
or
so
later
because
she
'd
been
bothering
Angela
long
after
the
estate
was
settled
.
"
McLeish
thought
his
way
through
this
one
,
drawing
a
diagram
on
the
edge
of
his
notes
.
"
Miss
Morgan
got
some
of
it
just
for
life
?
Who
gets
it
now
,
then
?
"
"
The
niece
,
the
one
I
've
been
telling
you
about
.
Penelope
Huntley
.
I
can
give
you
the
address
of
her
solicitors
-
Kenwards
,
two-partner
firm
in
Kensington
.
I
'll
look
for
it
.
Go
on
asking
me
things
.
"
"
How
old
is
Miss
Huntley
?
"
"
Same
age
as
Angela
.
I
agree
,
she
would
not
normally
have
expected
the
remainder
to
fall
in
and
be
useful
to
her
,
but
of
course
if
she
had
had
children
,
it
would
have
been
valuable
to
them
.
"
"
But
if
you
were
Penelope
Huntley
you
might
not
have
been
consoled
by
the
thought
that
your
children
would
inherit
after
Miss
Morgan
's
death
.
"
"
No
,
I
would
n't
.
Nor
was
she
.
"
"
Sorry
?
"
"
That
's
what
she
kept
writing
to
Angela
about
.
Her
lawyer
had
advised
her
that
she
could
,
by
agreement
with
Angela
,
break
the
trust
.
They
're
both
-
were
both
-
well
over
twenty-one
,
and
they
could
have
made
a
deal
which
essentially
bought
out
Angela
's
life
interest
for
a
capital
sum
and
then
Miss
Huntley
would
have
got
the
rest
.
"
McLeish
thought
that
it
seemed
a
reasonably
sensible
plan
.
"
Is
that
very
difficult
to
do
?
"
he
asked
,
cautiously
.
"
No
.
It
's
a
routine
valuation
exercise
based
on
actuarial
tables
.
I
do
n't
think
it
would
have
done
Miss
Huntley
a
lot
of
good
financially
though
,
given
that
Angela
was
only
twenty-nine
and
actuarially
good
for
another
forty
years
.
"
McLeish
considered
him
with
pleasure
.
His
last
interview
with
a
solicitor
had
been
conducted
in
a
language
barely
recognizable
as
English
and
it
had
taken
over
three
hours
and
a
reference
to
the
Chief
Constable
to
elicit
the
fact
that
the
deceased
had
made
a
previous
will
in
which
the
respective
positions
of
his
wife
and
his
mistress
had
been
exactly
reversed
.
As
McLeish
had
observed
to
a
colleague
at
the
ti
me
,
he
'd
have
understood
the
whole
performance
if
the
solicitor
in
question
had
been
going
to
marry
either
of
them
,
but
there
had
been
no
question
of
that
,
it
was
just
obfuscation
for
its
own
sake
.
He
decided
,
to
make
sure
he
had
this
clear
.
"
So
Miss
Morgan
would
have
got
the
lion
's
share
of
the
other
two
hundred
thousand
even
if
she
had
agreed
to
break
up
the
trust
?
Yes
?
Then
why
did
she
not
agree
to
it
?
Or
was
she
going
to
?
"
Timothy
Hutton
stopped
hunting
in
the
file
.
He
spread
both
hands
on
the
table
in
an
aid
to
thought
and
McLeish
noticed
how
long
the
fingers
were
.
"
Sorry
.
She
would
n't
do
it
at
the
time
,
because
she
felt
the
whole
issue
ought
to
be
allowed
to
settle
down
.
It
was
very
difficult
,
you
know
-
Miss
Huntley
was
bitter
and
there
was
an
extremely
unpleasant
scene
in
Kenwards
's
offices
.
The
partner
there
was
terribly
embarrassed
,
rang
me
up
and
apologized
for
hours
afterwards
,
could
n't
get
him
off
the
phone
.
So
Angela
did
n't
want
to
get
involved
-
she
did
n't
need
the
capital
,
after
all
-
and
she
said
to
me
she
might
do
it
in
a
year
or
so
when
Miss
Huntley
had
calmed
down
.
"
He
gazed
at
his
hands
,
and
visibly
played
this
back
to
himself
,
then
looked
across
at
McLeish
,
and
put
his
glasses
on
.
"
Look
,
I
'm
not
saying
Angela
actually
refused
.
Sorry
,
I
can
hear
how
it
sounds
.
She
said
-
or
rather
I
did
,
to
her
solicitors
-
that
she
would
consider
it
again
in
a
year
or
so
when
everyone
was
calmer
.
"
McLeish
flipped
back
through
his
notes
.
Catherine
was
so
quiet
that
she
might
as
well
not
have
been
in
the
room
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
must
train
her
to
make
some
unobtrusive
signal
to
him
when
she
thought
he
was
missing
something
.
"
You
said
,
Mr
Hutton
,
that
a
letter
had
been
written
.
"
Her
cool
voice
,
with
the
slight
nasal
edge
of
Stoke
on
Trent
,
came
from
behind
him
,
and
Timothy
Hutton
looked
up
sharply
.
"
Did
I
?
Well
,
yes
,
there
was
one
.
Not
to
me
,
to
Angela
,
but
she
showed
it
to
me
.
"
His
glance
towards
the
file
told
them
precisely
where
that
letter
was
and
McLeish
asked
for
it
promptly
.
Hutton
extracted
it
with
every
evidence
of
reluctance
.
"
Bit
hysterical
,
"
he
said
,
apologetically
.
Yes
,
indeed
,
McLeish
thought
,
working
his
way
through
the
letter
.
"
Is
this
a
copy
?
"
"
No
,
no
,
it
's
the
original
.
That
's
how
it
came
.
Penelope
Huntley
must
have
thought
about
it
.
Not
exactly
guaranteed
to
encourage
my
client
to
do
anything
.
"
"
What
did
you
do
?
"
"
Wrote
a
snotty
letter
to
the
poor
chap
at
Kenwards
-
I
rang
him
up
first
,
of
course
,
he
was
embarrassed
all
over
again
-
asking
him
to
ask
his
client
to
leave
mine
alone
.
I
'll
get
you
a
copy
.
"
He
reached
his
hand
for
a
bell
,
but
Catherine
's
voice
checked
him
.
"
So
,
as
matters
stand
,
that
£200,000
passes
to
Miss
Huntley
?
It
does
n't
matter
what
Miss
Morgan
's
will
says
.
"
"
Yes
,
that
's
right
.
It
is
part
of
William
Coombes
's
estate
and
passes
under
his
will
.
"
He
looked
at
her
carefully
to
see
he
had
made
himself
clear
,
then
resumed
his
search
through
the
file
.
"
You
wanted
to
know
what
was
in
Angela
's
will
-
the
one
we
're
going
to
prove
,
that
is
.
I
'll
get
you
a
copy
,
but
it
's
absolutely
straightforward
.
It
's
left
to
her
sister
,
after
decent
legacies
for
both
parents
and
small
ones
to
charity
,
and
to
her
sister
's
children
if
the
sister
predeceases
.
Sorry
,
irrelevant
now
,
of
course
.
It
's
the
sort
of
will
young
women
without
husbands
or
children
do
make
.
The
second
one
-
the
one
she
made
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
-
i-s
a
bit
more
complicated
,
but
not
much
.
Giles
Hawick
would
have
got
£100,000
outright
,
her
sister
and
various
charities
got
small
legacies
,
and
the
rest
was
to
be
in
trust
for
children
.
"
"
What
if
there
were
n't
any
?
"
"
Her
sister
Jennifer
would
have
got
it
.
"
"
Let
me
see
I
have
it
right
,
"
McLeish
said
,
after
a
pause
.
"
If
she
had
married
before
she
died
,
the
sister
would
only
have
got
a
small
legacy
.
But
Miss
Huntley
would
still
inherit
£200,000
on
Miss
Morgan
's
death
,
whenever
that
happened
.
"
Timothy
Hutton
nodded
and
took
his
glasses
off
,
and
McLeish
realized
that
he
did
n't
actually
need
them
.
"
You
have
n't
asked
me
what
's
in
the
estate
,
and
I
've
got
a
list
of
assets
here
.
"
He
passed
it
over
the
table
,
and
courteously
got
up
to
give
Catherine
a
second
copy
.
The
problem
item
appeared
right
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
,
in
what
McLeish
decided
was
characteristic
legal
style
-
you
did
n't
hide
it
,
you
just
put
it
last
,
after
the
long
respectable
list
of
£20,000
ICI
loan
stock
,
and
7,000
25p
shares
in
Sainsbury
.
"
This
is
a
loan
of
£100,000
to
Yeo
Davis
?
Her
employers
?
"
"
Well
,
it
's
the
amount
she
was
asked
to
put
up
when
she
became
a
partner
last
year
.
"
"
Is
that
usual
?
"
"
Difficult
to
say
.
"
Timothy
Hutton
was
looking
uncomfortable
and
McLeish
said
that
it
just
seemed
a
lot
to
him
.
"
I
mean
,
I
imagine
a
lot
of
people
might
have
difficulty
raising
that
much
?
"
"
Yes
and
no
.
She
drew
something
like
£30,000
from
the
partnership
last
year
.
People
can
borrow
on
that
.
But
I
did
think
it
was
a
lot
,
and
I
tell
you
why
:
I
ca
n't
really
see
what
a
group
of
professionals
charging
fees
like
that
needs
cash
for
.
When
we
started
here
we
only
put
in
about
£100,000
between
four
of
us
,
to
keep
us
going
till
the
fees
came
in
,
and
that
was
more
than
enough
.
And
Yeo
Davis
charge
a
good
deal
more
than
we
do
,
I
can
tell
you
.
In
some
sense
Angela
may
have
been
paying
for
the
assets
-
they
had
assets
valued
at
£600,000
then
,
most
of
it
in
the
lease
on
the
building
.
But
you
usually
deal
with
that
by
giving
new
partners
uneven
shares
.
Say
the
profits
come
out
at
£500,000
,
then
senior
partner
gets
£200,000
,
second
partner
£100,000
and
so
on
.
It
's
not
usual
to
make
new
partners
put
up
a
lot
of
cash
.
"
McLeish
contemplated
this
and
decided
he
would
have
to
find
out
more
about
Yeo
Davis
's
financial
affairs
.
"
What
happens
to
that
loan
now
?
"
It
was
Catherine
again
and
McLeish
was
mildly
irritated
by
the
way
she
seemed
to
be
ahead
of
him
.
"
I
'm
looking
at
the
partnership
agreement
now
-
trm
,
trm
,
trm
,
here
we
are
-
death
in
partnership
-
well
,
it
dissolves
the
partnership
,
course
it
does
,
but
what
happens
to
the
money
?
Ah
yes
,
the
partnership
has
a
year
to
give
it
back
.
I
remember
saying
this
was
a
bit
leisurely
,
was
n't
it
,
but
there
was
some
apparently
reasonable
explanation
,
like
no
one
gave
any
notice
that
they
were
going
to
die
and
the
partnership
could
be
a
bit
pushed
to
produce
the
cash
if
it
was
the
wrong
time
of
year
.
And
of
course
none
of
us
were
particularly
exercised
about
death
as
a
real
possibility
.
As
executor
,
I
'll
ask
for
it
back
formally
,
but
I
wo
n't
hold
my
breath
.
It
's
interest-free
,
so
I
'd
expect
to
get
it
in
eleven
months
and
twenty-nine
days
from
giving
notice
.
"
The
phone
rang
and
Hutton
picked
it
up
,
glancing
at
his
watch
.
"
Yes
,
yes
I
know
.
I
'll
be
along
as
soon
as
I
can
-
what
,
five
minutes
?
"
He
looked
enquiringly
at
McLeish
.
"
Fine
.
"
He
banged
the
phone
down
briskly
and
sat
,
clearly
working
out
what
else
he
could
offer
to
get
them
to
go
.
Amused
,
McLeish
said
that
he
would
be
happy
to
wait
in
an
outer
office
for
copies
of
the
various
documents
,
or
to
have
them
sent
on
.
"
What
would
happen
if
anyone
just
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
partnership
-
I
mean
,
without
a
death
being
involved
?
"
McLeish
asked
,
as
they
stood
up
.
"
Six
months
'
notice
,
both
ways
,
and
any
loans
repaid
within
that
period
.
Pretty
much
a
standard
period
.
Lots
of
provisions
against
stealing
clients
subsequently
,
of
course
.
"
As
Timothy
Hutton
's
attention
was
openly
on
whatever
his
next
problem
was
,
McLeish
decided
to
leave
,
and
to
extract
anything
else
he
needed
from
the
documents
.
He
did
now
at
least
know
roughly
what
was
in
them
.
In
the
event
,
they
went
back
to
Scotland
Yard
so
that
McLeish
could
get
to
a
phone
and
check
with
his
secretary
,
and
with
Bruce
Davidson
,
who
was
co-ordinating
the
evidence
as
it
came
in
.
"
Forensic
rang
,
"
Bruce
reported
dourly
.
"
The
autopsy
report
is
on
its
way
,
so
they
say
,
usual
rubbish
about
typing
difficulties
.
He
wanted
to
speak
to
you
but
I
said
you
had
a
string
of
interviews
,
so
he
coughed
up
to
me
,
nae
bother
.
Killed
by
a
bang
on
the
head
from
behind
,
massive
bleeding
inside
the
brain
.
Small
contusion
on
the
right
cheek
as
well
.
He
went
on
a
while
about
the
various
tests
but
where
he
came
out
was
that
she
'd
been
dead
for
at
least
five
days
,
and
seven
was
perfectly
possible
.
Nae
bloody
use
at
all
.
"
McLeish
silently
agreed
with
that
judgement
.
That
left
at
least
forty-eight
hours
from
Angela
Morgan
's
disappearance
when
,
as
far
as
the
forensic
evidence
went
,
she
could
have
been
alive
.
It
was
in
his
experience
difficult
for
most
people
to
prove
conclusively
exactly
where
they
had
been
for
any
forty-eight-hour
period
,
members
of
the
Metropolitan
police
force
always
excepted
,
and
this
was
going
to
make
his
life
very
difficult
.
"
You
find
anything
useful
from
the
scene-of-crime
report
?
I
never
got
beyond
page
two
this
morning
.
"
"
Not
a
thing
.
No
weapon
,
no
footprints
,
no
fingerprints
,
all
the
bits
of
fibre
caught
on
bushes
came
from
the
deceased
's
clothes
.
"
"
A
clever
one
.
Car
tracks
?
"
"
Yes
.
"
"
What
do
you
mean
,
yes
?
"
"
Lots
of
them
.
Traces
of
at
least
a
dozen
different
cars
up
that
wee
track
that
leads
back
to
the
road
,
and
of
two
or
three
heavy
vehicles
,
all
very
deeply
indented
.
The
lads
tell
me
it
's
a
shooting
estate
-
likely
that
's
where
people
leave
their
cars
.
"
"
Oh
Christ
.
"
"
Well
,
someone
knew
that
,
did
n't
they
,
John
?
"
"
Yes
.
Yes
,
of
course
they
did
.
We
have
got
a
clever
one
here
.
I
'll
be
in
later
,
after
six
.
Hang
on
.
"
He
picked
up
his
phone
to
find
the
Cambridgeshire
sergeant
to
whom
he
had
spoken
the
day
before
on
the
line
.
"
I
only
did
n't
ring
last
night
because
I
could
n't
find
you
,
sir
.
Your
blokes
are
on
their
way
,
but
there
are
definitely
bits
of
blood
and
hair
on
one
of
the
metal
parts
of
this
thing
-
the
truss
,
the
bloke
here
says
.
Could
she
have
fallen
on
it
?
"
"
Jesus
Christ
.
Well
done
,
Sergeant
,
thank
you
very
much
.
You
have
n't
touched
it
-
no
,
sorry
,
course
you
have
n't
.
I
take
it
it
's
not
something
a
murderer
could
pick
up
?
No
,
I
thought
not
.
"
The
voice
at
the
other
end
warmed
.
"
I
was
surprised
too
,
sir
,
you
know
.
I
only
looked
for
the
sake
of
form
.
I
took
a
picture
last
night
and
put
a
plastic
bag
on
and
told
the
farmer
we
were
n't
going
to
put
him
in
jail
here
and
now
.
He
can
account
for
his
movements
,
as
it
happens
.
He
was
in
Northumberland
with
the
wife
's
mother
for
ten
days
,
only
got
back
three
days
ago
.
Well
,
she
's
been
dead
longer
than
that
,
has
n't
she
?
"
"
He
still
around
?
"
"
Yes
,
that
's
the
point
.
He
's
a
bit
upset
,
and
he
does
n't
need
to
be
.
I
'll
tell
him
-
I
think
that
's
your
blokes
now
,
I
'll
get
them
to
ring
you
.
"
McLeish
put
down
the
phone
,
heavily
.
"
She
fell
back
on
it
,
assuming
it
's
her
blood
.
"
"
Accident
?
"
Bruce
Davidson
said
,
and
McLeish
gave
it
thought
.
"
No
.
How
did
she
get
there
?
There
must
have
been
someone
else
around
.
Unless
she
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
embankment
-
I
suppose
it
's
possible
,
but
she
ca
n't
have
walked
to
the
spot
in
the
first
place
.
"
He
gazed
at
his
subordinate
.
"
This
is
silly
.
We
'll
wait
for
the
lads
up
there
to
tell
us
about
the
blood
and
we
'll
read
the
autopsy
report
.
What
else
can
we
do
while
we
"
re
waiting
?
"
"
One
of
the
appointments
we
found
in
Miss
Morgan
's
diary
was
with
a
Miss
Huntley
.
She
was
due
to
have
lunch
with
Miss
Morgan
last
week
apparently
-
she
is
on
the
phone
,
I
looked
.
Did
n't
want
to
talk
to
me
,
so
I
told
her
she
'd
have
to
wait
.
"
Miss
Huntley
?
McLeish
thought
.
Ah
yes
,
the
hysterical
Penelope
,
niece
of
the
late
William
Coombes
.
"
Now
,
her
I
do
want
to
see
.
Fix
a
date
for
tomorrow
,
Bruce
.
Anything
else
?
"
"
Aye
,
a
wee
message
from
one
of
Francesca
's
young
men
at
the
Department
.
She
's
been
delayed
-
she
does
n't
think
she
'll
get
back
to
London
until
Thursday
,
now
.
Sorry
to
bring
you
more
bad
news
.
"
McLeish
grunted
,
feeling
meanly
triumphant
that
he
had
turned
out
to
be
right
in
his
view
that
Francesca
would
not
be
able
to
sweep
Tristram
out
of
the
hands
of
the
New
York
police
in
quite
the
Napoleonic
way
she
had
assumed
.
And
he
had
been
perfectly
justified
,
he
assured
himself
smugly
,
in
cancelling
their
holiday
plans
at
once
-
she
had
never
been
going
to
get
back
on
time
.
Feeling
vindicated
and
far-seeing
,
he
strode
off
to
collect
Catherine
and
finish
his
coffee
.
Over
at
the
Department
of
Trade
and
Industry
the
news
that
Francesca
would
not
be
back
before
Thursday
morning
was
being
received
with
open
dismay
.
Bill
Westland
CB
,
MC
,
the
fifty-five-year-old
Deputy
Secretary
responsible
for
both
personnel
matters
and
regional
policy
,
cursed
heartily
.
He
summoned
his
junior
,
Rajiv
Sengupta
,
a
rising
star
of
thirty-six
who
had
the
job
of
co-ordinating
financial
assistance
to
industry
in
the
regions
,
to
worry
with
him
.
He
derived
some
comfort
from
Rajiv
's
habitual
elegance
;
wearing
a
suit
,
shirt
and
tie
that
must
have
cost
two
months
of
his
salary
as
an
Assistant
Under-Secretary
of
State
,
he
was
sitting
at
the
other
side
of
the
large
,
uncompromising
desk
that
the
Department
provides
for
its
most
senior
officials
,
not
a
hair
out
of
place
and
his
black
eyes
alive
with
amusement
.
"
What
are
we
going
to
do
with
Professor
Thornton
tomorrow
?
"
Bill
Westland
appealed
,
hopelessly
.
"
You
and
I
and
Henry
will
be
with
the
Minister
at
the
Select
Committee
all
afternoon
,
and
we
'll
have
to
be
on
call
to
brief
all
morning
.
I
was
depending
on
Francesca
to
look
after
Thornton
,
and
give
him
lunch
and
introduce
him
around
,
since
she
'll
be
working
with
him
.
"
"
Why
is
Francesca
delayed
?
"
Rajiv
asked
.
"
Some
problem
with
the
New
York
legal
system
.
Or
she
's
staying
to
thank
O'Brien
personally
-
I
really
do
n't
know
.
"
"
You
do
n't
seem
to
have
much
control
of
your
god-daughter
.
"
"
None
whatsoever
,
as
well
you
know
,
Rajiv
.
You
're
no
use
either
,
and
you
taught
her
for
three
years
at
Cambridge
.
Never
mind
that
:
at
ten
o'clock
tomorrow
we
have
Professor
Thornton
,
distinguished
economist
,
Oxford
don
and
friend
of
the
Prime
Minister
,
here
for
five
weeks
to
do
a
study
on
how
effective
regional
assistance
is
,
and
we
have
no
one
to
meet
him
.
Now
what
do
we
do
?
"
"
Send
him
to
a
regional
office
?
"
Rajiv
offered
.
"
Without
someone
from
here
to
look
after
him
?
Heaven
forbid
.
"
"
Give
him
to
the
Chief
Statistician
?
"
"
To
Gerhard
?
Even
if
we
get
him
to
comb
his
hair
,
it
'll
be
too
much
of
a
shock
for
Professor
Thornton
.
"
"
Oh
come
now
,
Bill
,
Oxford
senior
common
rooms
are
full
of
people
quite
as
untidy
and
generally
as
odd
as
Gerhard
.
Last
ti
me
I
dined
at
Balliol
I
sat
next
to
the
Regius
Professor
of
Chemistry
,
aged
around
193
,
who
told
me
about
his
visit
to
Egypt
before
the
war
,
probably
the
Boer
War
.
His
teeth
did
n't
fit
awfully
well
,
so
I
could
n't
be
sure
.
Gerhard
is
at
least
intelligible
.
"
Bill
Westland
,
grinned
,
sidetracked
.
"
You
know
the
story
about
Gerhard
,
looking
as
he
usually
does
,
standing
on
the
steps
of
Horseguards
after
a
Cabinet
Committee
,
when
a
kindly
person
sidled
up
to
him
and
gave
him
a
quid
to
buy
himself
breakfast
?
"
"
I
have
always
assumed
it
to
be
apocryphal
.
"
"
Not
at
all
,
dear
boy
,
I
was
there
.
Gerhard
thought
it
a
charming
example
of
English
eccentricity
and
placed
the
quid
tenderly
in
the
mince-stained
pocket
of
whatever
Oxfam-reject
he
was
wearing
.
I
suppose
it
's
not
a
bad
idea
to
get
him
to
entertain
Thornton
.
"
He
seized
the
telephone
,
and
,
ruthlessly
disrupting
Sir
Gerhard
's
morning
,
imposed
a
guest
on
him
for
lunch
.
"
In
the
afternoon
the
good
Professor
Thornton
can
come
and
watch
us
and
the
Minister
defending
the
assistance
given
to
Willis
Engineering
,
"
Rajiv
pointed
out
,
eyes
bright
with
malice
,
and
Bill
Westland
winced
.
"
It
is
,
of
course
,
precisely
what
he
ought
to
be
seeing
,
"
he
agreed
,
reluctantly
.
"
As
an
expose
of
the
soft
underbelly
of
our
policy
on
regional
assistance
,
Willis
Engineering
has
no
equal
.
I
suppose
so
,
Rajiv
,
I
suppose
so
,
but
he
is
not
to
come
to
the
briefing
.
Then
what
?
"
"
Well
,
by
Wednesday
I
'm
clear
of
the
Committee
,
and
I
could
take
him
to
a
Regional
Office
.
If
I
must
.
"
"
Yes
,
you
must
,
but
not
Birmingham
.
After
last
week
's
announcement
that
its
development-area
status
is
being
removed
,
the
staff
are
all
cowering
under
their
desks
while
the
population
throw
bricks
through
the
windows
.
What
about
Manchester
-
virtually
everyone
there
has
applied
for
selective
financial
assistance
?
Can
you
keep
him
there
overnight
?
Good
,
then
Francesca
can
do
the
honours
from
Thursday
and
work
for
him
thereafter
.
She
's
got
the
troops
and
it
's
right
up
her
street
,
she
can
get
on
with
anyone
.
"
"
What
age
of
man
is
he
?
"
"
Mm
,
hang
on
.
Fifty-two
,
married
to
an
American
,
four
children
but
three
are
steps
,
girls
;
his
own
boy
is
only
eight
.
Fellow
of
Balliol
,
went
to
Harvard
in
his
late
thirties
,
came
back
five
years
ago
.
Lots
and
lots
of
long
,
distinguished
,
incomprehensible
books
on
econometrics
.
"
"
Frannie
's
maths
was
never
any
good
,
"
Rajiv
warned
.
"
This
may
be
beyond
her
.
"
"
She
'll
find
a
way
,
"
her
godfather
said
,
with
perfect
confidence
.
"
I
just
wish
she
was
here
now
.
I
've
got
enough
to
worry
about
without
Professor
Thornton
.
"
Interesting
that
the
offices
of
Yeo
Davis
should
be
very
much
less
at
the
leading
edge
of
modern
design
than
the
solicitors
'
which
they
had
just
seen
,
McLeish
thought
,
and
murmured
as
much
to
Catherine
Crane
,
who
laughed
.
"
It
's
like
all
the
Italian
restaurants
used
to
be
,
is
n't
it
?
Lots
of
black
and
white
tiles
and
plants
and
arches
.
"
McLeish
was
considering
the
possible
relationship
between
design
and
organizational
style
when
Peter
Yeo
himself
came
down
to
fetch
them
.
"
Nice
to
meet
you
,
Chief
Inspector
,
"
he
said
with
automatic
politeness
,
then
considered
what
he
had
just
said
,
decided
it
was
beyond
explanation
and
led
them
upstairs
to
his
office
.
This
echoed
the
prevailing
Italian-restaurant
theme
,
except
for
the
large
comfortable
mahogany
desk
which
featured
reassuring
and
recognizable
objects
like
drawers
and
blotters
.
Peter
Yeo
himself
was
an
old-fashioned
and
recognizable
object
,
McLeish
thought
,
seeing
him
against
the
rapidly
fading
light
from
the
window
.
It
had
been
Bruce
Davidson
who
had
interviewed
Yeo
before
,
when
Angela
Morgan
had
still
been
officially
only
a
Missing
Person
and
Peter
Yeo
,
as
her
employer
,
one
of
the
obvious
people
to
talk
to
about
where
she
might
be
.
He
considered
him
as
he
caused
coffee
to
be
produced
and
established
them
at
the
big
table
at
the
other
end
of
his
room
.
Given
a
choice
,
you
would
have
taken
him
rather
than
Timothy
Hutton
for
a
solicitor
.
With
his
conventional
double-breasted
suit
,
carefully
cut
to
disguise
a
distinctly
stocky
figure
,
and
his
watchful
courtesy
he
was
in
sharp
contrast
to
Hutton
's
hard-edged
efficiency
.
The
difference
was
partly
generational
;
this
man
must
be
ten
years
older
than
Hutton
.
The
real
distinction
however
,
McLeish
thought
in
a
flash
of
revelation
,
lay
in
their
clients
'
expectations
.
Yeo
Davis
's
business
was
concerned
with
representing
people
who
did
not
know
the
ropes
,
or
even
that
there
were
any
ropes
;
Hutton
's
predominantly
with
fellow
professionals
in
other
fields
who
just
wanted
the
best
and
swiftest
way
through
.
So
Peter
Yeo
had
to
look
reassuring
and
solid
and
a
bit
older
,
while
Timothy
Hutton
could
probably
have
come
to
work
in
striped
organza
without
losing
a
single
client
.
He
abandoned
this
line
of
observation
and
looked
carefully
at
the
man
inside
the
suit
.
The
impression
of
suppressed
energy
which
he
had
received
as
he
arrived
was
intensified
;
Peter
Yeo
could
barely
sit
still
and
was
discharging
tension
by
moving
papers
on
his
desk
,
then
fiddling
with
the
Venetian
blinds
to
prevent
the
sun
from
shining
in
Catherine
's
eyes
.
The
bright
blue
eyes
looked
a
bit
bloodshot
,
and
there
was
a
flush
of
colour
across
the
cheekbones
.
Yeo
rubbed
the
back
of
his
neck
irritably
,
and
reached
for
his
coffee
,
downing
two
cups
while
McLeish
and
Catherine
Crane
were
still
passing
each
other
milk
and
sugar
.
A
thick
weekend
,
McLeish
decided
,
trying
to
think
how
best
to
establish
what
Yeo
's
relationship
had
been
with
the
dead
girl
.
He
started
,
as
he
had
intended
,
from
where
the
last
interview
had
left
off
and
went
quickly
over
the
ground
again
.
"
Last
Friday
,
yes
,
ten
days
ago
,
was
the
last
time
I
saw
her
,
"
Yeo
confirmed
.
"
Around
five
o'clock
-
she
left
early
because
she
was
meeting
Giles
.
Giles
Hawick
,
yes
.
She
was
spending
the
night
with
him
before
he
went
off
for
a
walking
weekend
in
Derbyshire
.
She
did
n't
want
to
go
with
him
because
she
had
too
much
to
do
,
what
with
the
wedding
.
As
I
told
you
,
I
did
n't
particularly
take
in
her
plans
for
the
weekend
,
you
know
how
one
does
n't
,
one
just
asks
to
be
civil
and
does
n't
listen
properly
to
the
answer
.
"
He
met
McLeish
's
eye
and
blinked
.
"
That
must
sound
remarkably
silly
to
a
policeman
.
Sorry
,
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
still
baffled
by
all
this
.
What
on
earth
can
have
happened
?
I
understand
she
was
found
not
all
that
far
from
her
parents
'
house
?
But
she
was
n't
planning
to
go
to
her
parents
-
I
know
because
I
rang
them
on
Tuesday
when
she
still
had
n't
turned
up
.
"
"
I
wondered
if
she
might
have
come
into
the
office
on
the
Saturday
?
"
"
Not
while
I
was
here
.
I
was
in
-
oh
,
from
about
ten
o'clock
to
well
after
lunch
,
and
I
would
n't
have
thought
she
would
come
in
late
in
the
afternoon
.
I
mean
,
it
's
not
a
bad
idea
,
Chief
Inspector
.
She
often
was
in
on
Saturday
.
We
own
the
building
and
all
the
partners
have
keys
,
so
unless
someone
else
was
here
she
could
have
been
in
and
out
without
anyone
noticing
.
"
"
I
see
.
You
left
at
what
time
?
"
"
Well
,
about
three
.
I
was
going
to
have
lunch
with
a
client
but
it
got
cancelled
,
so
I
just
stayed
here
.
There
's
a
kitchen
here
,
we
have
a
girl
who
comes
in
and
cooks
lunch
during
the
week
and
there
's
always
cheese
and
things
around
.
I
killed
a
rather
good
bottle
of
Fleurie
,
as
I
remember
it
.
I
went
to
the
flicks
-
I
wanted
to
see
Some
Like
It
Hot
for
about
the
tenth
time
and
it
was
being
revived
at
Baker
Street
.
I
knew
my
wife
did
n't
want
to
see
it
at
all
.
Then
I
came
back
here
to
change
,
before
I
joined
my
wife
at
a
dinner
party
.
Angie
was
n't
here
then
,
either
.
"
"
What
about
Sunday
?
Did
you
go
to
the
office
?
"
"
No
,
I
did
n't
.
We
spent
the
day
with
friends
.
"
That
left
a
large
space
of
time
on
Saturday
where
there
was
little
possibility
of
establishing
that
Peter
Yeo
had
been
where
he
said
he
was
.
But
the
man
himself
seemed
to
be
unconcerned
about
this
.
"
One
or
other
of
my
partners
is
usually
in
the
office
on
a
Saturday
.
It
happened
that
none
of
them
were
,
last
week
.
In
fact
it
's
so
regular
that
Fiona
-
that
's
the
girl
who
does
our
weekday
lunches
-
is
under
instructions
to
leave
something
we
can
eat
for
Saturday
lunch
.
"
"
Do
you
tell
her
how
many
are
likely
to
be
here
?
"
Catherine
had
decided
to
ask
a
question
.
Yeo
thought
about
it
.
"
Depends
-
I
mean
,
if
I
knew
I
had
a
team
coming
of
course
I
'd
tell
her
.
But
otherwise
I
just
reckon
there
will
be
something
around
-
or
if
the
locusts
have
been
at
the
fridge
,
well
,
I
can
always
go
out
.
"
"
Can
you
remember
what
you
ate
?
"
Peter
Yeo
considered
her
,
as
the
reason
for
her
question
sank
in
.
"
Actually
I
can
.
I
had
an
enormous
slice
of
quiche
that
was
left
over
from
Friday
.
I
felt
afterwards
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
make
such
an
effort
to
finish
it
all
.
Fiona
will
probably
remember
.
"
He
sounded
mildly
offended
but
not
in
the
slightest
bit
rattled
.
"
I
think
Some
Like
It
Hot
started
around
three-thirty
but
I
ca
n't
quite
remember
.
I
walked
down
-
it
's
not
far
,
and
I
was
feeling
rather
full
of
quiche
.
"
That
will
check
,
McLeish
thought
,
of
course
it
will
,
someone
just
has
to
do
it
all
.
That
means
at
some
stage
we
may
have
to
see
Mrs
Yeo
.
In
fact
,
he
decided
,
he
would
be
interested
to
see
a
wife
who
accepted
with
such
apparent
equanimity
her
husband
's
absence
on
a
Saturday
.
Presumably
,
however
,
the
senior
partner
in
Yeo
Davis
was
hardly
needed
to
do
the
odd
household
chore
.
Which
brought
him
to
consider
the
Yeo
Davis
partnership
;
how
did
it
work
?
How
important
to
it
had
Angela
Morgan
been
?
He
decided
to
start
as
softly
as
possible
.
"
Groups
like
yours
are
a
bit
outside
my
experience
,
"
he
confided
,
"
and
I
need
to
understand
a
bit
about
what
Miss
Morgan
did
for
a
living
.
Could
you
tell
me
,
perhaps
with
an
example
?
"
He
observed
from
the
way
peter
Yeo
gathered
himself
and
sat
up
straight
that
he
was
on
familiar
territory
,
and
understood
further
that
the
general
patter
was
well
rehearsed
.
It
was
,
for
obvious
reasons
,
a
great
deal
less
incisive
than
Francesca
's
summary
,
but
the
same
skeleton
was
recognizable
under
the
attractive
padding
placed
round
it
by
Peter
Yeo
.
Much
emphasis
was
put
on
the
importance
of
identifying
the
key
decision-takers
and
making
sure
that
they
had
the
right
information
-
much
was
made
of
the
necessity
of
their
getting
a
balanced
picture
on
which
to
take
their
decisions
.
"
Ours
is
not
unlike
the
job
of
a
good
barrister
,
"
Peter
Yeo
observed
,
reaching
a
peroration
.
"
We
try
to
make
sure
the
judge
has
all
the
facts
before
arriving
at
a
decision
.
Mostly
we
do
this
by
ensuring
that
our
client
gets
to
talk
to
the
decision-takers
.
There
is
no
point
at
all
in
my
talking
to
those
people
,
except
on
a
preliminary
basis
;
they
're
not
that
interested
in
my
views
.
I
do
the
background
briefing
but
the
clients
have
to
do
most
of
the
work
,
and
so
I
always
tell
them
.
"
McLeish
decided
this
was
good
stuff
from
which
,
but
for
Francesca
,
he
would
have
gained
no
clear
idea
of
what
a
firm
like
Yeo
's
was
really
for
.
"
So
you
would
,
for
instance
,
have
lunch
with
people
in
government
departments
to
talk
to
them
about
particular
policies
.
"
"
Yes
,
often
that
is
the
best
way
to
start
.
We
've
got
a
lot
of
friends
whom
we
can
talk
to
about
a
policy
generally
,
and
where
we
can
put
a
word
in
.
Let
me
try
and
think
of
an
example
that
is
n't
confidential
.
Yes
.
One
of
our
clients
is
Andy
Barton
,
who
runs
the
biggest
textile
group
in
the
north-west
.
Well
,
the
DTI
is
at
this
moment
considering
giving
money
to
keep
Huerter
,
one
of
his
main
rivals
,
going
.
A
Conservative
government
,
if
you
believe
their
manifesto
,
ought
not
even
to
be
considering
putting
money
into
dying
private-sector
firms
,
but
Huerter
employ
a
lot
of
people
,
many
of
whom
voted
for
this
government
.
One
of
the
last
things
Angela
did
was
to
have
lunch
with
an
old
schoolfriend
in
the
DTI
who
is
responsible
for
the
Huerter
case
,
to
make
sure
the
DTI
understood
the
impact
of
such
assistance
on
Barton
's
operations
.
"
"
And
did
it
?
"
McLeish
asked
.
"
Oh
yes
,
but
Angela
was
clear
that
the
civil
servants
were
going
nonetheless
to
recommend
assisting
Huerter
.
They
've
been
rescuing
companies
for
so
long
they
do
it
automatically
now
,
I
expect
.
So
that
told
us
that
we
had
better
get
a
full-scale
defence
working
immediately
.
"
McLeish
,
who
had
understood
from
Francesca
's
report
of
her
lunch
that
she
and
her
seniors
were
indeed
going
to
push
for
assistance
,
was
amused
to
hear
that
she
had
not
succeeded
in
disguising
her
intentions
from
Miss
Morgan
.
"
Can
you
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
advise
your
client
now
?
I
mean
,
what
is
a
full-scale
defence
?
"
"
Ah
,
well
it
varies
.
I
've
got
Andy
Barton
in
to
see
the
Minister
responsible
at
the
DTI
.
I
'm
keeping
the
Secretary
of
State
-
that
's
the
top
man
-
in
reserve
.
And
,
of
course
,
we
are
arranging
to
brief
Treasury
people
,
who
will
automatically
be
opposed
to
giving
away
public
money
;
and
we
are
working
with
the
company
on
a
memorandum
on
what
assistance
to
Huerter
would
do
to
Barton
,
with
a
two-page
bullet-point
summary
.
Politicians
do
n't
have
time
to
read
screeds
,
so
you
have
to
give
them
short
,
pithy
things
to
look
at
,
We
were
doing
all
this
anyway
,
of
course
,
but
the
chaps
at
Barton
,
including
Andy
,
are
working
on
it
much
more
effectively
since
we
were
able
to
say
definitely
that
the
DTI
civil
servants
were
agin
them
.
These
chaps
,
good
blokes
who
've
spent
all
their
lives
running
businesses
,
believed
the
government
manifesto
and
thought
that
if
they
shouted
loud
enough
in
the
local
paper
,
Whitehall
would
crumble
and
right
would
prevail
.
It
's
a
bit
more
difficult
than
that
.
"
That
lunch
had
,
in
fact
,
given
a
considerable
spur
to
a
campaign
being
waged
against
the
policy
Francesca
and
her
colleagues
wanted
,
McLeish
observed
.
The
point
of
Yeo
Davis
was
now
clear
:
they
were
there
to
inform
,
inspire
,
and
orchestrate
a
client
's
efforts
to
get
what
he
wanted
,
as
efficiently
as
possible
.
"
I
've
read
about
people
giving
MPs
expensive
lunches
,
"
he
said
,
with
interest
.
"
Waste
of
time
,
"
Peter
Yeo
said
briskly
.
"
The
good
ones
do
n't
have
time
for
long
drunken
lunches
,
and
you
get
better
results
by
getting
them
to
give
you
and
the
client
a
sandwich
in
a
bar
at
six
p.m
.
The
ones
you
can
get
for
lunch
-
there
are
plenty
-
will
likely
forget
every
word
you
tell
them
,
and
they
certainly
do
n't
feel
obliged
to
help
.
"
He
caught
McLeish
's
eye
.
"
Sorry
,
but
the
fact
is
the
average
backbench
MP
does
n't
know
anything
,
unlike
the
average
civil
servant
who
really
does
know
about
his
or
her
particular
area
.
It
's
only
worth
using
MPs
to
have
a
go
at
the
government
,
and
then
you
spoon-feed
it
to
them
.
"
The
man
had
come
to
life
very
considerably
in
discussing
his
job
and
a
formidable
personality
was
emerging
.
McLeish
decided
he
would
have
to
abandon
any
prejudice
taken
from
Francesca
about
this
trade
;
Peter
Yeo
knew
his
business
and
was
obviously
effective
.
And
it
was
a
good
thing
Yeo
Davis
existed
;
McLeish
himself
had
often
been
quietly
riled
by
the
intellectual
scorn
which
Francesca
and
her
colleagues
would
bring
to
bear
on
criticism
of
some
of
their
more
sweeping
policies
.
It
might
well
have
been
necessary
to
invent
Yeo
Davis
if
they
had
n't
already
existed
.
He
reminded
himself
that
he
was
talking
to
the
inventor
of
the
firm
and
decided
to
prod
a
bit
further
.
"
How
long
have
you
been
in
this
field
?
"
"
I
've
spent
all
my
life
in
general
PR
,
but
it
was
about
eight
years
ago
I
decided
that
there
was
room
for
a
specialist
agency
,
not
really
a
PR
firm
,
which
was
concerned
entirely
with
government
relations
.
Government
in
the
widest
sense
,
including
our
masters
in
Brussels
.
I
have
-
-
had
-
four
partners
,
and
we
have
another
twenty
people
working
for
us
.
"
McLeish
glanced
at
the
clock
on
Yeo
's
desk
and
saw
that
he
was
running
behind
ti
me
,
as
tended
to
happen
at
this
stage
in
an
investigation
when
you
needed
to
be
in
six
places
at
once
.
He
considered
his
notes
;
what
he
needed
from
this
interview
was
to
confirm
that
Angela
Morgan
had
not
been
in
the
office
on
Saturday
,
and
a
statement
of
Peter
Yeo
's
movements
over
the
period
within
which
Angela
Morgan
had
probably
been
killed
.
He
also
did
need
to
understand
the
financial
side
.
"
Was
Miss
Morgan
about
the
same
age
as
the
rest
of
your
partners
?
"
"
No
,
no
,
she
was
the
youngest
by
a
good
five
years
.
She
is
-
was
-
outstandingly
able
,
that
's
why
I
asked
her
to
join
us
.
"
McLeish
noted
the
absence
of
reference
to
the
other
partners
.
Yeo
Davis
,
evidently
,
c'est
moi
as
far
as
Peter
Yeo
was
concerned
.
"
I
'd
like
to
confirm
what
the
financial
arrangements
were
.
I
mean
how
much
did
she
get
paid
,
and
how
much
capital
was
she
asked
to
put
up
,
that
sort
of
thing
.
"
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
you
do
.
Well
,
you
understand
about
partnerships
,
do
you
?
None
of
the
partners
here
is
actually
entitled
to
a
salary
;
in
theory
we
split
the
profits
in
accordance
with
a
formula
that
we
fix
annually
and
that
takes
account
of
age
,
and
experience
and
what
people
are
contributing
in
terms
of
work
or
clients
.
As
a
matter
of
practice
,
and
because
we
've
all
got
to
live
,
we
all
draw
about
two-thirds
of
what
we
would
have
got
last
year
as
we
go
along
,
then
share
out
the
rest
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
"
McLeish
contemplated
this
system
and
its
possible
application
to
the
Metropolitan
police
force
and
felt
imagination
boggle
.
He
himself
would
have
been
desperately
pushed
if
he
had
had
to
manage
on
two-thirds
of
his
salary
until
Christmas
every
year
.
A
moment
's
thought
told
him
that
this
system
worked
only
because
two-thirds
of
the
expected
total
of
a
Yeo
Davis
partnership
came
out
at
an
amount
well
in
excess
of
his
salary
,
or
that
of
any
public
servant
of
his
age
.
He
asked
what
Angela
Morgan
had
been
drawing
on
every
month
and
found
his
belief
confirmed
.
Christmas
must
be
worth
having
at
Yeo
Davis
.
"
What
about
tax
?
"
he
asked
,
still
considering
the
mechanics
of
the
system
.
"
All
partners
are
technically
self-employed
but
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
getting
into
a
frightful
mess
we
deduct
a
percentage
from
their
drawings
,
so
there
is
something
put
aside
for
tax
.
I
'd
have
to
say
it
's
a
great
deal
lower
percentage
than
most
employed
people
pay
because
there
are
all
sorts
of
expenses
a
partnership
can
claim
.
If
we
seem
to
have
got
it
wrong
,
we
sort
it
out
when
we
divvy
up
the
profit
.
"
McLeish
made
a
conscientious
note
,
feeling
that
he
had
got
himself
sidetracked
off
the
more
interesting
question
of
Angela
Morgan
's
capital
investment
in
Yeo
Davis
.
Finding
no
way
other
than
the
direct
question
,
he
put
it
,
and
watched
Yeo
,
unruffled
,
confirm
that
she
had
indeed
put
up
£100,000
.
"
The
rest
of
us
had
put
up
much
the
same
,
given
that
we
had
done
it
earlier
,
"
he
assured
McLeish
.
"
It
seems
a
lot
,
but
we
have
employees
,
I
can
tell
you
,
below
partner
level
,
who
would
be
prepared
to
mortgage
their
children
to
get
a
partnership
here
.
And
Angela
did
n't
need
to
borrow
-
I
imagine
you
've
talked
to
her
solicitors
?
Well
then
,
you
know
that
she
was
pretty
well
placed
.
"
"
I
did
n't
know
that
a
business
like
this
needed
much
working
capital
?
"
McLeish
said
,
in
faithful
imitation
of
Timothy
Hutton
.
"
Oh
,
you
'd
be
surprised
.
We
live
off
fees
,
of
course
,
but
they
can
be
slow
coming
in
.
And
this
is
a
short
lease
here
-
we
have
to
provide
for
buying
something
or
paying
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
rent
.
No
,
that
sort
of
money
is
needed
,
believe
me
.
"
McLeish
,
who
had
a
built-in
prejudice
,
well
supported
by
experience
,
against
statements
incorporating
an
appeal
to
belief
,
noted
dourly
that
he
might
at
some
later
stage
need
to
get
closer
to
Yeo
Davis
's
accounts
.
That
could
wait
,
and
he
would
possibly
talk
to
Timothy
Hutton
again
first
.
He
wound
up
the
interview
and
was
rising
to
say
goodbye
when
Catherine
,
sounding
shy
,
asked
Peter
Yeo
if
she
could
possibly
use
their
ladies
'
room
.
"
Of
course
,
of
course
.
"
Peter
Yeo
was
obviously
delighted
to
do
any
service
,
however
modest
,
for
her
and
bustled
her
away
,
returning
belatedly
to
ask
McLeish
if
he
would
like
a
similar
facility
,
which
he
accepted
,
obedient
to
the
unwritten
CID
rule
that
you
looked
after
your
physical
needs
at
any
moment
that
opportunity
offered
,
because
you
never
knew
when
you
were
going
to
get
stuck
for
hours
without
help
.
He
waited
what
seemed
to
him
rather
an
excessive
ti
me
for
Catherine
,
but
decided
,
charitably
,
that
you
could
n't
look
as
she
did
without
pretty
regular
attention
to
the
overall
effect
.
They
were
in
the
car
,
preparing
to
drive
off
,
before
she
spoke
.
"
There
's
a
nice
little
flatlet
on
the
second
floor
.
Bathroom
,
bedroom
with
double
bed
,
kitchen
off
.
I
thought
there
might
be
.
"
He
looked
at
her
sideways
;
she
sounded
both
smug
and
irritated
.
"
You
think
it
's
misused
regularly
?
"
"
I
'd
put
money
on
it
.
"
The
response
was
so
swift
and
unhesitating
that
McLeish
was
taken
aback
,
and
drove
much
too
close
to
the
car
in
front
.
"
Sorry
.
You
thought
he
was
that
kind
of
bloke
?
"
She
was
silent
,
and
pink
across
the
cheekbones
-
and
McLeish
,
who
like
all
good
policemen
depended
heavily
on
intuition
,
understood
suddenly
that
experience
was
speaking
here
.
She
laughed
shortly
,
obviously
annoyed
with
herself
but
determined
to
make
her
point
.
"
Well
,
let's
say
that
I
've
heard
of
married
blokes
who
always
had
to
go
to
the
office
on
Saturdays
,
and
it
usually
was
n't
office
work
they
were
doing
.
It
sounds
all
right
,
and
if
the
wife
gets
suspicious
and
rings
up
,
well
he
's
there
,
is
n't
he
?
"
"
Not
so
good
if
the
wife
decides
to
drop
in
,
"
McLeish
offered
,
with
interest
.
"
Well
,
you
have
to
keep
the
office
door
locked
on
a
Saturday
,
do
n't
you
?
So
you
've
got
warning
,
"
she
said
dismissively
,
and
McLeish
let
himself
,
briefly
,
wonder
who
the
bloke
had
been
who
had
introduced
Catherine
to
this
experience
.
He
abandoned
speculation
firmly
and
concentrated
on
the
implications
for
the
present
case
,
since
he
was
plainly
being
offered
expert
testimony
.
"
Could
be
that
any
of
the
other
partners
used
it
?
"
he
suggested
.
"
The
place
is
n't
run
like
that
.
Mr
Yeo
is
the
boss
,
is
n't
he
?
"
So
she
too
had
observed
Yeo
's
imperial
command
of
the
partnership
.
"
No
,
I
agree
.
So
he
was
maybe
with
a
girl
on
that
Saturday
?
"
"
Maybe
.
I
was
wondering
about
him
and
Miss
Morgan
.
I
mean
,
he
likes
women
,
and
she
operated
by
sleeping
with
the
boss
.
"
McLeish
found
himself
shocked
by
this
piece
of
feminine
sharpness
and
must
have
registered
something
because
his
sergeant
blushed
.
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
like
it
sounds
-
she
did
n't
do
it
to
get
on
,
or
not
like
that
.
"
Her
hands
moved
,
in
frustration
as
she
tried
to
explain
.
"
I
think
she
might
have
done
it
as
a
quick
way
of
finding
out
how
the
business
worked
.
Because
she
was
obviously
both
clever
and
ambitious
.
"
"
Mm
.
"
McLeish
found
himself
receiving
this
with
reluctance
and
wondered
why
,
since
it
made
sense
.
He
glanced
at
her
,
being
taken
aback
to
find
her
looking
strained
and
as
near
plain
as
anyone
with
her
looks
was
going
to
.
Her
profile
was
very
sharp
against
the
gathering
darkness
.
"
What
is
it
,
love
?
"
he
asked
,
anxiously
,
falling
into
a
term
of
his
childhood
,
and
she
jumped
.
"
Sorry
,
I
'd
drifted
off
.
I
was
wondering
about
Peter
Yeo
.
Suppose
they
had
been
having
an
affair
,
and
she
'd
dropped
him
?
"
McLeish
considered
this
.
"
When
she
met
Giles
Hawick
?
"
"
Well
,
that
's
possible
,
is
n't
it
?
If
you
remember
,
Hawick
said
-
and
he
's
not
silly
-
that
there
was
someone
else
on
the
scene
when
he
first
asked
her
out
.
Perhaps
it
was
Mr
Yeo
?
And
she
decided
Hawick
was
the
better
bet
,
particularly
since
he
was
n't
married
.
"
McLeish
pondered
this
,
eyes
narrowed
,
driving
fast
but
carefully
.
"
Perhaps
there
is
n't
all
that
much
fun
in
going
around
with
a
married
bloke
,
after
all
?
"
"
She
could
still
have
wanted
him
but
got
tired
of
waiting
-
decided
he
was
n't
going
to
leave
his
wife
.
"
Catherine
was
sounding
tough
and
rational
,
but
something
in
her
voice
made
him
feel
this
whole
discussion
was
uncomfortable
for
her
.
He
sneaked
a
look
at
her
,
and
found
he
had
an
excellent
view
of
the
back
of
her
head
;
she
was
staring
out
of
the
passenger
window
at
the
darkening
vista
of
St
James
's
Park
.
He
looked
again
,
cautiously
,
and
saw
that
she
was
blindly
extracting
a
crumpled
paper
handkerchief
from
her
neat
navy
bag
.
He
waited
thirty
seconds
before
glancing
sideways
again
,
and
found
her
dabbing
at
her
face
,
trying
hard
not
to
sniff
.
He
flicked
up
the
left-hand
indicator
and
stopped
the
car
.
"
I
need
some
tea
and
I
've
got
a
thermos
here
,
"
he
announced
,
getting
out
of
the
car
without
looking
at
her
and
opening
the
back
door
on
his
side
to
find
the
thermos
which
he
had
filled
before
starting
off
.
He
got
the
top
off
and
a
cup
poured
before
lowering
himself
gingerly
back
into
the
driving
seat
and
passing
it
over
to
Catherine
.
Then
he
glanced
quickly
at
her
.
It
was
nearly
dark
outside
but
the
dashboard
lights
cast
a
faint
greenish
glow
.
She
was
still
sitting
with
her
head
partly
averted
,
so
her
face
was
hidden
.
He
poured
himself
a
cup
of
tea
and
drank
it
,
selfconsciously
,
very
aware
of
her
sitting
tensely
beside
him
.
"
Thank
you
,
John
.
That
was
nice
.
"
Catherine
sounded
suddenly
exhausted
,
and
as
she
gave
him
back
the
cup
she
turned
towards
him
,
letting
him
see
that
she
had
been
crying
,
but
without
looking
him
in
the
face
.
Looking
down
at
the
curve
of
her
cheekbone
,
still
wet
with
tears
,
he
suddenly
wanted
her
,
quite
overwhelmingly
.
He
sat
frozen
in
his
seat
by
surprise
,
so
blocked
by
his
own
consideration
of
duty
,
honour
and
the
right
way
to
behave
to
junior
staff
that
in
the
end
it
was
she
who
moved
towards
him
,
and
touched
his
cheek
.
He
slid
his
cheek
against
hers
and
,
moving
with
delicious
deliberate
slowness
,
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
.
The
sheer
pleasure
of
it
swept
him
up
and
it
was
a
full
minute
before
he
pulled
back
and
looked
at
her
,
amazed
at
how
happy
he
felt
.
"
Jesus
,
Catherine
.
Another
minute
and
I
'll
be
inviting
you
into
the
back
of
the
car
.
"
He
watched
her
smile
,
happy
and
comfortable
with
him
,
secure
in
the
pleasure
they
shared
.
"
If
you
like
,
or
we
could
go
back
to
my
flat
?
"
For
McLeish
the
rest
of
the
journey
had
the
quality
of
a
dream
.
With
one
part
of
his
mind
he
knew
he
was
getting
the
benefit
of
the
backlash
from
an
experience
in
Catherine
's
past
,
but
with
another
part
he
did
n't
care
about
any
of
that
,
there
was
no
reality
beyond
her
.
The
feeling
of
dream-like
ease
persisted
when
they
arrived
at
Catherine
's
flat
.
He
opened
the
car
door
for
her
,
hugged
her
as
she
got
out
,
and
they
went
up
to
her
flat
,
his
arm
round
her
shoulders
.
He
took
off
her
clothes
for
her
,
while
she
undid
as
many
of
his
buttons
as
she
could
,
and
after
that
it
was
pure
,
undiluted
,
uncomplicated
pleasure
until
they
fell
asleep
in
each
other
's
arms
.
Either
Bruce
Davidson
always
sounded
like
a
Speak
Your
Weight
machine
when
he
was
delivering
a
prepared
statement
,
or
the
answer-phone
stripped
all
character
from
People
's
voices
.
McLeish
had
rung
his
own
flat
to
collect
messages
;
he
could
see
Catherine
just
waking
,
and
waved
to
her
to
indicate
that
he
was
on
the
phone
.
He
realized
that
he
was
getting
cold
,
clad
as
he
was
exclusively
in
a
rather
small
towel
,
but
decided
to
stick
it
out
and
pick
up
all
of
Davidson
's
message
.
There
were
two
key
pieces
.
The
first
was
the
news
from
Cambridge
:
the
samples
of
blood
and
hair
collected
by
his
long-suffering
team
were
confirmed
as
a
match
to
the
dead
girl
's
.
The
indentation
in
her
skull
also
matched
.
She
had
either
fallen
or
been
pushed
on
to
a
spike
on
the
plough
;
the
level
of
her
blood
alcohol
gave
some
credence
to
the
idea
that
she
had
fallen
.
The
doctor
who
had
done
the
autopsy
,
however
,
had
scouted
,
promptly
,
any
suggestion
that
she
could
have
moved
thereafter
.
She
had
died
instantaneously
,
or
pretty
nearly
so
,
without
first
getting
up
and
crawling
down
the
embankment
,
or
for
that
matter
getting
up
and
riding
a
bicycle
.
Someone
had
thus
moved
the
body
,
and
it
had
to
be
assumed
that
it
was
the
same
person
who
had
pushed
her
on
to
the
plough
.
"
Doc
says
the
best
bet
,
given
the
mark
on
her
cheek
is
that
someone
slapped
her
one
and
she
fell
back
.
He
'll
put
it
in
writing
tomorrow
,
"
Davidson
summarized
succinctly
.
The
second
key
piece
of
information
was
that
Angela
Morgan
's
car
had
been
found
in
North
Kensington
,
not
far
from
her
flat
,
and
was
now
cordoned
off
and
being
crawled
over
inch
by
inch
by
a
forensic
team
hastily
dispatched
by
Davidson
.
Did
McLeish
want
to
come
and
see
it
,
in
situ
,
because
they
would
have
to
move
it
when
Forensic
had
finished
?
A
detailed
inventory
of
Bruce
's
day
followed
,
and
McLeish
understood
that
having
Catherine
Crane
working
on
this
case
had
rattled
Bruce
in
several
ways
.
Right
at
the
end
,
as
McLeish
's
teeth
were
starting
to
chatter
,
Davidson
confirmed
that
Penelope
Huntley
would
meet
him
at
eight
next
morning
and
he
hoped
that
that
was
n't
too
early
,
sorry
,
but
the
lass
had
been
difficult
to
tie
down
to
a
time
.
McLeish
glanced
again
at
his
watch
-
eleven-thirty
p.m
.
Just
as
well
someone
had
rung
Catherine
half
an
hour
ago
,
or
they
'd
both
still
have
been
asleep
,
and
he
would
have
had
difficult
questions
to
answer
in
the
morning
about
why
he
had
been
,
uncharacteristically
,
out
of
touch
with
everyone
since
leaving
Yeo
Davis
at
six
.
He
rang
Davidson
to
confirm
that
he
could
make
the
eight
a.
m.
appointment
.
"
We
have
a
date
at
eight
o'clock
,
"
he
said
redundantly
to
Catherine
.
"
I
heard
.
I
've
put
the
heating
on
.
Why
do
n't
you
have
a
bath
,
you
're
cold
?
"
"
I
"
d
like
that
.
They
've
found
her
car
,
too
-
I
'll
have
to
go
and
look
at
it
before
they
take
it
away
.
"
"
I
'll
come
with
you
.
"
He
hesitated
.
"
Nothing
I
'd
like
better
.
But
they
're
all
going
to
wonder
why
I
dragged
you
along
at
this
time
of
night
.
I
mean
,
what
have
we
been
doing
?
"
Catherine
looked
downcast
,
and
McLeish
felt
uneasy
.
"
Sweet
,
it
's
you
I
'm
trying
to
protect
.
"
"
And
yourself
.
"
McLeish
acknowledged
the
point
promptly
.
"
Both
of
us
need
protecting
.
Old
Stevenson
would
go
spare
if
he
knew
,
and
I
'm
not
certain
whether
he
'd
try
and
get
me
moved
as
a
danger
to
junior
staff
,
or
you
moved
as
a
wicked
woman
.
But
he
'd
shift
one
of
us
.
His
staff
do
not
have
private
lives
and
certainly
not
with
each
other
.
"
She
looked
at
him
carefully
;
wrapped
in
a
sheet
,
with
her
blond
curly
hair
ruffled
,
she
looked
like
an
advertisement
for
almost
anything
.
"
Sorry
,
you
're
right
,
"
she
said
.
"
It
would
be
me
he
'd
try
and
shift
,
too
.
He
's
not
got
much
of
a
reputation
as
a
feminist
.
"
"
The
Met
's
a
bit
short
of
those
,
"
McLeish
agreed
.
"
Look
,
you
get
some
sleep
.
I
'll
go
and
see
the
car
and
get
back
to
my
flat
,
and
I
'll
pick
you
up
at
seven-thirty
tomorrow
.
All
right
?
"
"
You
'd
like
to
get
home
?
"
She
was
perfectly
secure
in
her
own
attractions
and
amused
,
and
McLeish
was
disconcerted
.
"
No
,
I
mean
-
no
.
I
just
thought
you
would
n't
want
to
be
woken
up
again
.
"
"
I
do
n't
mind
being
woken
up
.
"
He
found
himself
avoiding
the
street
in
which
Francesca
lived
as
he
drove
for
North
Kensington
,
calling
ahead
on
his
car
phone
to
make
sure
that
the
forensic
team
was
still
there
.
He
arrived
to
find
them
just
finishing
and
asked
hopefully
if
any
prints
had
been
found
.
"
No
prints
on
the
steering-wheel
or
any
of
the
doors
.
Somebody
's
been
over
it
with
a
duster
.
They
probably
wore
gloves
,
too
.
We
've
got
some
smudges
but
that
's
not
a
lot
of
use
.
"
McLeish
left
them
to
it
and
walked
away
to
consider
exactly
where
he
was
.
It
was
a
cul-de-sac
off
Ladbroke
Grove
,
with
two
restaurants
and
two
large
pubs
at
the
top
of
it
.
The
pub
was
orthodoxly
darkened
and
shuttered
,
but
a
few
diners
were
still
left
in
the
restaurants
.
It
was
a
road
on
the
way
up
,
this
Malplaquet
Terrace
,
as
McLeish
,
a
Londoner
by
adoption
,
observed
.
The
two
large
pubs
,
the
little
Indian
grocer
,
and
the
shabby
peeling
premises
which
offered
dry-cleaning
were
relics
of
an
earlier
era
,
but
both
restaurants
,
on
the
other
hand
,
were
new
and
forbiddingly
smart
.
One
was
Italian
,
one
French
;
both
were
separated
from
the
street
by
extensive
terraces
and
were
distinctly
expensive
.
He
peered
at
the
menu
displayed
with
accompanying
admiring
press
comment
outside
the
Trattoria
San
Giorgio
,
and
decided
you
'd
be
lucky
to
get
out
of
there
under
£20
a
head
.
La
Bretagne
looked
even
pricier
.
Next
to
these
was
a
small
antique
shop
,
window
lights
on
even
at
this
hour
,
displaying
elegant
white
china
dogs
and
small
pieces
of
Victorian
furniture
,
and
next
to
that
an
estate
agent
.
It
would
only
be
a
matter
of
ti
me
before
the
pubs
,
the
little
grocer
and
the
dry-cleaner
's
were
replaced
by
some
establishment
selling
something
on
which
an
enormous
mark-up
could
be
obtained
.
As
he
walked
back
down
the
cul-de-sac
McLeish
found
a
demarcation
line
,
so
precise
it
might
have
been
achieved
by
running
a
tape
across
the
road
,
where
the
commercial
element
stopped
and
flat-fronted
,
early
Victorian
terraced
houses
,
took
over
.
Further
down
yet
,
the
terracing
ceased
and
became
pairs
of
large
semi-detached
houses
set
well
back
from
the
road
with
the
front
gardens
mostly
paved
and
dedicated
to
parking
space
.
It
was
possible
to
see
the
same
sort
of
divide
as
at
the
commercial
end
:
every
second
house
had
been
restored
and
repainted
,
with
extensions
sprouting
in
the
gaps
between
them
.
Most
of
the
others
seemed
to
be
in
the
process
of
renovation
.
McLeish
counted
,
out
of
interest
,
ten
separate
sets
of
scaffolding
.
People
would
still
be
living
here
who
had
been
in
residence
since
before
the
war
and
were
holding
on
to
controlled
tenancies
until
dislodged
by
offers
of
cash
or
other
accommodation
,
but
they
would
not
be
there
much
longer
.
He
had
arrived
back
beside
Angela
Morgan
's
car
,
and
stopped
to
contemplate
it
.
A
blue
BMW
,
neat
but
not
gaudy
,
not
souped-up
,
but
a
fast
,
useful
car
.
On
her
money
she
could
well
have
afforded
something
grander
,
like
a
Porsche
,
but
evidently
she
had
decided
against
ostentation
.
It
was
the
sort
of
car
that
a
successful
young
man
bought
for
himself
,
not
a
woman
's
car
in
the
generally
used
sense
of
the
phrase
,
nor
a
car
that
a
man
would
choose
for
a
woman
.
It
was
neither
the
sensible
shopping-basket
that
men
bought
for
their
wives
,
nor
the
flashy
jobs
rich
men
bought
for
their
mistresses
.
He
looked
at
the
number
plate
and
realized
that
he
had
found
the
sole
piece
of
ostentation
Miss
Morgan
had
allowed
herself
;
she
had
been
Angela
Jane
Morgan
and
the
car
was
AJM
563
.
She
must
have
had
to
pay
a
bit
for
that
.
The
car
was
parked
neatly
between
two
patches
of
off-street
parking
,
in
one
of
the
very
few
parts
of
the
street
that
was
neither
metered
nor
dedicated
to
residents
'
parking
.
Not
put
here
by
chance
then
;
someone
had
known
this
street
.
Assuming
the
car
had
gone
missing
at
the
same
ti
me
as
Angela
Morgan
,
it
might
have
been
there
for
over
a
week
;
it
had
only
been
found
that
evening
by
a
uniformed
constable
who
was
keeping
his
eyes
open
.
Evidently
,
people
in
this
street
were
used
to
strange
cars
being
parked
and
nobody
had
thought
it
worth
while
to
ring
the
police
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
doors
bristled
with
Neighbourhood
Watch
signs
.
Perhaps
the
car
had
not
actually
been
there
since
Angela
Morgan
disappeared
,
but
that
seemed
unlikely
.
He
asked
the
forensic
team
leader
for
his
views
and
the
man
shook
his
head
.
"
I
would
think
it
's
been
here
for
several
days
,
sir
.
It
's
covered
with
dust
and
the
road
's
dry
underneath
,
although
we
've
had
a
lot
of
rain
.
"
"
Anything
useful
?
"
"
We
've
got
some
tiny
samples
from
the
tyres
.
It
's
been
in
the
mud
somewhere
.
We
'll
compare
it
with
what
we
took
up
at
the
site
.
"
"
Could
be
the
murderer
used
this
car
?
"
"
He
cleaned
it
first
,
then
,
before
dumping
it
,
sir
.
Nothing
on
it
,
just
a
few
smudges
.
Probably
put
it
through
a
car-wash
.
The
inside
has
been
vacuumed
recently
,
too
.
We
're
not
getting
much
here
,
apart
from
the
samples
off
the
tyres
,
We
'll
take
it
apart
when
we
get
it
away
from
here
,
of
course
.
"
Both
men
stood
aside
to
let
a
big
dark-green
Jaguar
edge
carefully
round
them
on
to
the
forecourt
of
the
house
immediately
to
the
left
of
where
the
BMW
was
parked
.
A
small
bouncy
couple
in
their
fifties
got
out
,
staring
at
the
lights
and
the
screens
round
Angela
Morgan
's
car
,
and
came
over
to
them
with
all
the
confidence
of
the
middle-class
member
of
a
Neighbourhood
Watch
scheme
.
"
Can
I
help
?
That
car
's
been
parked
there
over
a
week
,
and
I
was
just
beginning
to
wonder
about
ringing
the
police
.
Lots
of
people
from
the
restaurants
park
down
here
in
the
evening
,
but
I
only
just
realized
,
talking
to
my
wife
,
that
it
had
actually
been
there
all
day
as
well
.
Stolen
car
,
is
it
?
"
McLeish
,
tired
as
he
was
,
fell
promptly
on
this
witness
and
accepted
an
invitation
to
coffee
.
The
Masters
had
been
out
to
dinner
and
were
well
mellowed
,
wide
awake
and
disposed
to
chat
,
but
sitting
in
their
quarry-tiled
kitchen-diner
,
with
thousands
of
pounds
'
worth
of
elegant
cabinet
work
and
expensive
machinery
around
him
,
McLeish
managed
to
extract
a
coherent
story
.
Mr
Masters
was
quite
clear
that
he
had
first
seen
the
blue
BMW
late
on
the
Saturday
evening
,
ten
days
before
,
pointing
out
that
,
while
you
could
n't
exactly
complain
,
it
had
made
access
to
his
own
forecourt
space
a
little
difficult
,
or
at
least
when
there
was
already
another
car
on
the
forecourt
,
which
there
mostly
was
,
that
being
Mrs
Masters
's
runabout
.
He
was
sure
it
had
been
there
every
night
since
,
and
Mrs
Masters
turned
out
to
be
equally
confident
that
it
had
also
been
there
during
the
day
.
They
had
looked
at
each
other
,
disconcerted
at
this
apparent
lack
of
liaison
,
but
McLeish
had
been
reassuring
:
very
natural
that
they
had
n't
compared
notes
,
extremely
useful
that
he
now
knew
how
long
the
car
had
been
there
.
"
Was
it
stolen
,
Chief
Inspector
?
I
mean
,
do
chief
inspectors
look
at
stolen
cars
?
We
've
never
seen
much
above
a
detective
sergeant
in
the
road
before
?
"
Mr
Masters
,
mellow
or
not
,
had
gathered
his
wits
.
He
was
a
small
bright-eyed
,
balding
,
active
man
,
interested
in
everything
around
him
.
"
Not
necessarily
.
We
've
been
looking
for
this
car
as
part
of
a
murder
investigation
.
It
belonged
to
a
Miss
Angela
Morgan
,
and
you
may
have
seen
the
death
reported
.
"
"
What
's
the
matter
with
me
?
"
Mr
Masters
enquired
,
smiting
himself
on
the
forehead
.
"
I
saw
it
in
the
papers
,
I
even
noticed
that
the
car
was
missing
,
and
it
was
a
BMW
.
I
just
did
n't
put
it
together
.
"
"
You
would
have
,
sooner
or
later
,
"
McLeish
said
,
liking
the
man
.
"
That
's
what
happens
,
something
ticks
away
in
your
mind
and
you
suddenly
realize
there
's
a
connection
.
We
'll
have
to
send
people
round
all
the
houses
in
the
street
,
see
if
anyone
saw
the
person
who
left
the
car
here
.
"
"
Could
have
been
the
girl
herself
?
"
"
Yes
,
possibly
.
"
McLeish
decided
not
to
expand
,
and
rose
to
go
,
conscious
that
it
was
one-thirty
a.m
.
And
that
he
had
an
interview
at
eight
in
the
morning
.
He
found
at
the
edge
of
his
consciousness
the
wish
that
he
was
just
going
to
his
own
flat
to
crash
out
rather
than
back
to
share
Catherine
's
warm
bed
.
At
eight
a.m.
it
was
pouring
with
rain
,
and
very
cold
,
as
the
partners
of
Yeo
Davis
straggled
in
through
the
neat
entrance
,
their
footsteps
echoing
on
the
tiles
.
It
was
far
too
early
for
the
immaculate
and
highly
paid
receptionist
to
be
in
;
in
fact
,
no
one
below
the
level
of
partner
was
present
.
Peter
Yeo
,
accustomed
to
leading
from
the
front
,
had
arrived
at
seven-thirty
and
personally
made
the
coffee
and
brought
in
croissants
,
so
that
the
reassuring
presence
of
food
greeted
the
other
three
partners
.
"
Sorry
to
get
you
here
so
early
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
Angela
's
death
means
we
have
to
reorganize
the
entire
workload
,
and
I
wanted
a
longer
meeting
today
.
There
's
a
lot
going
on
.
Tim
,
I
'd
like
you
to
report
on
administrative
matters
first
,
to
get
that
out
of
the
way
.
"
Tim
Reagan
,
a
gaunt
forty-year-old
,
who
was
a
genius
with
trade
unions
as
well
as
being
an
accountant
and
Peter
Yeo
's
right
hand
,
moved
swiftly
through
the
secretarial
problem
,
which
was
one
of
shortage
of
same
,
and
seemed
,
as
Peter
Yeo
observed
pleasantly
,
to
have
been
exactly
the
same
difficulty
any
time
in
the
last
two
years
,
to
a
discussion
of
building
security
,
in
which
no
one
was
much
interested
either
.
"
The
next
problem
is
fees
,
"
Tim
said
,
noticing
sardonically
that
his
partners
'
level
of
attention
rose
sharply
.
"
As
you
all
know
,
we
billed
£400,000
for
our
success
fee
to
Regina
Securities
a
good
eleven
months
ago
-
they
were
one
of
Richard
's
clients
.
"
He
paused
and
the
meeting
observed
a
thirty-second
silence
in
honour
of
Richard
Fairley
who
had
left
the
partnership
a
year
previously
for
considerably
more
than
a
handful
of
silver
,
taking
with
him
Regina
Securities
'
main
reason
for
being
interested
in
paying
Yeo
Davis
's
bills
.
"
I
've
written
,
Peter
's
written
,
the
solicitors
have
written
.
Absolutely
nothing
has
happened
.
We
need
to
decide
whether
to
put
in
a
writ
or
what
.
"
"
Have
we
tried
lunch
?
"
the
next
most
senior
partner
enquired
hopefully
,
invoking
what
all
felt
to
be
the
partnership
's
most
powerful
weapon
.
"
Oh
God
,
yes
.
"
Peter
Yeo
roused
himself
.
"
Brady
and
I
lunched
,
and
we
've
talked
several
times
.
He
's
been
all
sweetness
and
light
,
promised
nothing
and
done
ditto
.
"
"
Do
we
have
to
sue
?
"
the
questioner
pressed
,
unhappily
,
and
Tim
Reagan
considered
him
wearily
.
"
Mike
,
that
£400,000
sits
in
our
last
year
's
accounts
as
an
asset
-
a
debt
someone
owes
us
.
It
's
in
this
year
's
draft
accounts
too
,
but
we
have
people
called
auditors
who
are
going
to
recognize
this
bill
,
and
ask
all
sorts
of
boring
questions
like
why
it
has
not
been
paid
,
whether
it
is
likely
to
be
paid
,
and
if
so
when
.
And
if
we
ca
n't
produce
some
pretty
credible
answers
then
they
wo
n't
allow
that
£400,000
to
sit
in
the
accounts
at
the
full
value
.
Either
we
'll
have
to
take
a
very
heavy
discount
on
it
,
or
we
'll
get
our
accounts
qualified
.
The
other
even
more
pressing
reason
is
that
we
need
the
cash
;
we
're
running
an
overdraft
and
that
's
not
funny
with
these
interest
rates
.
"
Peter
Yeo
,
who
had
been
watching
his
partners
,
realized
that
he
and
Tim
were
not
carrying
the
other
two
and
decided
to
make
another
effort
.
"
The
reason
the
auditors
will
give
us
trouble
,
Mike
,
is
that
they
have
to
certify
that
our
accounts
give
a
true
and
fair
account
of
the
financial
state
of
the
business
.
And
if
we
have
£400,000
in
there
which
is
n't
really
£400,000
,
then
the
accounts
do
n't
tell
you
what
's
going
on
.
"
He
watched
grimly
as
Mike
Laister
,
easily
the
best
man
with
any
drinks
company
,
grasped
the
point
.
"
The
business
is
n't
worth
what
we
thought
it
was
,
that
's
what
you
're
saying
?
"
"
Right
.
"
Tim
Reagan
was
obviously
relieved
.
"
Or
it
may
not
be
,
but
we
wo
n't
know
till
we
sue
them
.
"
"
It
'll
take
a
long
time
in
the
courts
,
wo
n't
it
,
though
?
"
Mike
Laister
was
still
clinging
to
his
point
of
view
.
"
What
we
hope
is
that
a
writ
will
make
them
settle
,
Mike
,
at
some
level
.
"
Peter
Yeo
sounded
soothing
.
"
It
'd
better
,
"
Tim
Reagan
said
.
"
The
administrators
of
Angela
's
estate
are
going
to
ask
for
her
£100,000
back
.
They
're
not
going
to
get
it
till
the
end
of
the
notice
period
,
which
is
twelve
months
,
but
we
need
the
cash
.
And
we
are
behind
with
tax
.
"
"
We
've
got
more
than
enough
time
to
worry
about
that
,
Tim
,
and
I
'm
sure
the
bank
will
cover
us
.
"
Peter
Yeo
spoke
hastily
.
"
But
do
we
now
all
agree
that
we
should
issue
a
writ
against
Regina
?
I
honestly
do
n't
believe
there
is
any
alternative
.
"
His
partners
,
brought
to
the
sticking
point
,
agreed
,
somewhat
reproachfully
,
and
passed
on
firmly
to
the
question
of
who
was
going
to
take
over
which
of
Angela
's
clients
.
"
I
will
of
course
remain
responsible
for
Barton
,
since
I
know
Andy
well
,
"
Peter
Yeo
said
,
firmly
.
"
But
I
'll
need
some
support
if
I
am
to
give
him
the
service
he
wants
.
Angela
was
doing
a
very
good
job
there
,
taking
him
round
the
MPs
he
had
to
talk
to
.
"
Tim
Reagan
stirred
.
"
I
did
say
to
her
that
the
man
Andy
should
see
was
Giles
Hawick
himself
.
It
will
in
the
end
be
a
Treasury
concern
,
and
if
the
DTI
is
really
going
to
be
allowed
to
spend
millions
propping
up
Huerter
,
now
that
it
's
a
different
government
,
it
's
very
much
in
Hawick
's
area
.
Maybe
she
felt
it
was
too
awkward
?
Or
maybe
she
felt
she
could
do
the
briefing
personally
,
as
it
were
?
Did
she
do
anything
about
that
?
"
He
observed
with
interest
that
his
partner
Peter
Yeo
was
looking
extremely
uncomfortable
.
"
She
would
have
,
of
course
,
but
I
do
n't
know
if
she
did
.
"
He
considered
,
scratching
the
side
of
his
jaw
.
"
It
's
a
good
point
,
though
,
Tim
,
thank
you
.
I
'll
see
what
I
can
do
with
it
.
There
's
a
lot
of
work
to
do
on
that
case
-
can
I
have
Susy
Harvey
to
assist
?
"
Two
of
his
partners
protested
promptly
that
the
said
Susy
was
fully
deployed
on
their
cases
,
and
Peter
Yeo
settled
down
to
reorganize
the
workload
,
emerging
after
ten
minutes
'
hard
negotiation
with
more
or
less
the
conclusion
he
had
wanted
.
"
I
ca
n't
do
that
thing
on
Saturday
"
"
he
said
apologetically
to
Tim
Reagan
,
who
,
having
sacrificed
one
of
his
staff
in
the
arrangement
,
was
mildly
suggesting
a
reciprocal
deal
.
"
I
've
promised
to
take
Claudia
away
for
the
weekend
,
and
she
's
not
going
to
let
me
off
it
even
though
we
're
so
shorthanded
.
Ca
n't
blame
her
,
really
;
there
's
never
any
time
.
"
Tim
Reagan
,
who
would
not
have
dared
to
give
his
French
wife
as
little
time
as
Claudia
Yeo
got
,
murmured
that
this
was
of
course
important
and
good
luck
to
them
,
indeed
.
"
Something
else
I
wanted
to
mention
,
Peter
,
"
he
went
on
.
"
If
it
turns
out
that
£400,000
really
is
n't
there
,
then
perhaps
we
charged
Angela
too
much
for
her
partnership
share
?
We
were
acting
in
good
faith
,
of
course
,
and
I
ca
n't
imagine
that
anyone
is
going
to
be
difficult
now
she
is
gone
.
Just
thought
I
'd
mention
it
-
the
auditors
may
say
something
like
it
.
"
"
Let
them
,
"
Peter
Yeo
said
,
angrily
.
"
Angie
had
nothing
to
complain
about
-
anyone
would
have
been
glad
to
put
up
£100,000
to
get
in
here
.
That
Regina
fee
is
just
a
blip
-
we
're
on
to
a
£500,000
success
fee
from
Barton
,
and
we
'll
get
that
.
"
Tim
Reagan
raised
his
hands
in
mock
submission
,
surprised
by
his
partner
's
vehemence
,
and
followed
him
out
of
the
door
.
In
the
hall
sat
Claudia
Yeo
herself
,
evidently
waiting
for
her
husband
,
and
Tim
stopped
to
say
hello
to
her
.
She
looked
as
if
she
needed
that
weekend
away
.
She
was
overweight
,
overtired
,
distinctly
anxious
,
her
hair
was
untidy
,
and
both
her
suit
and
her
shoes
were
in
need
of
a
clean
.
Not
what
one
expected
of
the
wife
of
the
senior
partner
,
Tim
observed
,
thinking
smugly
of
his
own
immaculately
turned-out
Patrice
,
who
would
refuse
to
eat
if
she
put
on
even
an
extra
pound
and
who
would
as
soon
leave
the
house
naked
as
without
make-up
.
"
Oh
,
Peter
,
there
you
are
.
"
His
senior
partner
was
not
at
all
ravished
by
this
incursion
into
his
working
day
,
Tim
observed
maliciously
,
as
he
faded
tactfully
away
.
Peter
Yeo
bustled
his
wife
into
his
office
calling
automatically
for
coffee
.
"
Claudia
,
I
've
got
a
meeting
in
ten
minutes
,
then
I
'm
booked
solid
through
the
day
.
What
is
it
?
Can
it
not
wait
till
tonight
?
"
"
What
do
you
mean
,
tonight
?
Eleven-thirty
or
later
,
as
usual
?
Perhaps
I
ought
to
ring
Dawn
and
make
an
appointment
if
I
want
to
talk
to
you
?
You
never
see
the
children
either
.
"
They
glared
at
each
other
across
the
table
,
two
people
in
early
middle
age
who
had
had
the
same
quarrel
in
the
same
words
many
times
.
By
mutual
consent
they
desisted
,
and
Peter
Yeo
took
a
deep
breath
.
"
Sorry
,
"
he
said
,
grimly
.
"
What
is
the
problem
?
"
"
I
've
had
the
police
round
,
asking
about
Angela
.
"
Peter
Yeo
breathed
deep
in
exasperation
.
"
Type
of
police
?
Bobby
in
a
helmet
with
a
notebook
,
was
it
?
"
Claudia
considered
him
with
open
dislike
and
lit
a
cigarette
deliberately
.
"
No
,
dear
,
a
CID
sergeant
from
Scotland
Yard
.
A
Scot
.
I
asked
to
see
his
identification
.
And
his
assistant
's
.
"
"
I
'll
find
you
an
ashtray
.
Do
n't
put
it
in
the
saucer
,
Claudia
,
for
God
's
sake
.
"
Peter
Yeo
felt
a
headache
starting
,
and
felt
the
familiar
pressure
just
above
the
right
eye
worsen
with
the
realization
that
in
precisely
five
minutes
he
would
be
needed
in
a
meeting
.
"
What
did
he
want
to
know
?
"
She
did
n't
answer
immediately
but
looked
down
at
the
table
,
then
up
at
him
.
"
When
I
come
to
think
about
it
afterwards
,
I
do
n't
know
quite
what
he
was
after
.
"
Peter
Yeo
controlled
the
impulse
to
shout
at
her
,
realizing
that
his
wife
was
badly
rattled
.
She
might
exasperate
him
,
but
she
was
fully
as
intelligent
as
he
was
and
it
would
be
as
well
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
.
"
Did
he
say
why
he
had
come
to
see
you
?
"
"
He
had
a
perfectly
good
reason
.
They
had
checked
Angela
's
diary
for
the
two
weeks
before
she
had
gone
missing
and
were
talking
to
everyone
in
it
.
"
"
Including
the
clients
?
"
peter
Yeo
sat
bolt
upright
,
appalled
.
"
Oh
God
.
Well
,
I
suppose
so
.
"
They
stared
at
each
other
,
momentarily
united
in
recognition
of
the
difficulties
.
"
I
'll
call
them
all
,
personally
.
"
Yeo
jabbed
a
finger
on
a
button
on
his
phone
.
"
Dawn
,
please
get
Angela
's
diary
for
the
two
weeks
before
she
went
missing
-
and
last
week
-
and
list
every
date
she
had
.
Now
,
please
,
in
the
next
ten
minutes
.
Sorry
,
but
this
is
a
crisis
.
"
He
returned
his
attention
to
his
wife
.
"
I
did
n't
realize
you
had
seen
Angie
quite
recently
.
"
"
We
had
a
drink
together
.
"
Peter
Yeo
rose
abruptly
and
went
to
straighten
a
picture
on
the
wall
opposite
him
,
his
wife
watching
him
warily
.
"
Why
?
"
he
asked
over
his
shoulder
.
"
I
did
n't
think
you
were
all
that
friendly
.
"
Claudia
Yeo
closed
her
eyes
and
forced
herself
to
speak
to
the
empty
space
behind
the
desk
.
"
I
suppose
I
wanted
to
make
sure
she
was
going
to
marry
Giles
Hawick
.
"
She
dragged
on
her
cigarette
,
listening
for
any
movement
from
her
husband
behind
her
,
and
jumped
as
he
walked
round
to
stare
out
of
a
window
.
"
And
she
said
she
was
?
"
he
asked
,
into
the
silence
.
"
Yes
,
she
did
.
But
she
also
said
Hawick
wanted
her
to
give
up
her
partnership
here
and
she
did
n't
think
she
could
bear
to
.
"
"
She
'd
have
talked
him
round
,
surely
?
"
Peter
Yeo
was
still
looking
out
of
the
window
,
and
Claudia
glanced
at
his
familiar
back
,
too
short
and
too
broad
despite
the
most
expensive
tailoring
,
with
real
anxiety
,
"
You
do
n't
honestly
think
that
,
do
you
,
Peter
?
People
like
Giles
Hawick
do
n't
get
talked
round
.
"
He
turned
,
and
they
regarded
each
other
steadily
across
the
room
.
"
She
was
definitely
going
to
marry
him
.
And
I
suppose
we
might
have
lost
her
in
the
long
run
,
but
not
just
yet
.
"
Claudia
Yeo
nerved
herself
for
a
final
effort
.
"
And
you
'd
really
accepted
that
they
would
marry
?
"
He
hesitated
,
then
became
angry
.
"
Of
course
I
had
,
Claudia
,
what
do
you
mean
?
"
"
I
know
you
two
were
very
close
,
as
the
papers
say
.
"
Claudia
Yeo
was
feeling
sick
,
but
knew
she
was
on
secure
ground
.
"
I
hoped
that
she
had
really
decided
to
go
for
Giles
Hawick
instead
.
"
Peter
Yeo
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
,
and
found
nothing
useful
to
say
.
"
I
did
n't
tell
the
police
any
of
this
,
of
course
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
just
said
that
I
was
having
a
drink
with
her
to
ask
her
what
she
would
really
like
as
a
wedding
present
from
the
firm
,
because
men
are
no
good
at
that
sort
of
thing
.
"
She
paused
and
looked
at
him
sidelong
.
"
I
thought
that
was
rather
clever
.
"
Peter
Yeo
's
mouth
quirked
involuntarily
.
He
reached
for
Claudia
's
hand
and
held
it
,
looking
steadily
into
her
face
.
"
She
was
a
good
mate
and
a
very
able
,
ambitious
girl
.
I
'm
not
sure
Hawick
was
right
for
her
and
I
'd
have
been
sorry
to
lose
her
,
but
that
's
beside
the
point
.
She
was
going
to
marry
him
.
"
She
tightened
her
hand
on
his
,
and
they
sat
holding
hands
for
half
a
minute
before
Peter
Yeo
caught
sight
of
his
watch
.
"
Darling
,
I
must
get
on
.
We
are
in
chaos
here
until
we
get
all
Angela
's
work
redistributed
,
we
're
all
of
us
doing
five
things
at
once
.
Thank
you
for
coming
to
talk
to
me
,
and
why
do
n't
you
come
with
me
to
this
thing
this
evening
?
It
's
not
a
riot
of
pleasure
,
but
we
'd
be
there
together
.
"
She
returned
his
kiss
,
but
declined
firmly
to
join
him
at
the
Allied
Steelmakers
'
annual
dinner
(
carriages
eleven-thirty
)
,
saying
she
would
actually
rather
go
to
the
cinema
with
a
girlfriend
,
and
tripped
out
of
the
office
looking
considerably
less
harassed
than
when
she
had
arrived
.
At
New
Scotland
Yard
,
John
McLeish
was
spitting
feathers
,
as
one
of
his
staff
graphically
put
it
.
He
had
arrived
,
pale
and
markedly
short
of
sleep
,
at
seven-fifty
and
at
eight-thirty
had
rung
Penelope
Huntley
's
flat
to
find
her
barely
awake
,
bad-tempered
,
vague
and
professing
not
to
have
made
an
appointment
at
all
.
Furious
but
civil
,
he
had
offered
to
go
round
to
her
flat
to
see
her
,
an
offer
which
she
had
declined
with
the
first
sign
of
decisiveness
she
had
been
heard
to
display
.
She
had
offered
to
be
at
New
Scotland
Yard
by
nine-thirty
and
it
was
now
nine
forty-five
.
"
She
's
playing
hard
to
get
,
is
n't
she
,
John
?
"
Bruce
Davidson
suggested
.
"
She
agreed
eight
o'clock
when
I
spoke
to
her
yesterday
,
after
I
'd
offered
her
every
other
hour
of
the
day
.
She
's
a
nutter
,
maybe
;
there
's
always
one
in
a
case
.
"
"
Mm
.
"
McLeish
decided
to
get
some
work
in
.
"
Tell
me
about
Mrs
Yeo
.
Was
her
husband
playing
around
?
"
"
I
'd
say
so
.
She
's
a
good-looking
woman
,
but
she
's
jumpy
and
she
does'na
have
the
confidence
.
Let
herself
go
a
bit
-
ye
get
that
with
women
whose
men
are
giving
them
a
hard
time
,
and
who
hav'na
found
a
way
of
getting
their
retaliation
in
first
.
"
McLeish
considered
his
local
expert
on
women
narrowly
.
"
It
's
not
evidence
.
"
"
You
didna
ask
me
for
evidence
,
John
,
you
sought
my
best
judgement
,
and
you
have
it
.
I
'd
have
been
glad
to
give
a
wee
helping
hand
there
myself
,
and
I
'm
sure
one
was
needed
.
"
Some
of
it
was
instinct
with
Davidson
,
of
course
,
but
most
of
it
was
solid
experience
,
starting
,
as
Davidson
had
once
told
him
,
with
his
being
seduced
by
the
school-dinner
lady
at
the
age
of
thirteen
in
his
native
Ayrshire
.
"
Och
well
,
John
,
there
's
not
a
lot
else
to
do
up
there
in
winter
,
"
he
had
observed
,
radically
changing
McLeish
's
views
of
the
activities
available
to
schoolchildren
in
country
districts
.
McLeish
reflected
uncomfortably
that
he
would
have
to
be
very
circumspect
in
his
dealings
with
Catherine
,
with
this
beady-eyed
observer
around
the
place
.
On
this
thought
,
Catherine
put
her
head
in
,
politely
excusing
herself
to
Bruce
Davidson
,
and
said
that
Miss
Huntley
had
finally
got
here
.
"
She
can
damn
well
wait
for
a
minute
,
"
McLeish
decided
.
"
Bruce
,
why
did
the
good
Mrs
Yeo
want
to
have
a
drink
with
her
rival
?
All
girls
together
,
did
you
think
?
No
hard
feelings
,
darling
,
so
nice
you
're
getting
married
?
"
Bruce
Davidson
considered
his
notes
.
"
She
said
to
me
that
the
partners
in
the
firm
couldna
decide
what
to
give
the
lass
for
her
wedding
and
had
asked
her
,
as
wife
of
the
senior
partner
,
to
have
a
wee
word
.
It
's
possible
,
John
.
"
"
Yes
,
it
is
,
"
McLeish
conceded
.
He
sighed
.
"
We
'll
have
to
see
her
again
,
Bruce
-
if
Yeo
was
having
it
off
with
Angela
Morgan
,
both
he
and
his
missis
have
to
be
in
the
frame
.
And
you
think
that
's
likely
?
"
"
I
told
you
that
I
formed
the
impression
that
Mrs
Yeo
was
not
secure
in
her
husband
's
affections
,
"
Davidson
said
,
primly
.
McLeish
grinned
at
him
and
told
Catherine
to
organize
Penelope
Huntley
,
hoping
he
had
struck
the
right
brisk
note
.
He
was
not
reassured
by
hearing
Bruce
Davidson
in
the
passage
cheerily
observing
to
Catherine
that
she
was
looking
a
bittie
pale
;
was
it
just
the
London
air
,
or
had
she
been
burning
the
candle
at
both
ends
?
He
let
a
dignified
minute
pass
before
going
out
himself
,
collecting
Catherine
,
and
dispatching
Bruce
to
supervise
the
house-to-house
interviews
in
Malplaquet
Terrace
,
to
see
if
anyone
could
be
found
who
had
seen
the
blue
BMW
arrive
or
caught
sight
of
its
driver
.
McLeish
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
interview
room
and
looked
in
through
the
spy-hole
,
wanting
to
get
some
feel
for
the
evidently
hostile
and
,
by
all
accounts
,
neurotic
Penelope
Huntley
.
His
first
sight
of
her
was
reassuringly
normal
:
a
tall
,
dark
girl
dressed
in
a
good
grey
suit
of
the
type
favoured
by
Francesca
,
which
acted
effectively
as
a
uniform
without
doing
much
for
her
.
An
expensive
handbag
lay
on
the
table
,
and
she
was
reading
the
morning
paper
in
a
perfectly
ordinary
way
.
But
as
she
lifted
her
head
to
greet
them
,
McLeish
decided
the
first
impression
had
been
false
.
Her
hair
was
lank
,
her
skin
blotchy
and
spotty
.
She
was
evidently
a
heavy
smoker
for
the
first
two
fingers
of
her
right
hand
were
stained
with
nicotine
,
and
,
now
that
he
looked
,
the
nails
were
bitten
and
the
cuticles
chewed
raw
.
She
looked
as
if
she
had
just
got
out
of
bed
,
and
McLeish
had
a
sudden
vision
of
a
dark
basement
flat
with
greasy
mugs
on
every
surface
.
She
looked
both
wary
and
defiant
;
well
,
people
often
did
,
faced
with
the
police
,
but
it
was
an
unusual
combination
to
find
in
a
girl
from
the
confident
middle
class
.
"
Is
it
not
warm
enough
in
here
?
"
he
enquired
by
way
of
greeting
,
seeing
her
clasping
her
jacket
round
her
.
Penelope
Huntley
let
go
of
it
anxiously
and
said
no
,
that
it
was
perfectly
fine
,
she
'd
just
been
cold
outside
.
McLeish
took
her
briskly
through
the
course
,
making
the
now
familiar
speech
about
Angela
Morgan
's
death
being
treated
as
a
case
of
murder
,
which
meant
taking
statements
from
everyone
who
had
been
associated
with
her
and
might
be
helpful
.
Penelope
Huntley
sat
silent
through
this
speech
,
chain-smoking
,
her
eyes
downcast
.
In
the
end
he
stopped
talking
and
watched
her
till
she
looked
at
him
,
sideways
and
warily
.
"
In
the
course
of
this
process
we
have
talked
to
Miss
Morgan
's
solicitor
,
who
told
us
that
she
was
the
life
tenant
of
a
substantial
estate
,
and
that
you
are
what
they
call
the
remainder-man
.
"
"
That
is
the
correct
term
,
yes
.
It
was
my
Uncle
Bill
's
money
.
"
Well
,
that
woke
her
up
,
McLeish
thought
,
watching
the
-
restless
fingers
.
The
sight
of
a
young
woman
alternately
smoking
her
head
off
and
chewing
her
cuticles
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
.
"
I
understand
that
a
substantial
part
of
his
estate
was
left
to
Miss
Morgan
?
"
he
enquired
,
with
a
strong
feeling
of
throwing
petrol
on
to
a
fire
.
"
Yes
,
it
was
.
We
both
got
legacies
,
and
she
got
the
bulk
of
the
estate
for
her
lifetime
.
She
was
his
mistress
,
of
course
,
although
she
was
over
thirty
years
younger
than
him
.
"
She
ground
a
half-smoked
cigarette
into
the
ashtray
,
and
McLeish
was
left
with
the
feeling
that
she
would
willingly
have
done
the
same
to
the
live
flesh
of
Angela
Morgan
,
if
available
.
"
How
do
you
feel
about
that
?
"
Her
head
came
up
and
she
looked
him
in
the
eye
.
"
Well
,
it
was
his
money
,
was
n't
it
,
and
I
was
only
his
niece
.
I
was
disappointed
of
course
,
but
I
got
over
it
.
"
A
good
prepared
speech
,
McLeish
thought
,
with
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
.
In
fact
,
he
realized
,
she
had
simply
adopted
the
words
other
people
must
have
said
to
her
over
and
over
again
.
He
wondered
whether
she
had
always
been
quite
so
uncaring
of
her
appearance
or
whether
it
had
been
grief
and
rage
at
Uncle
Bill
's
defection
that
had
started
this
off
.
Not
a
very
easy
question
to
ask
.
"
Were
you
close
to
your
uncle
?
"
"
Till
she
came
along
,
"
The
answer
was
like
a
rifle
shot
,
full
of
pent-up
rage
,
and
McLeish
sat
back
.
"
You
felt
she
displaced
you
-
with
him
,
I
mean
?
"
"
Well
,
she
had
all
the
advantages
,
did
n't
she
?
"
Penelope
Huntley
was
destroying
the
remaining
cuticles
on
her
left
hand
,
a
finger
pushed
savagely
against
her
teeth
.
"
I
mean
,
she
could
go
to
bed
with
him
.
He
wanted
her
,
and
he
was
getting
old
and
silly
.
"
"
I
understand
that
he
was
sixty-two
when
he
died
,
"
McLeish
said
,
drily
.
"
It
's
not
all
that
old
.
"
"
He
was
idiotic
about
her
.
Completely
OTT
.
She
did
n't
really
care
about
him
at
all
,
she
just
wanted
his
money
.
"
McLeish
decided
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
to
suggest
that
it
would
have
hardly
been
reasonable
for
Angela
Morgan
to
expect
to
inherit
a
quick
fortune
from
a
man
of
sixty-two
.
"
They
had
no
plans
to
marry
,
then
?
"
"
Of
course
not
.
Or
she
did
n't
.
She
was
just
stringing
him
along
.
"
"
Even
though
she
would
have
been
a
rich
woman
had
she
married
him
?
"
Penelope
Huntley
looked
momentarily
disoriented
,
but
any
recognition
that
a
valid
point
had
been
made
disappeared
and
she
went
back
to
chewing
her
cuticles
.
"
You
now
,
of
course
,
come
into
possession
of
a
substantial
sum
,
following
Miss
Morgan
's
death
,
"
McLeish
observed
,
sounding
as
accusing
as
he
could
,
and
she
stopped
chewing
and
gave
him
her
full
attention
.
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
Not
anything
like
it
would
have
been
if
Uncle
Bill
had
left
it
to
me
in
the
first
place
,
because
it
will
pay
duty
twice
.
"
"
But
more
than
you
would
have
got
if
Miss
Morgan
had
agreed
to
your
suggestion
of
splitting
the
fund
up
between
you
.
"
How
did
you
know
about
that
?
Solicitors
,
I
suppose
-
if
it
was
mine
I
'll
find
new
ones
.
"
She
glared
at
McLeish
,
who
looked
deadpan
.
"
Yes
,
I
would
n't
have
got
all
that
much
,
but
she
would
n't
even
agree
to
that
,
greedy
cow
.
"
The
sudden
descent
into
abuse
took
McLeish
by
surprise
and
he
realized
he
must
have
shown
it
,
because
the
girl
literally
got
a
grip
on
herself
,
folding
her
arms
and
hunching
over
the
table
.
"
Well
,
you
've
got
it
now
,
"
he
said
crudely
,
and
watched
with
fascination
as
the
corners
of
her
mouth
tucked
in
smugly
.
"
I
'd
like
to
go
over
your
movements
with
you
for
last
Saturday
,
Sunday
and
Monday
week
,
please
,
"
he
went
on
crisply
.
Penelope
Huntley
looked
at
him
in
amazement
,
with
dawning
understanding
.
More
human
than
she
'd
looked
all
morning
,
he
thought
,
realizing
he
had
taken
against
his
witness
at
least
partly
because
she
was
alive
and
the
amusing
,
lively
,
feminine
creature
that
had
been
Angela
Morgan
was
not
.
Uncle
Bill
had
been
a
wise
man
to
leave
the
money
to
Angela
,
who
had
enjoyed
it
,
rather
than
to
this
grudging
,
bitter
,
scruffy
young
woman
.
"
I
did
n't
kill
her
,
if
that
's
what
you
mean
.
I
thought
of
it
at
one
ti
me
,
but
I
knew
I
'd
make
a
mess
of
it
.
"
She
bit
-
savagely
at
her
cuticles
again
,
and
McLeish
had
to
fight
back
the
urge
to
yell
at
her
to
stop
,
for
God
's
sake
.
"
Could
you
tell
us
where
you
were
and
what
you
were
doing
on
those
three
days
,
please
?
"
he
said
,
instead
,
levelly
and
she
gave
him
another
sideways
,
calculating
look
.
"
Including
,
please
,
names
and
addresses
of
anyone
you
spent
time
with
,
"
he
added
pleasantly
and
saw
her
understand
that
he
was
serious
and
she
had
better
get
her
act
together
.
It
seemed
to
take
an
unreasonably
long
time
and
much
bad
temper
,
evasion
and
deliberate
obfuscation
,
together
with
consultation
of
a
diary
that
appeared
to
be
alternately
blank
and
covered
with
scribbled
hieroglyphics
.
And
the
narrative
extracted
with
such
difficulty
was
not
helpful
.
Miss
Huntley
claimed
to
have
spent
the
Saturday
by
herself
in
and
around
her
flat
,
doing
a
bit
of
shopping
and
cleaning
before
meeting
a
few
friends
-
only
one
of
whom
appeared
to
have
an
address
-
and
going
on
to
a
party
around
ten
o'clock
at
night
.
A
large
party
,
in
and
out
of
which
people
had
evidently
flowed
like
water
circulating
in
a
swimming
pool
.
Sunday
was
not
much
better
;
Miss
Huntley
had
not
risen
from
her
bed
until
one
p.m.
and
had
not
left
the
flat
until
five
,
then
only
to
go
to
the
cinema
.
On
Monday
she
had
gone
to
her
job
-
improbably
she
appeared
to
be
a
supervisor
for
a
market
research
firm
-
as
usual
,
and
could
be
vouched
for
by
colleagues
there
.
Well
,
two
colleagues
anyway
.
No
,
she
did
not
own
a
car
-
could
not
afford
to
-
but
she
did
have
a
driving
licence
.
Uncle
Bill
had
run
a
car
for
her
on
his
company
while
he
was
alive
but
of
course
that
had
all
stopped
when
he
died
.
McLeish
,
who
remembered
that
she
had
been
left
£200,000
outright
,
received
this
as
further
evidence
that
the
young
woman
had
gone
into
a
massive
sulk
after
her
uncle
's
unexpected
death
.
It
was
difficult
to
tell
,
of
course
,
whether
she
had
always
possessed
an
unattractive
,
aggressive
,
sullen
personality
,
or
whether
rejection
by
her
uncle
in
favour
of
Angela
Morgan
had
tipped
her
over
into
this
behaviour
.
Perhaps
she
would
brighten
up
now
that
she
had
another
substantial
amount
of
cash
to
spend
.
He
asked
her
to
come
back
as
suited
her
to
sign
her
statement
,
and
she
made
all
kinds
of
difficulties
about
when
this
would
be
possible
.
He
finally
dealt
with
that
by
saying
briskly
that
one
of
his
staff
would
come
to
her
place
of
business
.
She
opened
her
mouth
to
argue
further
,
being
plainly
in
the
mood
to
announce
she
was
leaving
her
job
rather
than
allow
any
arrangement
to
succeed
,
but
something
about
McLeish
's
expression
checked
her
and
she
agreed
meekly
.
McLeish
saw
her
off
and
returned
to
confer
with
Catherine
.
"
You
get
all
that
?
It
'll
all
have
to
be
checked
-
you
've
got
Donalds
and
Ridley
to
do
that
.
"
He
gazed
at
her
bent
head
as
she
read
through
her
notes
,
and
she
looked
up
and
smiled
faintly
at
him
.
"
Shall
I
do
it
now
?
"
"
Not
yet
.
What
did
you
think
of
Miss
Huntley
?
What
a
bitch
,
eh
?
"
Catherine
considered
him
thoughtfully
.
"
I
was
sorry
for
her
.
Her
dad
died
,
then
her
uncle
went
off
with
someone
else
.
And
left
his
money
away
from
her
.
"
"
I
had
n't
quite
seen
it
like
that
,
"
McLeish
acknowledged
humbly
,
remembering
that
the
beautiful
woman
in
front
of
him
,
whom
you
could
not
suppose
ever
to
have
encountered
rejection
in
any
form
,
had
lost
a
father
when
young
,
and
had
been
so
little
attached
to
her
stepfather
that
she
had
left
home
at
the
earliest
opportunity
.
"
She
is
in
the
frame
,
though
?
"
he
suggested
.
"
Oh
yes
.
What
was
it
she
would
get
on
Angela
Morgan
's
death
-
about
£120,000
after
taxes
?
And
I
suppose
she
feels
she
's
won
.
I
mean
she
's
alive
,
is
n't
she
?
"
McLeish
observed
soberly
that
£120,000
and
the
death
of
a
hated
rival
seemed
a
prize
well
worth
playing
for
.
"
She
's
got
a
nasty
enough
temper
-
I
just
do
n't
myself
see
her
as
clever
or
organized
enough
to
cover
her
tracks
.
Well
,
perhaps
you
'll
find
she
has
n't
-
it
's
not
much
of
an
alibi
,
is
it
?
"
"
No
.
Gaps
all
over
Saturday
and
Sunday
-
you
reckon
Angela
was
killed
then
,
rather
than
Monday
?
"
"
I
reckon
Saturday
.
We
've
got
no
sighting
of
her
after
first
thing
Saturday
morning
.
"
Catherine
Crane
looked
at
-
him
carefully
,
and
he
grinned
at
her
.
"
Come
on
,
I
know
that
look
now
.
What
am
I
missing
?
"
She
blushed
.
"
It
's
just
that
the
only
person
who
saw
her
on
Saturday
was
the
Minister
-
Mr
Hawick
.
"
"
Why
would
he
be
lying
?
"
"
Only
if
he
was
the
murderer
and
had
actually
killed
her
earlier
.
"
McLeish
sighed
.
"
I
'd
not
forgotten
him
,
but
I
just
could
n't
see
why
he
'd
want
to
kill
her
.
He
did
n't
get
any
of
her
money
if
she
died
before
they
were
married
.
"
"
It
could
have
been
jealousy
.
Mrs
Morgan
did
think
there
was
,
or
had
been
,
something
with
her
boss
.
And
Mr
Hawick
did
n't
seem
to
me
the
kind
of
chap
who
'd
put
up
with
that
.
"
McLeish
nodded
,
not
entirely
convinced
,
but
unwilling
for
a
variety
of
reasons
to
discourage
Catherine
.
"
We
need
to
check
what
he
was
doing
those
days
,
anyway
-
I
did
n't
try
too
hard
when
we
were
last
there
,
because
I
hoped
the
autopsy
might
give
us
something
.
As
it
did
.
I
'll
get
Jenny
to
fix
it
.
"
She
nodded
,
and
he
sat
looking
at
her
until
she
looked
back
at
him
.
He
glanced
up
at
the
spy-hole
and
grinned
.
"
Let's
get
some
lunch
.
I
ca
n't
face
the
canteen
but
there
's
a
trattoria
round
the
corner
.
I
never
see
anyone
from
this
place
there
.
"
They
ate
in
the
small
crowded
Italian
restaurant
which
was
,
as
he
had
promised
,
free
of
their
New
Scotland
Yard
colleagues
.
It
was
also
free
of
DTI
civil
servants
as
he
had
quietly
ascertained
while
they
waited
for
their
lunch
to
arrive
.
They
walked
out
into
a
cold
,
bright
day
,
into
one
of
the
labyrinthine
streets
by
the
side
of
Westminster
Abbey
,
straight
into
a
column
of
knickerbockered
children
chattering
hard
and
sweeping
all
before
them
.
As
they
stood
patiently
in
a
doorway
waiting
for
the
column
to
pass
,
Catherine
turned
to
say
something
to
McLeish
and
he
looked
down
at
her
for
a
long
moment
.
"
Better
get
back
.
"
Smiling
to
himself
,
he
looked
idly
across
the
road
and
saw
Francesca
,
who
should
not
have
been
back
till
Thursday
.
She
was
not
looking
in
their
direction
,
her
head
was
turned
to
say
something
to
whomever
she
was
with
,
her
short
hair
blown
straight
up
by
the
wind
as
they
went
into
the
little
newsagent
's
,
leaving
McLeish
a
clear
run
to
get
Catherine
back
to
the
Yard
.
He
walked
heavily
beside
her
,
trying
to
convince
himself
that
Francesca
had
not
seen
them
.
But
she
had
,
of
course
she
had
;
that
was
why
she
had
fled
.
He
got
back
to
his
own
desk
and
sat
,
looking
at
his
hands
,
unable
to
decide
whether
to
ring
her
up
,
or
what
to
say
.
Mark
picked
up
another
car
at
the
London
plant
and
drove
up
the
M1
to
his
home
in
north
Buckinghamshire
.
Turning
off
the
motorway
at
the
service
station
he
entered
a
different
world
.
Driving
very
slowly
over
the
narrow
bridges
spanning
the
fast
flowing
streams
which
stemmed
from
the
River
Ouse
,
he
noticed
that
a
massive
flock
of
coots
had
flown
in
while
he
had
been
away
.
There
must
have
been
two
or
three
thousand
on
the
river
banks
and
the
water
.
Pulling
the
car
off
the
narrow
country
lane
,
Mark
pressed
the
button
which
activated
the
power-operated
windows
.
It
was
early
evening
and
very
still
.
Soft
white
clouds
remained
motionless
against
an
azure
blue
sky
.
Between
the
many
breaks
in
the
cloud
the
rays
of
a
thin
evening
sun
shafted
down
at
an
acute
angle
to
spotlight
the
pastoral
scene
.
Away
to
the
west
a
flock
of
Canada
geese
was
heading
home
to
descend
on
one
of
the
larger
lakes
in
the
distance
.
In
the
foreground
another
smaller
flock
was
taking
off
from
the
little
lake
on
the
south
side
.
Squawking
madly
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
family
squabble
over
the
direction
they
should
take
,
they
suddenly
closed
ranks
,
as
if
by
order
,
and
formed
a
perfect
vee
behind
their
leader
.
They
then
wheeled
in
unison
into
a
shaft
of
light
which
held
them
for
a
second
or
so
before
they
soared
over
the
car
and
away
.
Standing
in
shallow
water
amongst
the
tall
reeds
on
the
banks
of
the
river
,
Mark
counted
eight
herons
,
all
motionless
,
their
necks
inclined
upwards
at
precisely
the
same
angle
,
as
if
in
silent
prayer
.
On
the
river
banks
to
the
east
,
mallard
and
teal
were
pecking
away
at
their
undercarriages
and
,
in
the
meadow
flanking
the
lane
,
two
hares
were
squaring
up
.
High
overhead
,
barely
visible
or
audible
,
a
jumbo
jet
began
its
gentle
descent
to
Heathrow
.
Mark
looked
up
at
the
tiny
speck
in
the
stratosphere
and
imagined
he
could
hear
the
air
hostess
requesting
passengers
to
fasten
their
seat
belts
.
He
looked
again
at
the
beautifully
unspoiled
Buckinghamshire
countryside
.
It
was
great
to
be
home
again
.
He
drove
leisurely
up
the
country
lane
and
ascended
the
hill
,
before
bearing
left
along
the
escarpment
.
Away
in
the
distance
,
tucked
between
a
fold
in
the
surrounding
hills
,
was
home
.
Mark
always
experienced
the
same
feelings
of
contentment
when
entering
the
home
straight
.
Today
he
felt
particularly
pleased
to
be
back
.
Gently
nosing
the
car
down
the
hill
into
the
village
,
he
turned
off
the
road
into
the
gravelled
drive
which
led
to
the
eighteenth-century
stone
barn
.
Hearing
the
wheels
of
the
car
on
the
gravel
the
two
young
golden
retriever
bitches
,
Honey
and
the
pick
of
the
litter
,
Harriet
,
bounded
through
the
hall
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
intruder
from
the
dining-room
window
.
Standing
on
their
hind
legs
with
front
paws
resting
on
the
deep
window
sills
,
they
saw
Mark
getting
out
of
his
car
and
went
berserk
.
Racing
back
into
the
hall
with
tails
wagging
furiously
,
they
almost
knocked
Georgina
over
.
She
had
also
heard
a
car
come
up
the
drive
,
and
was
heading
through
the
hall
to
the
porch
.
She
opened
the
heavy
oak
doors
and
the
dogs
swept
past
her
bounding
across
the
drive
to
their
master
who
was
opening
up
the
car
boot
to
remove
his
luggage
.
Mark
turned
,
just
as
the
dogs
took
off
together
in
a
huge
leap
which
struck
him
in
the
chest
,
knocking
him
backwards
into
the
boot
where
he
sat
,
legs
dangling
,
with
both
arms
wrapped
around
the
excited
dogs
.
Looking
up
,
he
saw
Georgina
standing
at
the
open
door
with
a
welcoming
smile
.
"
Hello
,
darling
,
"
he
called
waving
with
his
right
hand
while
trying
to
keep
the
dogs
at
bay
with
his
left
.
"
Welcome
home
,
sweetheart
!
"
She
flung
her
arms
around
him
.
"
Such
a
long
time
!
"
she
gasped
in
his
ear
as
they
hugged
each
other
tightly
,
the
dogs
retiring
a
respectful
distance
to
sit
and
watch
the
homecoming
with
tails
swishing
excitedly
over
the
gravel
.
"
I
've
missed
you
so
much
,
this
time
,
"
she
told
him
breathlessly
.
"
Ca
n't
think
why
.
Really
forgotten
what
you
look
like
.
Let's
have
a
look
at
you
.
Hum
,
not
bad
,
considering
your
age
and
everything
I
suppose
-
.
"
"
It
s
great
to
be
home
,
darling
.
I
've
missed
you
too
,
"
he
whispered
in
her
ear
.
"
Do
n't
know
why
I
feel
this
way
.
Must
be
Spring
!
"
During
Mark
's
absence
in
Spain
,
"
the
mole
"
Fred
Klepner
had
spent
countless
hours
going
over
the
Ten
Year
Business
plan
which
was
to
be
the
subject
of
the
presentation
Mark
was
to
give
to
Nate
Cocello
at
the
next
Planning
Committee
meeting
.
Klepner
had
studied
the
plan
with
a
sense
of
shock
.
He
had
arrived
in
Europe
knowing
nothing
about
the
European
motor
industry
or
the
Continent
's
political
and
economic
environment
,
except
from
what
he
had
read
on
the
subject
at
Harvard
Business
School
and
in
Detroit
Central
Office
reports
.
He
had
been
under
the
erroneous
impression
that
Europe
was
just
one
big
common
market
,
similar
in
size
to
the
United
States
,
operating
under
free
trade
concepts
,
and
with
common
laws
,
rules
and
regulations
.
He
had
therefore
assumed
that
the
preparation
of
a
European
plan
would
be
broadly
similar
to
the
planning
practices
normally
followed
in
the
United
States
.
In
consequence
,
he
had
read
the
two
hundred
page
European
Plan
with
open-mouthed
incredulity
.
It
was
a
totally
different
planning
world
from
the
United
States
.
The
plan
was
also
prepared
in
a
different
way
from
those
drafted
by
the
US
divisions
,
as
it
had
to
be
to
give
proper
consideration
to
the
problems
and
needs
of
a
totally
different
planning
environment
.
For
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
Harvard
Business
School
of
Management
Klepner
now
began
to
have
a
glimmer
of
understanding
of
the
many
important
practical
differences
between
Europe
and
the
United
States
.
The
first
section
of
the
plan
developed
all
the
major
assumptions
upon
which
it
was
based
.
These
assumptions
detailed
the
principal
factors
under
separate
headings
,
such
as
Political
,
Economic
,
Technical
,
Commercial
,
Environmental
,
Energy
and
so
on
.
These
headings
were
then
broken
down
to
test
the
assumptions
by
critical
analysis
,
country
by
country
identifying
the
common
European
factors
and
the
variables
.
In
developing
the
short
list
of
manufacturing
locations
he
proposed
to
establish
to
produce
the
new
products
which
would
incorporate
all
the
latest
technologies
,
he
had
detailed
the
comparative
costs
of
manufacture
per
country
and
identified
the
economic
and
commercial
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
selling
components
into
specific
European
countries
from
single
and
dual
manufacturing
sources
.
It
was
patently
obvious
to
Klepner
,
now
that
he
had
read
the
plan
,
that
the
European
trade
environment
was
not
as
he
had
been
led
to
believe
.
He
spent
the
entire
first
week
reading
the
plan
over
and
over
again
.
Two
days
before
Mark
returned
to
England
,
Klepner
spent
a
whole
day
with
Muldoon
going
over
the
plan
.
The
upshot
of
this
meeting
was
that
Muldoon
phoned
Mueller
and
Klepner
was
on
the
next
plane
to
Detroit
with
photostat
copies
of
Mark
's
plan
,
for
Mueller
's
eyes
only
.
Mark
arrived
at
his
office
expecting
to
have
a
few
clear
days
ahead
to
finalise
the
European
Business
Plan
and
prepare
his
presentation
to
Cocello
.
But
it
did
n't
happen
that
way
.
He
received
an
internal
phone
call
from
Muldoon
,
who
told
him
that
McGillicuddy
wanted
him
to
go
on
to
Dublin
immediately
.
The
Irish
Prime
Minister
had
evidently
made
a
personal
approach
to
his
compatriot
,
the
Chairman
of
United
Motors
,
Tom
O'Reilly
,
pleading
for
more
American
investment
to
help
the
"
auld
counthrie
"
.
The
Irish
never
allowed
their
expatriates
to
forget
the
debt
they
owed
the
Emerald
Isle
.
United
Motors
had
already
built
a
component
plant
in
Dublin
a
few
years
before
,
at
the
specific
request
of
the
Chairman
,
but
it
had
never
operated
profitably
.
It
had
been
plagued
by
excessive
absenteeism
,
restrictive
practices
,
inter-union
demarcation
lines
and
poor
product
quality
.
Mark
's
quarterly
reports
which
highlighted
the
plant
problems
were
not
well
received
by
the
Chairman
-
according
to
his
personal
staff
.
"
You
do
n't
win
any
medals
by
questioning
the
Chairman
's
judgement
,
Mark
"
said
his
personal
assistant
,
advising
him
to
"
tone
it
down
a
bit
"
in
future
Dublin
plant
reports
.
Notwithstanding
the
plant
's
poor
track
record
,
Tom
O'Reilly
considered
it
to
be
his
bounden
duty
to
respond
to
the
call
for
help
from
his
compatriot
,
the
Irish
Prime
Minister
,
and
so
he
phoned
McGillicuddy
,
who
readily
agreed
,
and
Mark
was
instructed
to
contact
the
PM
's
office
.
There
were
,
in
fact
,
many
Irish
Americans
in
United
Motors
at
high
management
levels
,
all
of
whom
had
a
nostalgic
affection
for
the
"
auld
counthrie
"
,
and
indeed
for
anything
Irish
;
but
that
was
because
most
of
them
had
never
actually
been
there
.
The
majority
preferred
to
believe
the
picturesque
stories
passed
down
by
parents
and
grandparents
,
which
were
,
of
course
,
accepted
as
the
gospel
truth
.
The
Chairman
,
for
example
,
was
one
of
no
fewer
than
five
Irish
Americans
to
have
held
the
top
job
in
UM
.
Tom
O'Reilly
was
an
ascetic
former
Treasurer
of
the
Corporation
who
had
been
never
known
to
smile
even
when
the
company
's
blue
chip
shares
soared
to
dizzy
peaks
on
Wall
Street
.
It
was
,
however
,
reported
by
his
personal
staff
that
he
did
manage
a
smirk
when
he
had
been
told
the
story
of
how
his
arch
rival
and
competitor
had
been
conned
by
his
countrymen
on
a
flag-flying
visit
to
the
auld
counthrie
.
He
had
agreed
to
make
a
financial
contribution
of
$50,000
from
the
family
trust
to
help
finance
a
social
club
to
be
named
after
him
.
The
local
paper
made
a
front
page
headline
of
"
Henry
's
magnificent
$590,000
gift
.
The
motor
magnate
was
furious
and
rang
the
Editor
to
say
so
,
whereupon
the
latter
apologised
profusely
adding
that
he
would
make
a
front
page
correction
in
the
next
day
's
edition
.
Henry
surrendered
.
Some
two
years
later
,
on
completion
of
the
social
club
,
the
magnate
was
asked
if
he
would
like
something
suitable
inscribed
over
the
portal
.
"
Yeah
,
"
replied
the
motor
man
irritably
,
"
you
can
say
"
I
came
amongst
you
and
you
took
me
in
"
.
"
Tom
O'Reilly
liked
that
story
.
It
actually
made
him
smirk
-
so
it
was
said
.
The
UM
Chairman
was
cast
from
a
similar
mould
but
with
coarser
ingredients
.
O'Reilly
was
impossible
to
please
and
suspicious
of
everybody
and
everything
.
He
trusted
nobody
,
not
even
fellow
Catholics
on
the
Board
.
But
if
it
could
be
said
that
he
did
have
a
weakness
for
something
,
it
was
for
Ireland
and
the
Irish
.
Mark
could
ill-afford
to
be
away
from
his
office
with
the
presentation
to
Cocello
looming
large
on
the
horizon
,
but
the
next
day
he
was
on
his
way
to
Dublin
.
The
taxi
crossed
the
Liffey
and
made
its
way
down
O'Connell
Street
to
Government
House
.
The
talkative
driver
had
n't
stopped
chatting
from
the
moment
Mark
had
entered
the
cab
.
He
was
better
than
a
music-hall
turn
.
There
was
no
question
of
doubt
but
that
the
Irish
had
been
blessed
with
the
gift
of
the
Blarney
.
Most
of
them
could
express
themselves
with
a
lilting
eloquence
which
left
the
English
spellbound
.
Who
was
it
who
said
that
the
Irish
took
the
English
language
and
threw
the
words
up
in
the
air
just
to
see
how
they
all
sparkled
as
they
came
tumbling
down
?
Mark
's
meeting
with
the
Irish
Minister
of
Industry
and
his
loquacious
officials
was
pure
theatre
.
The
problems
experienced
by
United
Motors
at
its
Dublin
plant
,
which
the
Englishman
advised
were
the
major
factors
which
would
influence
future
investment
decisions
in
Ireland
,
simply
melted
away
into
insignificance
under
their
mellifluous
tongues
.
They
had
excuses
,
or
as
they
preferred
to
describe
them
,
fair
and
reasonable
explanations
,
for
all
the
problems
which
had
beset
the
Dublin
plant
.
The
exceptionally
high
absenteeism
on
Mondays
and
Fridays
,
which
necessitated
employing
thirty
per
cent
more
workers
than
was
economically
justified
,
was
not
so
much
caused
by
the
demon
drink
;
but
because
-
etcetera
,
etcetera
-
.
The
reason
why
timekeeping
was
particularly
bad
on
Tuesdays
,
Wednesdays
and
Thursdays
,
when
employees
did
turn
up
for
work
,
was
because
the
buses
were
so
unreliable
.
The
local
transport
authority
simply
could
n't
get
spare
parts
from
the
British
to
keep
the
buses
on
the
roads
.
If
only
the
British
would
pull
their
socks
up
things
would
be
different
.
The
reason
why
absenteeism
was
non-existent
on
Thursdays
was
not
just
because
it
happened
to
be
pay
day
.
Ah
ha
,
no
;
it
was
n't
quite
as
simple
as
all
that
,
do
n't
you
know
,
although
of
course
it
was
an
incentive
day
,
and
the
Irish
loved
incentives
.
Regarding
the
strikes
,
disputes
and
restrictive
practices
which
had
plagued
the
Dublin
plant
,
these
were
all
unfortunate
legacies
of
the
British
system
which
had
been
foisted
upon
the
Irish
since
before
the
First
World
War
.
The
Irish
Government
was
resolutely
determined
to
rid
itself
of
the
British
system
which
had
done
so
much
harm
to
the
economy
.
When
Mark
reminded
them
that
the
plant
was
relatively
new
and
that
with
the
exception
of
the
American
Managing
Director
and
Treasurer
,
was
manned
throughout
by
Irish
men
and
women
,
they
countered
with
,
"
Ah
yes
,
but
it
's
the
Trade
unions
,
you
see
.
"
And
when
he
pointed
out
that
these
were
Irish
,
not
British
Trade
unions
they
were
talking
about
,
it
was
sadly
admitted
that
the
English
disease
had
poisoned
the
minds
of
many
impressionable
Irish
trade
unionists
and
that
it
would
of
course
take
time
entirely
to
eradicate
malign
English
influences
from
the
land
of
Saints
and
Scholars
.
To
be
sure
,
unemployment
was
a
mortal
sin
to
shame
all
good
Christians
and
the
Government
was
appealing
to
international
companies
to
help
solve
the
problem
.
Meantime
,
it
would
greatly
help
if
United
Motors
could
see
its
way
clear
to
build
another
factory
in
Ireland
,
particularly
if
it
could
be
built
in
the
South
West
,
where
the
Prime
Minister
was
having
to
face
re-election
in
a
year
's
time
.
Very
generous
financial
assistance
would
be
given
by
the
Government
,
in
the
form
of
a
grant
of
up
to
thirty
per
cent
of
capital
and
remission
of
all
taxation
on
export
sales
for
ten
years
.
The
fact
that
in
the
whole
of
South
West
Ireland
there
was
not
sufficient
labour
to
man
a
new
United
Motors
plant
was
not
seen
by
the
Minister
as
any
kind
of
problem
;
simply
as
a
little
local
difficulty
.
Later
that
morning
he
was
flown
to
the
South
West
and
shown
a
beautiful
industrial
site
with
excellent
access
to
the
adjacent
port
facilities
.
Unfortunately
it
had
just
been
earmarked
for
housing
.
There
was
,
however
,
another
very
similar
site
in
the
area
,
which
was
really
better
than
the
site
they
had
already
seen
.
The
trouble
was
that
nobody
could
quite
remember
where
it
was
exactly
,
but
everybody
knew
it
was
around
there
somewhere
,
that
's
for
sure
.
So
they
all
went
off
to
lunch
with
the
mayor
,
while
a
messenger
was
sent
to
the
Registrar
of
Births
,
Marriages
and
Deaths
to
get
the
necessary
information
.
Mark
had
often
said
to
his
American
colleagues
in
Detroit
and
New
York
that
the
sales
'
promotion
literature
put
out
by
the
Irish
Development
Authority
to
attract
internationally
mobile
inward
investment
was
superior
to
anything
produced
by
any
other
European
country
.
Unfortunately
the
practical
problems
of
operating
a
large
plant
in
Ireland
were
totally
unrelated
to
the
glowing
words
in
the
glossy
literature
,
and
to
the
enchanting
phrases
which
slid
so
eloquently
off
the
honeyed
tongues
of
Ministers
and
officials
.
In
reality
,
the
unhappy
experiences
of
United
Motors
at
its
Dublin
plant
had
effectively
ensured
that
no
major
future
expansion
would
be
undertaken
in
that
enigmatic
country
for
many
years
.
Cocello
would
effectively
see
to
that
,
whatever
Chairman
Tom
O'Reilly
might
think
.
When
the
Minister
had
ended
the
meeting
with
the
words
,
"
Now
,
Mr
Sanders
,
what
can
we
do
to
persuade
you
to
put
more
investment
in
Ireland
?
"
the
Englishman
had
replied
,
"
The
best
advocate
you
could
have
,
Minister
,
to
influence
more
investment
in
your
country
,
is
a
local
plant
manager
who
consistently
turns
in
good
results
,
year
after
year
.
"
Such
a
man
,
with
a
good
track
record
can
fight
for
his
plant
and
his
people
on
the
very
strong
grounds
that
investment
in
his
region
has
been
proven
to
be
successful
.
"
Our
Dublin
plant
has
consistently
failed
to
produce
the
expected
results
,
and
it
is
this
unfortunate
experience
which
will
weigh
heavily
against
any
further
investment
in
Eire
;
in
much
the
same
way
as
it
has
weighed
heavily
against
the
UK
.
The
most
eloquent
advocates
in
United
Motors
,
Minister
,
are
those
with
beautiful
bottom
lines
,
"
said
the
Englishman
.
The
executive
jet
took
off
from
Cork
airport
and
landed
at
Dublin
in
the
late
afternoon
.
Mark
was
driven
to
the
Gresham
Hotel
by
the
head
of
the
development
authority
.
On
the
way
he
stopped
the
car
in
the
city
centre
to
point
out
dozens
of
parking
meters
,
all
capped
with
hooded
covers
.
"
Now
I
'd
like
to
show
you
sometin'
which
I
'm
sure
you
would
appreciate
,
"
he
said
pleasantly
,
wagging
a
finger
at
the
objects
ahead
.
"
Now
you
see
all
dose
little
parking
meters
dere
,
snoozing
under
dose
little
black
sleeping
caps
?
Well
a
few
weeks
ago
the
city
fathers
installed
dose
nasty
little
tings
at
a
cost
,
believe
it
or
not
,
sir
,
of
some
turty
tree
tousand
pounds
,
and
the
day
atterwards
dey
declared
the
whole
area
a
no
waiting
zone
.
"
He
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
with
laughter
.
"
Now
is
n't
dat
Irish
,
Mr
Sanders
?
"
he
exclaimed
enjoying
the
joke
on
himself
,
which
was
one
of
the
more
agreeable
characteristics
the
Irish
had
in
common
with
the
English
.
Mark
then
told
him
of
the
occasion
when
he
had
been
driving
down
O'Connell
Street
some
twenty
or
so
years
before
,
when
he
had
inadvertently
misunderstood
the
hand
signals
of
the
policeman
on
traffic
duty
,
and
had
moved
off
before
he
had
been
cleared
to
do
so
.
The
policeman
had
ordered
him
to
stop
by
his
foot
.
"
You
are
English
,
are
you
not
,
Sor
?
"
he
had
asked
with
haughty
disdain
.
"
Sure
,
I
taut
so
,
"
he
added
.
"
Now
sor
,
is
dis
your
first
rime
in
Dublin
?
Ah
it
is
.
For
sure
dat
explains
it
all
!
"
Then
pulling
himself
up
to
a
great
height
,
he
went
on
.
"
Now
sor
,
I
'm
goin'
to
be
tellin'
yer
sometin'
.
If
you'se
happen
to
be
comin'
here
to
Dublin
at
some
time
or
other
in
the
future
-
which
praise
the
Lord
you
will
be
,
for
t
is
God
's
own
city
-
and
you
happen
to
be
driving
down
O'Connell
Street
and
you
see
me
standin'
here
like
dis
,
with
me
arms
up
;
then
whether
I
'm
here
or
not
,
you
stop
.
"
He
had
stood
there
with
left
arm
aloft
and
right
arm
horizontal
and
remained
in
that
statuesque
position
for
some
thirty
seconds
.
"
Now
,
is
dat
understood
,
sor
?
Fine
,
then
be
off
with
you
and
may
God
give
you
a
good
day
.
"
The
other
Ireland
raised
its
ugly
head
at
Dublin
airport
.
Mark
's
name
had
been
called
over
the
loudspeaker
system
.
He
answered
the
phone
to
be
told
by
an
anonymous
member
of
the
IRA
that
he
should
n't
attempt
to
return
to
Ireland
if
United
Motors
decided
against
further
investment
in
that
country
.
Once
again
the
sharp
contrast
was
drawn
between
the
charming
and
friendly
people
one
came
across
in
everyday
life
and
the
murdering
hate
of
the
evil
terrorist
minority
who
eagerly
blew
innocent
men
,
women
and
children
to
Kingdom
come
.
While
Mark
was
in
Dublin
the
head
of
the
French
Development
Authority
DATAR
paid
a
courtesy
visit
to
Detroit
to
make
the
point
to
Nate
Cocello
,
and
Chairman
,
Tom
O'Reilly
that
France
was
keen
to
attract
very
much
more
United
Motors
investment
.
The
fact
that
France
had
already
received
the
lion
's
share
of
new
European
component
investment
over
the
previous
five
years
was
beside
the
point
.
That
was
past
.
France
wanted
the
lion
's
share
of
all
future
European
investment
too
,
and
was
most
concerned
to
hear
that
the
Corporation
was
also
considering
investment
in
Spain
,
Portugal
,
Austria
,
Ireland
and
the
UK
.
It
was
put
to
the
two
top
men
and
to
the
Vice
President
in
charge
of
Overseas
'
Operations
that
the
interests
of
France
could
only
be
adequately
served
by
Frenchmen
,
and
not
by
Americans
or
Englishmen
.
The
fact
that
Sanders
,
an
Englishman
,
had
produced
the
plan
which
had
changed
French
plants
from
ailing
and
unprofitable
operations
in
the
sixties
,
into
expanding
and
profitable
divisions
in
the
seventies
was
discreetly
overlooked
.
Mark
had
actually
transferred
certain
expanding
and
profitable
product
lines
and
manufacturing
facilities
from
the
UK
to
France
to
consolidate
a
new
range
of
components
at
French
locations
.
All
hell
would
have
been
let
loose
by
the
French
plants
and
the
French
Government
if
the
boot
had
been
on
the
other
foot
and
anyone
had
attempted
to
transfer
products
and
facilities
from
France
to
the
UK
.
The
top
men
had
listened
courteously
to
their
visitor
's
observations
and
requests
without
reaction
.
Under
his
breath
,
the
Vice
President
was
telling
him
to
get
stuffed
.
The
French
Government
would
object
to
Jesus
Christ
being
head
of
European
Operations
,
on
the
grounds
that
He
was
n't
a
Frenchman
.
In
his
capacity
as
world-wide
planning
coordinator
,
Mueller
had
been
invited
by
Nate
Cocello
to
attend
the
meeting
as
an
observer
.
He
had
listened
to
DATAR
"
s
views
with
great
interest
,
and
from
a
totally
different
viewpoint
to
that
of
the
Vice
President
.
Mueller
wanted
to
bring
world
planning
under
his
personal
direction
and
control
from
Detroit
.
He
could
understand
-
so
he
said
to
the
top
brass
after
the
Frenchman
had
departed
-
why
the
French
took
exception
to
an
Englishman
holding
such
a
key
position
in
Europe
.
He
could
also
understand
why
they
objected
to
London
being
the
European
headquarters
of
United
Motors
.
Chairman
Tom
O'Reilly
took
a
similar
view
but
for
different
reasons
.
He
had
been
against
the
choice
of
London
as
the
location
for
European
Headquarters
when
he
had
been
Treasurer
.
As
an
active
supporter
of
the
"
Irish
cause
"
he
hated
Britain
and
the
British
.
"
I
guess
those
European
Government
bastards
would
object
wherever
we
located
European
headquarters
,
"
said
Cocello
.
"
The
French
hate
London
,
but
they
would
also
object
to
Bonn
,
Rome
,
Brussels
-
you
name
it
.
It
would
still
be
wrong
until
you
mentioned
Paris
.
Then
it
would
be
right
.
"
"
The
same
goes
,
I
guess
,
for
other
Governments
,
,
said
the
Chairman
.
"
There
is
no
single
acceptable
location
,
as
they
see
it
,
unless
it
is
in
their
own
country
.
The
French
hate
London
and
the
British
,
but
then
,
who
does
n't
?
"
he
added
maliciously
.
"
Waal
,
,
rejoined
Cocello
.
"
If
the
Europeans
fight
like
hell
over
new
investment
and
where
European
headquarters
should
be
,
maybe
we
should
consider
running
everything
from
here
in
Detroit
,
the
way
it
used
to
be
.
We
could
do
it
,
of
course
.
"
"
Sure
could
,
"
added
Mueller
eagerly
,
and
received
a
look
of
cold
disapproval
from
the
Vice
President
in
charge
of
Overseas
'
Operations
for
his
unwarranted
opinion
.
"
Well
,
why
do
n't
we
chew
on
it
a
bit
?
"
asked
the
ageing
Chairman
.
"
Maybe
we
should
,
"
replied
the
President
and
Chief
Executive
Officer
.
"
Randy
,
would
you
put
down
something
for
discussion
by
the
Executive
Committee
?
"
"
Yes
sir
,
Will
do
.
"
Mark
Sanders
spent
the
next
few
days
in
his
office
,
working
late
into
the
night
to
finalise
the
ten
year
European
Business
Plan
and
to
summarise
the
massive
document
into
a
sixty
minute
presentation
illustrated
by
thirty
slides
.
Fred
Klepner
had
been
in
and
out
of
both
Mark
's
and
Pat
Muldoon
's
offices
,
which
were
only
a
few
yards
apart
,
like
an
eager
beaver
.
He
would
grab
a
completed
section
of
the
overall
plan
from
Mark
's
private
secretary
just
as
soon
as
she
had
typed
it
,
and
dash
off
to
his
own
office
down
the
corridor
to
study
it
carefully
many
times
over
,
before
taking
it
along
to
Muldoon
to
keep
him
in
the
picture
.
Klepner
played
the
usual
corporate
cat
and
mouse
game
of
making
at
least
one
or
two
word
changes
on
each
and
every
page
so
that
his
own
secretary
could
re-type
each
page
under
her
initials
and
the
initials
"
FK
"
.
This
practice
achieved
twin
objectives
.
It
gave
the
European
plan
anonymity
by
not
identifying
the
author
of
the
plan
,
while
his
own
copy
under
his
own
initials
and
those
of
his
secretary
would
tell
Mueller
and
his
Detroit
colleagues
that
he
had
a
hand
in
its
formulation
,
which
is
what
Mueller
and
Muldoon
wanted
people
to
think
.
As
presentation
day
grew
closer
with
Mark
racing
against
time
to
complete
the
plan
and
finalise
the
slide
illustrations
,
so
Klepner
read
and
re-read
it
until
he
had
almost
learnt
it
off
by
heart
.
So
complete
was
his
total
immersion
in
the
subject
that
he
actually
began
to
believe
that
he
had
assisted
Sanders
in
the
plan
's
preparation
.
His
delusions
were
those
of
a
messenger
boy
who
assumes
that
because
he
takes
the
Chief
Architect
's
drawings
to
the
print
room
,
he
has
played
a
leading
role
in
the
design
of
the
building
.
A
few
days
before
the
European
Planning
Committee
was
due
to
meet
,
Mueller
decided
to
go
for
the
jugular
.
His
suggestion
that
United
Motors
should
progressively
wind
up
its
European
,
South
American
and
Asian
regional
headquarters
and
plan
,
direct
and
control
world
operations
from
its
home
base
in
Detroit
,
had
been
well-received
by
most
of
the
top
brass
who
liked
the
big
bold
approach
of
running
the
world
the
way
it
used
to
be
-
from
Detroit
.
They
were
under
no
illusions
that
they
could
do
a
better
job
from
Detroit
,
but
they
had
become
increasingly
concerned
that
they
were
getting
out
of
touch
with
what
was
happening
around
the
world
,
and
that
the
tail
was
beginning
to
wag
the
dog
.
The
European
zone
,
for
example
,
was
growing
twice
as
fast
as
the
United
States
'
zone
,
and
now
employed
a
quarter
of
a
million
people
.
This
situation
went
against
the
grain
,
as
the
top
brass
always
needed
to
be
on
top
of
every
situation
and
on
top
of
every
executive
if
they
were
to
do
their
jobs
to
their
own
satisfaction
;
not
necessarily
in
the
best
interests
of
the
Corporation
,
that
is
to
say
,
but
in
their
own
best
interests
.
Mueller
's
proposals
appeared
to
be
more
in
tune
with
their
own
thoughts
at
that
particular
time
.
For
this
reason
he
was
given
the
green
light
to
prepare
more
detailed
proposals
for
further
consideration
.
Confident
in
the
knowledge
that
he
now
had
the
general
support
of
most
of
the
top
brass
to
his
world
control
plan
,
Mueller
considered
that
he
was
now
in
a
much
stronger
position
to
start
pulling
the
rug
out
from
under
the
Regional
Area
Managers
.
And
,
as
the
biggest
zone
by
far
was
Europe
,
he
would
begin
there
.
His
plan
to
appoint
Klepner
to
succeed
Sanders
as
European
Planning
Manager
,
based
on
Detroit
rather
than
London
,
was
working
out
to
perfection
.
Klepner
had
been
doing
everything
that
was
expected
of
him
acting
as
Mueller
's
eyes
and
ears
in
Europe
.
It
was
now
necessary
to
give
Klepner
visibility
in
front
of
Cocello
and
the
top
brass
.
Muldoon
was
no
problem
.
He
would
n't
mind
taking
early
retirement
.
He
was
over
sixty
and
a
relatively
wealthy
man
,
with
a
wife
who
was
financially
independent
.
He
would
welcome
the
chance
of
retiring
to
his
yachts
.
McGillicuddy
would
n't
relish
the
idea
of
giving
up
the
General
Director
's
job
as
European
overlord
,
but
he
was
also
sixty
and
could
be
kicked
upstairs
for
a
year
or
so
before
taking
early
retirement
.
H
e
certainly
would
n't
be
short
of
a
dollar
or
two
.
Sanders
was
a
bit
of
a
problem
.
He
was
in
his
early
fifties
and
could
n't
be
retired
early
,
except
on
a
very
much
reduced
company
pension
.
But
-
so
what
?
He
could
count
himself
lucky
to
have
got
where
he
had
got
in
an
all-American
company
.
He
could
be
offered
an
MD
job
in
one
of
the
UK
divisions
which
he
would
obviously
turn
down
;
but
so
what
!
From
now
on
the
locals
would
do
what
they
were
told
to
do
by
Detroit
,
and
if
they
did
n't
like
it
they
could
take
the
option
of
either
getting
out
of
their
own
free
will
,
or
being
booted
out
.
He
'd
had
enough
of
all
that
European
political
crap
about
overseas
subsidiaries
also
having
to
represent
the
interests
of
the
local
host
country
where
United
Motors
had
a
manufacturing
presence
.
Bullshit
.
Their
one
and
only
interest
was
to
serve
the
interest
of
the
Corporation
in
the
US
of
A
and
anyone
in
a
top
position
overseas
who
did
n't
understand
that
number
one
lesson
would
soon
have
his
nose
put
out
of
joint
.
From
here
on
in
,
Randy
Mueller
was
going
to
start
calling
the
shots
.
He
reckoned
that
his
chances
of
making
the
Presidency
before
he
was
sixty
were
now
better
than
ever
.
He
should
make
a
Vice
Presidency
within
five
,
the
Presidency
within
ten
.
President
Randy
Mueller
,
the
all-American
boy
who
had
made
it
from
right
here
in
his
little
ole
home
town
of
Detroit
.
He
rose
from
his
enormous
desk
and
lit
a
big
cigar
-
it
could
n't
have
been
a
Havana
-
and
strutted
around
his
vast
office
like
a
peacock
,
admiring
his
reflection
in
the
long
mirror
.
Randy
loved
himself
and
everything
he
stood
for
.
It
was
surely
great
to
be
an
American
going
up
in
the
greatest
company
in
the
world
and
in
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
.
God
bless
America
,
and
piss
on
the
rest
.
He
walked
to
the
phone
,
pausing
on
the
way
to
take
another
admiring
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror
.
"
Miss
Kopensky
,
"
he
barked
.
"
Yes
,
Mr
Mueller
,
sir
.
"
"
Get
me
Muldoon
.
"
"
Yes
sir
,
right
away
,
sir
.
"
"
And
Miss
Kopensky
.
"
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
"
Have
a
nice
day
,
Miss
Kopensky
.
"
"
Thank
you
,
sir
;
have
a
nice
day
yourself
,
sir
.
"
"
I
will
,
Miss
Kopensky
,
I
will
.
"
"
Mr
Muldoon
on
the
line
,
sir
.
"
Hi
ya
Pat
buddy
boy
.
Happy
Thanksgiving
.
"
"
You
're
a
bit
earl
Randy
You
puttin'
the
clock
forward
?
,
"
You
could
put
it
that
way
.
A
long
way
forward
.
"
"
I
do
n't
get
it
.
"
"
No
buster
,
but
you
will
,
you
will
.
"
"
Quit
stallin
around
Randy
,
will
ya
.
What
is
it
?
"
"
We
got
ourselves
a
new
ball
park
,
"
said
the
man
from
Detroit
.
"
Nate
and
the
Executive
Committee
have
agreed
in
principle
to
phase-out
all
regional
activities
and
bring
the
whole
god-damned
shootin'
match
right
back
here
to
Detroit
,
where
I
always
said
it
should
be
.
"
"
You
got
ta
be
kiddin'
.
"
"
Nope
.
I
'm
deadly
serious
.
I
produced
some
option
plans
and
they
took
to
it
like
a
duck
takes
to
water
.
"
"
What
,
Nate
and
the
Executive
Committee
?
"
"
Yep
.
Well
-
with
a
few
exceptions
.
"
"
You
serious
?
"
"
Course
I
'm
serious
.
"
"
You
amaze
me
.
That
's
a
major
organisational
change
.
Fundamental
policies
.
"
"
Too
damned
right
it
is
.
And
yours
truly
is
in
the
drivin'
seat
.
So
hang
on
for
the
ride
,
Pat
.
It
's
all
systems
go
.
"
"
And
where
do
I
fit
in
under
the
new
organisation
?
"
Muldoon
asked
.
"
Do
I
get
early
retirement
on
full
pension
?
,
"
Sure
do
.
Yes
,
siree
.
Just
what
you
wanted
.
Now
you
can
quit
the
heat
of
the
kitchen
and
swan
around
on
those
yachts
of
yours
you
got
stashed
around
the
world
.
"
"
Yeah
,
guess
you
're
right
.
It
's
got
ta
be
better
than
work
.
"
"
At
your
age
.
You
better
believe
it
.
"
"
What
about
McGillicuddy
?
"
"
He
'll
be
all
right
.
He
'll
be
kicked
upstairs
for
a
year
or
so
before
taking
early
retirement
.
"
"
And
Sanders
?
What
about
him
?
He
's
only
in
his
early
fifties
.
"
"
Yeah
,
well
.
We
ai
n't
gon
na
have
no
limey
runnin'
Europe
from
Detroit
,
that
's
for
sure
.
It
's
got
to
be
an
American
.
You
and
I
are
gon
na
recommend
Klepner
.
He
's
been
doin'
what
he
's
been
told
to
do
,
and
feedin'
me
back
all
the
inside
information
I
need
.
I
can
trust
him
.
He
's
the
kind
of
guy
I
'm
lookin'
for
to
head
up
regional
planning
.
Someone
who
will
carry
out
Detroit
instructions
.
I
do
n't
want
Mister
smart
arse
Sanders
on
my
Detroit
team
.
"
"
Well
,
what
's
gon
na
happen
to
him
?
"
"
Do
n't
know
for
sure
yet
,
but
there
wo
n't
be
any
European
corporate
jobs
left
after
we
centralise
everything
in
Detroit
.
He
can
be
offered
a
divisional
job
in
one
of
the
UK
divisions
I
suppose
.
"
"
Come
off
it
,
Randy
.
He
wo
n't
go
back
to
divisional
work
after
ten
years
at
corporate
level
.
He
could
n't
possibly
accept
such
a
demotion
.
"
"
Well
,
he
ai
n't
comin'
here
to
Detroit
,
that
's
for
sure
.
And
I
can
tell
you
,
buddy
boy
,
that
he
's
Persona
non
grata
with
the
US
vehicle
divisions
after
his
comments
about
the
future
European
trend
toward
smaller
fuel
economy
vehicles
at
the
EPC
meeting
.
"
"
Well
that
's
the
way
things
are
goin'
over
here
,
and
that
's
the
way
he
sees
it
goin'
in
the
future
,
under
the
Government
constraints
he
outlined
at
that
meetin'
.
"
"
Well
all
I
'm
tellin'
you
,
Pat
,
is
that
he
's
made
a
lot
of
enemies
.
Those
guys
do
n't
like
being
questioned
by
Europeans
.
We
run
this
business
-
not
Europeans
.
"
Muldoon
stared
into
space
,
his
face
expressionless
.
"
Hey
Patrick
.
You
still
there
?
"
"
Yeah
,
Randy
,
"
Muldoon
sighed
forlornly
.
"
I
'm
here
.
"
"
I
want
you
to
get
Sanders
out
of
the
country
just
before
next
week
's
EPC
meeting
and
keep
him
out
until
after
the
meetin
's
over
.
I
want
you
to
give
the
European
components
presentation
to
Klepner
.
"
"
What
's
that
?
"
"
No
,
correction
.
I
want
you
to
introduce
the
plan
and
then
hand
over
the
presentation
to
Klepner
.
You
can
introduce
him
as
the
guy
you
and
I
appointed
some
months
back
to
work
with
Sanders
on
the
preparation
of
the
Business
Plan
.
That
way
we
can
see
that
he
gets
the
credit
.
It
will
also
make
it
easier
when
you
and
I
recommend
him
to
take
over
from
Sanders
when
we
pull
it
back
to
Detroit
.
If
Klepner
's
gon
na
get
his
job
he
may
as
well
do
the
spiel
.
We
can
go
easy
on
him
with
the
questions
,
but
I
want
Nate
to
be
impressed
.
Get
it
?
"
"
Yeah
-
I
guess
so
,
Randy
-
if
you
say
so
.
But
I
got
ta
tell
you
that
I
do
n't
like
it
.
It
stinks
.
"
"
Yeah
,
yeah
.
But
before
you
can
make
an
omelette
you
got
ta
break
a
few
eggs
,
ai
n't
that
so
?
"
"
But
the
Business
Plan
is
his
baby
,
Randy
.
He
's
put
that
whole
damn
thing
together
,
almost
single-handed
.
And
it
's
not
gon
na
be
easy
to
get
him
outta
the
country
-
.
He
'll
fight
like
hell
to
present
it
.
I
just
do
n't
like
it
.
"
"
Aw
come
on
,
Pat
.
You
're
making
me
cry
.
OK
,
so
you
lose
some
and
you
win
some
.
Sanders
loses
.
We
ca
n't
all
be
winners
.
Anyway
,
do
n't
you
worry
none
.
You
'll
be
all
right
.
Just
do
what
I
say
,
will
ya
?
There
s
no
point
in
you
tryin
to
swim
against
the
tide
now
,
is
there
?
At
your
age
,
you
'd
drown
!
"
Muldoon
winced
visibly
at
the
younger
man
's
cruel
analogy
.
But
he
was
right
.
There
was
no
point
in
swimming
against
the
tide
.
At
his
age
he
really
would
drown
and
nobody
in
the
Corporation
would
give
a
damn
.
"
Are
you
sure
,
Randy
,
that
Nate
and
the
executive
committee
agree
with
your
proposals
?
"
"
Of
course
I
'm
sure
.
What
the
hell
do
you
think
I
've
been
talkin'
about
the
last
few
minutes
?
Hey
and
listen
,
Pat
,
I
do
n't
want
to
see
or
hear
any
reference
to
that
part
of
the
plan
which
shows
that
we
can
save
up
to
a
billion
dollars
a
year
by
supplying
components
from
the
European
plants
to
fit
US
manufactured
vehicles
.
That
's
not
on
.
The
US
components
divisions
would
hit
the
goddamned
roof
if
that
proposal
was
ever
given
the
light
of
day
.
Is
that
understood
?
"
"
Well
,
I
hear
what
you
're
sayin'
Randy
,
but
I
do
n't
necessarily
agree
with
ya
.
Mark
was
asked
by
McGillicuddy
for
some
ideas
by
which
European
plants
could
reduce
corporate
operating
costs
on
a
world
wide
basis
.
Mark
's
right
.
European
component
manufacturing
costs
are
lower
than
in
the
States
,
and
we
could
save
the
Corporation
around
a
billion
dollars
a
year
by
purchasin'
components
from
our
European
plants
.
So
what
's
wrong
with
puttin'
it
up
for
discussion
?
"
"
Because
the
US
components
divisions
ai
n't
gon
na
like
it
,
that
's
why
!
We
'd
have
a
full
scale
fight
on
our
hands
with
those
guys
if
we
went
ahead
with
that
proposal
!
"
"
Yeah
,
but
hang
on
a
minute
,
Randy
.
Is
n't
that
exactly
what
you
are
proposing
to
do
in
reverse
?
You
and
the
Corporation
have
been
telling
us
to
purchase
from
our
new
subsidiaries
in
Taiwan
,
Korea
,
Singapore
and
even
from
Japan
,
for
God
's
sake
.
Mark
has
told
you
guys
many
times
that
European
Governments
and
European
plant
people
ai
n't
gon
na
like
that
one
little
bit
,
particularly
when
their
own
Far
East
markets
are
heavily
protected
.
So
what
's
different
about
Mark
's
plan
to
sell
components
from
our
European
plants
into
the
United
States
,
if
we
can
save
the
Corporation
a
billion
dollars
a
year
by
doin'
so
?
,
"
Whose
side
are
you
on
,
Pat
?
"
"
The
Corporation
's
,
Randy
.
Whose
side
are
you
on
?
"
"
The
Corporation
's
and
Uncle
Sam
's
.
Are
n't
you
?
"
"
My
responsibilities
are
European
,
so
are
Mark
's
.
If
the
Corporation
wants
to
turn
our
suggestions
down
,
so
be
it
.
But
we
represent
the
interests
of
our
European
plants
,
as
well
as
the
overall
interests
of
the
Corporation
.
How
else
do
we
explain
to
Plant
Managers
and
to
Governments
that
it
's
right
for
the
Corporation
to
purchase
products
from
non-European
sources
,
but
it
's
wrong
to
supply
European
components
to
the
United
States
because
the
US
divisions
would
n't
like
it
?
"
"
Since
when
has
the
interest
of
the
United
States
come
second
,
Pat
?
"
"
Since
when
have
we
had
a
Corporation
plan
which
is
not
truly
multi-national
,
Randy
?
"
"
Since
the
year
dot
,
"
said
the
younger
American
with
finality
.
Muldoon
was
beginning
to
get
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he
was
pushing
his
opinions
too
far
,
something
he
had
never
done
in
his
life
.
He
sensed
the
danger
and
eased
back
.
"
Guess
you
're
right
,
Randy
,
"
he
said
submissively
.
"
Sure
I
'm
right
,
Pat
.
You
know
that
.
Look
,
I
'm
simply
tellin'
ya
to
drop
it
out
of
the
presentation
,
that
's
all
.
The
executive
committee
wo
n't
go
along
with
something
which
does
n't
have
the
support
of
the
US
divisions
.
You
know
that
.
So
why
do
n't
you
do
as
I
say
and
drop
it
?
We
will
amend
the
plan
from
this
end
when
we
pull
it
all
together
.
Just
do
n't
include
it
in
the
presentation
,
that
's
all
.
Sanders
has
already
got
the
US
vehicle
divisions
lined
up
against
him
.
No
point
you
adding
the
component
divisions
as
well
.
Be
smart
.
Do
as
I
say
.
"
"
Yeah
.
I
suppose
you
are
right
,
Randy
.
It
's
a
no-win
situation
.
"
Attaboy
.
Now
you
're
talkin'
.
"
"
But
I
do
n't
like
it
,
Randy
.
It
's
dirty
.
"
"
Yeah
sure
.
But
you
'll
do
it
?
"
"
What
choice
is
there
?
"
"
None
,
I
guess
,
if
you
're
still
interested
in
your
own
future
.
"
"
How
do
I
get
him
out
of
the
country
?
As
I
say
,
he
'll
fight
like
hell
to
give
the
presentation
.
"
Do
n't
worry
.
We
'll
cook
somethin'
up
from
this
end
.
We
got
Government
bastards
crawlin'
all
over
us
out
here
with
their
beggin'
bowls
at
the
ready
.
How
does
he
fancy
Iran
or
Turkey
?
They
are
the
two
latest
to
join
the
beggin'
bowl
line
.
They
'd
love
to
see
him
down
there
.
Lambs
'
eyes
and
bulls
'
bollocks
for
dinner
.
He
'd
just
love
that
.
I
'll
be
in
touch
shortly
to
tell
you
what
we
've
cooked
up
.
Must
go
Pat
.
Nice
talkin'
to
ya
.
Have
a
nice
day
.
"
Muldoon
lowered
the
phone
slowly
,
shaking
his
head
sadly
.
My
God
,
what
was
the
Corporation
coming
to
when
unscrupulous
people
like
Mueller
were
influencing
its
future
and
the
destinies
of
countless
loyal
,
hardworking
and
respected
executives
on
overseas
operations
?
What
in
the
world
would
the
company
be
like
in
a
few
years
'
time
if
such
people
were
in
the
driving
seat
?
Well
the
answer
to
that
question
,
he
supposed
,
was
that
there
would
n't
be
an
overseas
Corporation
to
worry
about
.
What
would
be
the
world
reaction
when
the
full
implications
of
the
new
World
Car
Plan
under
the
new
centralised
organisation
became
more
obvious
?
What
would
be
the
reaction
of
local
managers
,
of
Governments
,
of
the
employees
and
the
unions
?
He
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
all
the
potential
conflict
situations
ahead
.
He
was
glad
he
was
getting
out
.
Mark
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
when
,
two
days
before
the
EPC
meeting
,
Muldoon
told
him
that
Nate
wanted
him
to
fly
out
to
Istanbul
right
away
.
It
was
true
that
a
major
problem
had
just
cropped
up
which
demanded
immediate
attention
.
The
Corporation
's
major
vehicle
assembler
in
Turkey
was
in
serious
difficulties
,
due
to
the
fact
that
the
new
Government
had
slapped
an
embargo
on
the
importation
of
components
to
conserve
its
diminishing
currency
reserves
.
United
Motors
had
received
two
urgent
requests
for
assistance
;
one
from
the
local
Managing
Director
,
who
needed
help
to
resolve
his
serious
plant
problems
,
and
the
other
from
the
Turkish
Prime
Minister
requesting
UM
investment
support
to
reduce
the
country
's
massive
trade
imbalance
.
All
this
was
fact
.
The
fiction
was
that
Nate
had
instructed
Mueller
to
arrange
to
get
Sanders
down
there
quickly
,
when
he
had
done
no
such
thing
.
Muldoon
spun
the
line
that
the
deteriorating
situation
in
Turkey
was
clearly
more
important
right
now
than
the
EPC
meeting
.
Events
there
were
taking
much
the
same
course
as
they
had
in
Portugal
,
and
as
Mark
had
resolved
that
problem
in
double
quick
time
,
he
was
considered
the
best
man
to
deal
with
this
new
problem
situation
.
All
very
flattering
,
but
-
.
The
Englishman
sensed
that
the
big
personal
build-up
was
a
blind
to
hide
Muldoon
's
real
reason
for
wanting
him
out
of
the
country
.
He
knew
full
well
that
the
only
circumstances
in
which
a
regional
planning
manager
would
not
be
expected
personally
to
present
his
Ten
Year
Business
Plan
to
the
President
of
the
Corporation
was
if
he
was
already
earmarked
for
promotion
and
it
was
desired
to
give
visibility
to
his
successor
,
or
if
he
was
on
his
way
out
.
Mark
knew
that
he
would
never
be
promoted
after
the
Steiner
incident
so
he
concluded
he
must
indeed
be
on
his
way
out
,
or
being
moved
sideways
.
Sensing
the
game
which
was
being
played
,
he
decided
to
throw
several
balls
in
the
air
for
Muldoon
to
catch
,
if
he
could
.
So
he
said
that
he
would
take
the
next
available
flight
to
Turkey
immediately
after
the
EPC
meeting
.
No
,
that
was
no
good
.
Istanbul
was
expecting
him
.
Meetings
had
been
set
up
.
Nate
wanted
him
there
straight
away
;
like
today
;
tomorrow
at
the
latest
.
"
Well
,
give
me
a
few
minutes
,
"
Mark
said
,
"
and
I
'll
ring
the
Prime
Minister
's
office
in
Istanbul
,
to
see
if
they
'll
agree
to
a
short
postponement
.
"
"
No
,
you
ca
n't
do
that
,
"
Muldoon
replied
hurriedly
.
"
It
was
Nate
himself
who
had
the
meetings
fixed
up
,
and
he
would
n't
want
them
changed
.
"
"
But
nothing
can
be
more
important
than
the
Business
Plan
,
"
Mark
insisted
.
"
Nothing
,
but
nothing
,
is
ever
allowed
to
take
precedence
over
that
meeting
.
Dammit
,
it
's
the
future
of
the
European
components
business
I
'll
be
talking
about
.
"
"
Yes
,
I
know
that
,
Mark
,
"
the
American
countered
.
"
But
Nate
has
specifically
said
that
you
are
the
man
he
wants
to
fly
out
to
Turkey
.
I
'll
have
to
give
the
presentation
on
your
behalf
.
After
all
,
I
am
the
Regional
Manager
.
"
"
But
you
never
give
the
planning
presentations
.
That
s
my
bailiwick
,
"
countered
the
Englishman
,
with
growing
resentment
in
his
voice
and
manner
.
"
Yes
,
I
know
that
,
Mark
,
but
-
.
"
The
American
could
n't
continue
the
charade
any
longer
.
Lowering
his
head
,
he
said
,
"
I
'm
sorry
,
Mark
,
but
that
's
the
way
they
want
it
,
and
that
's
the
way
it
's
got
to
be
.
Klepner
can
check
out
the
slides
for
me
.
They
are
all
done
,
are
n't
they
,
and
the
text
?
"
Mark
nodded
his
head
.
"
Yes
,
sure
.
Everything
's
finished
.
"
He
only
realised
the
finality
of
the
phrase
a
second
or
so
later
.
Muldoon
did
n't
know
quite
what
to
say
.
"
I
know
you
have
worked
your
arse
off
to
produce
the
plan
,
Mark
,
and
it
's
a
great
one
.
No
doubt
about
that
.
But
if
Detroit
has
its
reasons
,
it
has
its
reasons
.
It
's
as
simple
as
that
.
I
'll
hold
the
fort
and
fill
you
in
when
you
get
back
.
"
Mark
turned
towards
the
door
.
It
was
pointless
to
argue
further
.
Muldoon
was
simply
carrying
out
instructions
.
"
Fill
me
in
-
that
's
just
about
it
,
Pat
,
nice
choice
of
words
.
"
He
opened
the
door
and
turned
toward
the
American
.
Who
are
you
going
to
hand
the
presentation
over
to
,
after
you
have
given
the
introduction
?
"
he
asked
quietly
.
They
both
said
the
name
together
-
"
Klepner
.
"
Mark
was
sick
at
heart
as
he
drove
home
that
evening
.
He
had
a
blinding
headache
and
simply
was
n't
thinking
of
what
he
was
doing
as
he
swung
the
car
off
the
slip
road
to
enter
the
motorway
.
His
thoughts
were
fiercely
occupied
elsewhere
.
Without
even
glancing
in
the
mirror
,
he
crossed
the
inner
and
middle
lanes
into
the
fast
lane
and
,
in
fewer
than
ten
seconds
the
speedometer
needle
was
registering
one
hundred
and
fifteen
miles
an
hour
,
but
Mark
was
oblivious
of
the
fact
.
Suddenly
conscious
that
he
was
flashing
past
vehicles
which
appeared
to
be
dawdling
,
he
glanced
at
the
speedometer
.
He
was
doing
one
hundred
and
twenty
!
He
jerked
his
foot
off
the
accelerator
and
glanced
in
the
mirror
,
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
that
nobody
was
on
his
tail
.
Slowing
to
seventy
,
he
made
his
way
home
.
He
very
rarely
spoke
about
business
matters
to
Georgina
and
decided
on
reflection
against
recounting
the
day
's
events
except
to
say
that
he
was
leaving
for
Istanbul
in
the
morning
,
and
would
be
away
for
three
or
four
days
.
The
Tri-star
jet
was
two
hours
late
on
take-off
from
Heathrow
,
and
then
had
to
abort
on
the
runway
at
lift-off
point
due
to
a
sudden
failure
of
one
of
the
engines
.
The
pilot
slammed
the
powerful
jets
into
reverse
thrust
,
bringing
the
giant
plane
to
a
halt
just
before
he
ran
out
of
runway
.
In
a
very
matter-of-fact
voice
he
apologised
for
the
shut
down
,
due
to
engine
failure
,
adding
laconically
that
he
had
left
ten
thousand
pounds
worth
of
tyres
on
the
runway
.
"
British
Airways
will
not
be
at
all
pleased
with
me.
"
he
remarked
casually
.
"
There
goes
another
Brownie
point
.
"
By
the
time
the
plane
approached
Istanbul
in
the
late
afternoon
,
Mark
had
put
away
several
large
measures
of
single
malt
Scotch
.
Mechanically
he
had
taken
each
drink
offered
without
thinking
,
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
had
spent
the
entire
journey
staring
out
of
the
cabin
window
into
the
infinity
of
space
.
His
meeting
was
not
until
the
next
morning
,
so
he
could
switch
off
for
a
few
hours
.
He
needed
to
do
just
that
,
for
he
was
tired
,
morose
and
bitter
and
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
feeling
very
insecure
.
Gazing
out
into
the
blue
,
he
asked
himself
if
this
assignment
was
his
swan
song
.
Must
be
,
he
concluded
.
Nate
would
never
have
taken
him
off
the
presentation
if
he
was
n't
being
moved
sideways
or
demoted
.
But
why
?
To
make
way
for
Klepner
,
Mueller
's
pet
poodle
?
It
had
happened
before
,
to
make
way
for
Muldoon
.
Why
should
n't
it
happen
again
?
If
you
could
n't
trust
the
bastards
then
,
why
should
you
trust
them
now
?
He
closed
his
eyes
.
What
made
Nate
and
the
executive
committee
think
that
guys
like
Klepner
and
Mueller
knew
more
about
the
European
components
"
business
than
the
Europeans
?
What
the
hell
would
the
US
component
divisions
say
if
the
executive
committee
was
stupid
enough
to
appoint
Europeans
to
manage
components
operations
in
the
United
States
?
No
prizes
for
guessing
the
answer
to
that
question
.
The
blonde
hostess
leaned
across
him
to
re-charge
his
glass
for
the
umpteenth
time
.
His
favourite
Scotch
,
Glenlivet
.
Good
old
George
and
James
Smith
.
Now
there
were
two
characters
you
could
trust
!
So
easy
to
relax
and
forget
your
troubles
when
you
had
a
glass
of
their
malt
in
your
hand
-
.
He
jerked
forward
with
a
start
to
find
the
hostess
fingering
with
his
seat-belt
clasp
.
"
Just
arriving
at
Istanbul
sir
.
Please
fasten
your
seat
belt
.
"
Fred
Clasper
,
the
militant
Merseyside
convener
,
was
a
desperately
worried
man
.
Things
were
n't
going
at
all
well
within
the
UK
vehicle
Division
.
Even
his
own
notorious
plant
,
which
had
consistently
gone
downhill
for
ten
years
under
his
active
leadership
,
had
been
steadily
increasing
efficiency
and
output
for
several
weeks
without
interruption
.
Morale
on
the
shop
floor
was
higher
than
it
had
been
for
a
long
year
and
an
unhealthy
atmosphere
of
optimism
and
hope
pervaded
the
plant
.
Union
members
were
openly
expressing
the
view
that
there
was
a
real
chance
that
the
ailing
division
would
now
pull
out
of
its
dive
with
the
Peters
'
Plan
,
which
had
been
fully
supported
by
Bunker
and
a
two-thirds
majority
at
the
plant
.
To
Clasper
's
disgust
,
the
majority
had
voted
against
his
recommended
call
for
strike
action
and
he
now
sensed
all
too
painfully
that
he
was
beginning
to
lose
control
of
his
members
.
Management
was
once
again
managing
,
something
which
he
had
never
allowed
to
happen
during
his
ten
years
as
convener
.
Arising
from
Clem
Bunker
's
endorsement
of
the
plan
,
new
methods
had
been
introduced
which
were
greatly
increasing
earnings
through
higher
productivity
.
Restrictive
practices
,
which
Clasper
had
fought
so
hard
to
introduce
,
were
being
discarded
at
a
rate
of
knots
in
the
quest
to
increase
efficiency
,
output
and
earnings
.
As
a
lifelong
Communist
,
Clasper
knew
that
it
was
absolutely
essential
to
wrest
control
of
the
workers
away
from
the
plant
management
.
He
had
exercised
effective
control
of
the
labour
force
for
ten
years
at
the
giant
plant
and
had
been
able
to
bring
the
workers
out
on
strike
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
.
It
was
he
,
Clasper
,
who
dictated
to
management
the
size
of
the
labour
force
they
would
require
to
produce
a
given
number
of
products
,
regardless
of
any
figure
which
management
might
arrive
at
by
employing
accurately
measured
work
standards
.
If
in
effect
,
Clasper
said
that
three
men
must
be
employed
to
do
two
men
's
work
,
then
that
was
it
.
On
those
occasions
when
he
had
felt
the
need
to
demonstrate
his
power
to
management
,
he
would
create
an
instant
departmental
dispute
which
always
had
the
immediate
effect
of
lowering
that
day
's
efficiency
to
below
fifty
per
cent
.
Since
the
plant
manager
was
never
able
to
make
up
a
day
's
loss
of
output
which
pulled
down
his
monthly
overall
efficiency
figures
on
which
he
was
judged
,
it
was
never
difficult
for
Clasper
to
prove
his
point
.
As
he
had
always
succeeded
in
getting
his
own
way
,
the
workers
had
been
inclined
to
go
along
with
him
,
even
when
their
instincts
told
them
that
he
was
wrong
.
They
really
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
for
he
had
always
been
able
to
threaten
any
dissenters
,
or
strays
,
with
the
loss
of
their
union
cards
.
Successive
personnel
managers
had
always
caved
in
to
his
demands
as
they
knew
full
well
that
Clasper
would
win
a
stand-up
fight
.
Yet
an
uneasy
feeling
had
been
steadily
growing
among
the
ten
thousand
workers
employed
at
the
plant
that
the
benefits
which
Clasper
's
militancy
had
achieved
were
illusory
.
Increased
earnings
,
grabbed
as
a
result
of
strike
action
rather
than
earned
by
increased
productivity
and
profitability
had
always
been
subsequently
eaten
away
by
inflation
.
The
Corporation
was
also
no
longer
expanding
its
British
operations
,
in
marked
contrast
to
the
frequent
expansion
of
its
plants
in
Germany
,
Belgium
and
France
.
Every
long
service
worker
employed
at
the
plant
and
within
the
division
knew
that
union
restrictive
practices
had
lowered
productivity
to
below
the
levels
achieved
on
the
continent
.
These
more
loyal
long
service
employees
had
an
intuitive
feeling
that
the
division
would
ultimately
go
out
of
business
in
the
UK
if
it
continued
to
operate
in
the
way
it
had
behaved
over
the
previous
ten
years
.
Even
the
notoriously
militant
workers
at
the
Merseyside
plant
were
now
beginning
to
recognise
that
distinct
possibility
.
It
was
generally
recognised
that
Clasper
was
not
the
man
to
dismantle
restrictive
practices
,
nor
to
co-operate
with
management
to
make
the
necessary
improvements
in
labour
relations
if
they
were
to
keep
their
jobs
in
future
.
The
majority
now
believed
that
Bunker
's
more
realistic
approach
made
more
sense
.
Clasper
was
beginning
to
be
seen
by
his
own
members
for
what
he
really
was
:
a
born
agitator
and
troublemaker
who
was
great
to
have
around
when
plant
managements
behaved
like
bastards
because
he
was
one
too
and
would
give
as
good
as
he
got
in
a
stand-up
fight
.
But
he
certainly
was
n't
the
man
to
have
in
the
driving
seat
on
the
union
side
when
both
management
and
workers
were
striving
for
the
sheer
survival
of
the
company
,
and
needed
to
work
together
if
they
were
to
pull
through
.
It
was
being
said
quite
openly
on
the
factory
floor
that
the
only
place
Clasper
would
lead
them
to
was
the
end
of
the
dole
queue
.
The
Communist
convener
could
both
feel
and
see
that
he
was
losing
control
.
Fewer
workers
bothered
to
listen
to
him
when
he
called
meetings
to
protest
against
the
Peters
'
Plan
.
He
was
also
being
subjected
to
cat-calls
and
ridicule
.
At
one
such
meeting
a
heckler
had
got
a
great
round
of
cheers
from
the
assembled
throng
when
he
had
told
Clasper
to
get
off
his
bloody
soap-box
and
do
a
day
's
work
for
a
bloody
change
.
To
his
disgust
he
found
that
the
workers
would
no
longer
respond
to
his
call
for
mass
meetings
during
working
hours
.
They
now
told
him
,
in
no
uncertain
terms
,
that
if
he
had
something
important
to
communicate
,
he
could
do
it
in
the
plant
car
park
during
the
lunch
break
,
or
after
working
hours
.
They
were
not
disposed
to
lose
both
output
and
earnings
by
downing
tools
.
In
desperation
Clasper
called
a
private
meeting
of
the
hard
core
left-wing
stewards
under
his
convenership
,
who
could
always
be
relied
upon
to
fight
against
management
and
the
capitalist
system
.
The
British
people
had
just
elected
a
Conservative
Government
,
headed
by
Britain
's
first
ever
woman
Prime
Minister
,
who
had
already
earned
the
reputation
of
being
"
the
best
man
for
the
job
"
in
the
Conservative
Party
.
Within
days
of
taking
office
,
she
had
invited
Don
Peters
to
explain
the
problems
which
had
bedevilled
the
British
vehicle
plants
during
the
sixties
and
seventies
and
to
outline
his
company
's
plan
for
the
future
.
Living
up
to
her
reputation
,
Peters
found
that
she
had
done
her
homework
thoroughly
.
She
was
tough
and
uncompromising
.
She
noted
,
she
said
with
a
pained
expression
,
that
output
from
the
UK
Vehicle
Division
of
United
Motors
had
been
falling
steadily
over
the
previous
ten
years
.
At
the
same
time
,
UM
imports
had
been
steadily
rising
,
including
very
substantial
imports
from
UM
Vehicle
Divisions
on
the
Continent
which
had
greatly
expanded
their
total
output
and
exports
over
the
same
period
.
"
United
Motors
used
to
make
a
very
healthy
contribution
to
Britain
's
export
drive
.
Now
you
are
the
biggest
single
contributor
to
our
balance
of
payments
deficit
,
"
she
said
acidly
.
"
Trends
of
this
nature
do
n't
simply
happen
,
do
they
?
"
she
asked
with
feigned
innocence
.
"
It
has
to
be
planned
that
way
,
does
it
not
?
"
She
wanted
to
know
what
the
UK
Vehicle
Division
was
doing
to
correct
its
appalling
track
record
of
recent
years
,
particularly
when
compared
with
its
Continental
plants
.
She
then
ticked
off
several
points
she
wished
to
make
.
Don
Peters
had
been
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
the
Prime
Minister
's
forthright
manner
lived
up
to
her
advance
publicity
.
The
United
Kingdom
had
a
serious
balance
of
payments
problem
in
manufactured
goods
,
which
was
only
partly
disguised
by
the
revenue
beginning
to
flood
in
from
North
Sea
oil
,
which
had
a
limited
life
.
The
problem
had
been
seriously
aggravated
by
the
poor
performances
of
UK
vehicle
producers
-
his
own
company
foremost
among
them
-
and
the
Prime
Minister
naturally
wanted
to
know
what
he
was
doing
to
correct
the
adverse
trend
.
It
was
a
straightforward
and
most
pertinent
question
.
He
would
have
posed
the
same
question
if
he
had
been
sitting
in
her
position
.
For
nearly
half
an
hour
,
the
American
explained
the
plan
which
the
Corporation
had
recently
approved
.
He
then
answered
the
many
penetrating
questions
put
to
him
.
In
answer
to
one
such
question
,
he
replied
that
he
was
pleased
to
say
that
he
was
now
being
given
full
support
by
the
unions
which
drew
the
sharp
retort
-
.
"
NOT
BEFORE
TIME
!
"
Before
she
dismissed
him
she
said
unequivocally
that
it
was
the
Government
's
intention
to
rebuild
Britain
's
weakened
manufacturing
base
and
reduce
the
ever-growing
importation
of
manufactured
products
.
"
If
industry
does
n't
help
me
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
Government
,
we
will
have
to
take
appropriate
alternative
steps
,
"
she
had
said
with
a
steely
smile
.
"
But
I
hope
that
wo
n't
be
necessary
.
Thank
you
so
much
,
Mr
Peters
for
the
chat
.
Most
helpful
.
I
will
invite
you
to
dinner
when
you
correct
your
trade
imbalance
.
"
Mark
booked
into
The
Istanbul
Hilton
in
the
mid-evening
and
,
after
a
shower
,
returned
to
the
lobby
where
he
purchased
a
thriller
before
retiring
to
the
comfort
of
an
easy
chair
in
the
lounge
.
He
continued
to
drink
quietly
for
another
hour
before
going
in
to
dinner
.
Afterwards
he
adjourned
to
the
cocktail
bar
for
a
nightcap
.
He
was
now
feeling
pleasantly
intoxicated
from
the
effects
of
a
steady
supply
of
alcohol
,
which
had
lifted
his
flagging
spirits
.
He
was
now
more
at
peace
with
the
world
of
United
Motors
.
Sipping
a
large
Armagnac
and
enjoying
the
heady
aroma
of
a
Havana
cigar
,
he
had
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
life
could
,
and
would
go
on
.
Whatever
lay
ahead
,
maybe
it
was
for
the
best
.
All
is
for
the
best
in
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
,
he
mused
,
blowing
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
air
above
him
.
That
's
what
Voltaire
's
Pangloss
had
said
,
was
n't
it
?
And
just
look
at
the
problems
which
had
faced
poor
Candide
.
Maybe
it
was
time
for
a
change
,
anyway
.
Thirty
years
was
a
long
time
to
stay
with
one
company
.
Should
have
got
out
after
the
Steiner
incident
.
Fool
not
to
have
done
so
.
Early
fifties
is
leaving
it
a
bit
late
.
Over
fifty
policy
comes
into
effect
.
Fate
perhaps
.
Do
I
believe
in
Fate
?
Really
do
n't
know
.
"
There
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
man
,
which
taken
at
the
flood
,
leads
on
to
-
"
heaven
knows
what
and
where
.
A
voluptuous
blonde
hooker
in
a
long
white
gown
entered
the
spacious
bar
.
The
front
was
slashed
all
the
way
down
to
her
navel
to
reveal
rounded
breasts
,
which
rose
and
fell
temptingly
like
a
couple
of
ripe
peaches
.
Just
inside
the
entrance
,
she
turned
to
survey
the
clientele
,
making
sure
as
she
did
so
that
all
the
men
got
a
tantalising
glimpse
of
a
very
long
and
elegant
leg
exposed
through
a
side
slit
.
The
bar
was
fairly
full
,
with
groups
of
local
worthies
and
their
wives
and
a
clutch
of
broody
businessmen
.
From
the
attention
which
focused
on
her
,
it
was
obvious
that
the
blonde
would
make
a
sale
in
no
time
at
all
.
Eyes
turned
as
she
walked
slowly
across
the
room
,
brushing
by
this
man
and
that
.
To
his
surprise
,
she
stopped
when
she
reached
Mark
's
chair
and
took
the
vacant
seat
beside
him
,
nodding
casually
in
his
direction
and
flashing
a
devastating
smile
as
she
carefully
arranged
herself
on
display
.
She
crossed
her
slender
legs
very
slowly
so
that
the
panel
of
her
dress
fell
away
to
reveal
long
,
shapely
limbs
plus
a
glimpse
of
white
satin
briefs
.
Mark
smiled
the
appreciative
smile
of
a
man
who
was
just
looking
,
not
buying
.
Must
be
too
expensive
for
the
locals
,
he
mused
.
Perhaps
the
fiddle
sheet
did
n't
run
to
outside
entertainment
more
than
once
a
month
.
Soaring
inflation
,
perhaps
.
Up
sixty
per
cent
this
year
in
Turkey
,
he
'd
read
in
The
Financial
Times
.
No
-
wait
a
minute
.
Devaluation
of
the
Turkish
lira
.
Down
forty
per
cent
.
That
's
it
!
She
's
after
the
export
business
.
She
gives
a
much
better
exchange
rate
and
gets
forty
per
cent
more
lira
for
every
pound
,
deutschmark
or
dollar
she
takes
.
Not
bad
,
eh
,
when
you
're
giving
your
all
for
your
country
?
She
smiled
again
,
which
Mark
again
returned
,
even
though
he
was
not
in
the
running
.
Just
an
interested
bystander
,
studying
the
form
in
the
paddock
and
placing
bets
on
who
would
be
the
jockey
who
would
saddle
her
up
.
Chap
at
the
far
end
of
the
bar
in
a
grey
pin-stripe
clearly
fancied
his
chances
.
Been
ogling
her
up
and
down
ever
since
she
'd
entered
the
room
.
Down
boy
,
down
!
She
's
too
expensive
for
you
,
even
after
allowing
for
devaluation
.
Where
on
earth
were
the
Germans
?
They
could
afford
her
.
God
only
knows
how
many
lira
there
were
to
the
deutschmark
these
days
.
Must
be
bloody
millions
.
He
watched
her
fumble
for
an
intentionally
long
time
in
her
handbag
for
the
means
of
lighting
the
Turkish
cigarette
she
held
aloft
in
her
left
hand
,
only
a
foot
or
so
away
from
Mark
's
head
.
He
was
an
ungallant
swine
for
deliberately
not
coming
to
her
aid
,
but
in
truth
he
really
wanted
to
see
which
of
the
likely
lads
,
would
dash
forward
.
Surprisingly
,
there
were
no
punters
.
At
long
last
she
looked
up
imploringly
from
the
depths
of
her
tiny
handbag
,
which
prompted
Mark
to
produce
his
lighter
.
Thank
you
,
"
she
said
,
blowing
a
thin
wisp
of
smoke
in
the
air
.
"
I
thought
you
'd
never
respond
.
Are
you
waiting
for
someone
?
,
Her
voice
was
cultured
and
unmistakably
English
.
"
No
,
not
really
,
"
he
replied
.
"
Just
enjoying
the
parade
in
the
paddock
,
"
he
added
casually
.
"
So
you
ARE
English
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
thought
so
.
Always
give
yourselves
away
,
you
chaps
.
"
"
Is
that
so
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Do
tell
me
,
and
what
gives
a
destitute
Englishman
away
in
a
foreign
land
?
Decadence
?
"
"
Style
,
"
she
replied
,
throwing
her
long
fair
hair
over
her
shoulders
and
flashing
him
the
toothpaste
smile
again
.
"
Style
?
"
"
Style
.
"
He
raised
his
eyebrows
in
surprise
and
softly
sang
the
words
of
the
song
.
"
So
you
've
got
,
or
you
have
n't
got
-
style
.
"
She
finished
the
next
line
,
"
If
you
've
got
it
,
it
stands
out
-
a
mile
.
"
They
laughed
together
.
"
Sanders
.
Mark
Sanders
,
"
he
said
,
introducing
himself
.
"
Will
you
have
a
drink
?
"
"
Love
one
.
White
lady
,
"
she
replied
.
"
Destitute
Englishman
,
"
she
scoffed
dismissively
.
"
My
eye
.
With
those
shoes
?
British
and
Harrods
to
the
last
.
Name
's
Virginia
,
believe
it
or
not
.
But
my
friends
call
me
Ginny
.
More
appropriate
.
"
"
So
that
's
what
gave
me
away
.
My
shoes
.
Well
,
bless
my
soul
,
"
he
said
,
with
an
air
of
exaggerated
surprise
.
"
They
have
n't
got
holes
in
have
they
?
"
he
asked
in
mock
horror
,
glancing
at
the
sole
.
"
I
wondered
why
you
sat
next
to
me
,
when
you
obviously
had
the
field
to
play
.
Why
pick
on
me
?
"
"
I
've
told
you
.
Style
.
"
she
replied
,
with
her
winning
smile
.
"
And
yes
,
I
do
like
the
company
of
my
compatriots
.
Miss
home
quite
a
lot
.
Daddy
fell
from
grace
,
poor
dear
.
Lost
everything
,
so
I
came
out
here
.
Well
,
a
girl
's
got
to
live
,
has
n't
she
?
"
She
added
brightly
,
"
Much
easier
to
be
a
fallen
woman
when
you
're
miles
from
home
.
Must
keep
up
the
family
tradition
you
know
.
Daddy
always
did
say
to
do
what
you
do
best
,
and
I
am
very
good
at
it
-
so
they
say
.
"
"
Are
you
now
-
?
"
he
replied
.
"
Excellent
references
.
"
She
took
the
cocktail
which
the
waiter
had
just
brought
.
"
Cheers
,
"
she
said
,
raising
her
glass
to
him
.
"
Happy
nights
to
happy
days
.
"
"
Bottoms
up
,
"
Mark
said
,
raising
his
glass
in
return
.
"
Of
course
.
Bottoms
up
.
Now
that
's
an
English
expression
I
have
n't
heard
in
a
long
time
.
Must
use
it
in
the
future
.
Very
English
and
most
apt
.
"
Mark
glanced
round
the
room
.
"
Look
,
sweetheart
,
must
n't
keep
you
away
from
the
punters
.
By
the
looks
of
'em
,
they
are
all
champing
at
the
bit
to
place
their
bets
.
And
you
are
the
hot
favourite
,
bonny
lass
.
No
doubt
about
that
.
The
others
have
n't
a
look
in
.
Not
in
your
class
.
"
"
Are
n't
you
a
gambling
man
?
"
she
asked
provocatively
.
"
No
,
not
me
.
Not
any
more
.
With
my
luck
,
Ginny
,
I
'd
lose
if
I
backed
the
only
filly
in
a
one
horse
race
,
"
Mark
told
her
,
suddenly
conscious
of
the
fact
that
his
speech
was
beginning
to
slur
.
"
You
could
n't
lose
with
me
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
'd
give
you
a
very
good
run
for
your
money
.
"
"
I
bet
you
would
.
But
it
's
not
your
performance
I
'm
worried
about
,
sweetheart
.
It
's
mine
.
"
"
Never
lost
a
rider
yet
"
"
Always
a
first
time
,
"
he
said
.
"
Bit
out
of
practice
,
"
They
laughed
together
at
the
sexy
banter
.
"
I
like
you
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
like
men
who
make
me
laugh
.
Especially
in
bed
.
I
give
encores
,
you
know
,
when
I
'm
happy
.
"
"
At
no
extra
charge
?
"
"
No
extra
charge
.
"
"
Bully
for
you
,
"
said
Mark
approvingly
.
"
Always
satisfy
the
customer
if
you
are
looking
for
repeat
business
.
Reminds
me
of
a
piece
of
graffiti
outside
Saint
Martin-in
the-Fields
.
The
poster
said
:
"
All
ye
who
have
sinned
,
enter
here
"
and
a
bright
girl
had
written
underneath
:
"
All
ye
who
have
not
sinned
,
ring
Maida
Vale
123456
"
.
"
"
Must
remember
that
,
"
she
laughed
.
"
Free
advertising
.
"
"
Smart
girl
.
You
'll
go
far
.
"
"
How
far
do
you
want
me
to
go
?
"
"
I
'm
not
sure
I
'm
physically
in
good
enough
shape
to
take
the
excitement
of
the
ride
,
"
he
said
,
raising
his
glass
to
her
.
"
Maybe
you
ought
to
find
yourself
a
younger
jockey
.
"
"
Nonsense
.
You
look
in
good
shape
to
me
,
and
anyway
,
I
prefer
more
mature
riders
.
They
pace
the
race
so
much
better
.
"
"
Ah
,
the
filly
who
prefers
the
leisurely
canter
to
the
short-lived
gallop
,
"
he
said
appreciatively
.
"
How
eminently
considerate
.
So
what
odds
do
you
lay
me
finishing
the
course
on
the
bookie
's
favourite
?
"
"
Fifty
,
"
she
said
promptly
.
"
Fifty
to
win
is
a
lot
of
money
to
lay
out
on
an
untried
filly
.
"
"
Not
this
one
,
I
promise
you
.
"
"
Dollars
,
or
pounds
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Pounds
of
course
.
What
do
you
take
me
for
?
"
she
asked
in
mock
surprise
.
"
My
dear
Ginny
,
that
's
not
in
question
.
We
've
already
established
what
you
are
.
We
are
simply
negotiating
the
price
-
!
As
I
think
George
Bernard
Shaw
once
said
.
"
"
You
beast
.
Hardly
the
way
to
win
friends
and
influence
people
,
"
she
replied
,
pouting
prettily
.
"
You
can
soon
go
off
someone
,
you
know
.
"
"
Sorry
.
My
mistake
.
Mosht
ungallant
.
"
He
blinked
and
shook
his
head
to
bring
the
room
back
into
focus
.
His
speech
really
was
slurred
now
.
"
So
let's
have
a
stirrup
cup
before
that
happens
.
"
He
signalled
the
waiter
.
"
Great
idea
.
"
she
said
.
"
Bottoms
up
!
"
A
few
minutes
later
,
feeling
decidedly
the
worse
for
wear
after
the
last
Armagnac
had
been
downed
,
Mark
moved
unsteadily
into
the
lift
with
his
voluptuous
mate
.
As
they
entered
his
room
,
she
reversed
against
the
door
,
closing
it
with
her
bottom
.
Draping
her
arms
over
his
shoulders
,
she
cradled
his
head
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
,
pulling
him
toward
her
to
close
a
hungry
,
wet
open
mouth
on
his
.
Restlessly
exploring
with
an
eager
tongue
,
she
eased
his
jacket
from
his
shoulders
.
It
fell
noiselessly
to
the
thick
carpeted
floor
.
He
tugged
at
the
zip
on
the
back
of
her
dress
while
she
unbuttoned
his
shirt
and
removed
his
tie
.
She
let
the
dress
fall
,
pushing
him
away
gently
to
slip
out
of
tiny
white
satin
briefs
.
She
was
naked
as
she
drew
him
towards
her
.
Her
hands
slid
under
his
shirt
,
unbuckling
,
unzipping
,
thrusting
on
downwards
.
She
kissed
him
again
on
the
lips
before
mouth
followed
the
path
her
hands
were
taking
.
"
Do
you
like
me
?
"
she
whispered
.
"
Ask
a
silly
question
,
"
he
gasped
.
"
Fantastic
!
"
And
then
,
suddenly
,
without
warning
,
a
bomb-burst
of
excruciating
pain
exploded
inside
his
skull
and
sent
him
reeling
.
Head
clasped
in
hands
,
he
sprawled
on
the
bed
,
gasping
for
air
,
as
the
room
swayed
crazily
from
side
to
side
.
It
was
sheer
hell
.
Frightened
by
what
had
happened
,
the
girl
bent
nervously
over
him
.
"
Are
you
all
right
?
"
she
asked
tremulously
,
taking
care
not
to
touch
him
.
He
struggled
breathlessly
to
find
the
words
.
"
Yes
-
be
all
right
-
terrible
pain
-
give
me
a
few
minutes
-
be
OK
.
"
She
looked
at
the
crumpled
figure
who
was
fighting
for
breath
on
the
pillow
,
perspiration
pouring
down
his
anguished
face
.
"
Shall
I
get
you
a
drink
?
"
she
asked
.
He
nodded
.
"
Scotch
-
on
table
.
"
"
Cigarette
?
"
she
asked
.
"
No
.
"
She
poured
two
glasses
and
gave
him
one
.
In
the
semi-darkness
Mark
could
see
her
movements
.
She
had
a
most
beautiful
body
which
looked
opalescent
in
the
half
light
.
He
took
a
gulp
at
the
Scotch
and
gave
a
wry
smile
at
the
injustices
of
this
world
which
caused
him
to
be
smitten
with
another
one
of
those
blinding
attacks
just
when
he
was
about
to
make
it
.
Well
,
they
always
said
it
was
the
only
way
to
go
and
he
believed
it
.
He
was
perspiring
heavily
as
he
sipped
his
drink
,
gazing
wistfully
at
the
voluptuous
creature
who
stood
naked
before
him
in
the
half
light
with
a
look
of
scared
concern
on
her
young
face
.
"
Shall
I
get
a
doctor
?
"
she
asked
,
at
length
.
"
No
.
I
'll
be
OK
.
"
"
Are
you
sure
?
"
"
Sure
.
Feeling
a
lot
better
already
.
Thanks
.
"
He
moved
himself
into
a
reclining
position
,
head
against
the
padded
headrest
.
The
room
started
to
sway
again
and
the
pains
in
his
head
intensified
.
"
Told
you
I
was
too
old
a
jockey
,
"
he
joked
.
"
Fell
at
the
first
fence
.
"
He
was
about
to
say
"
game
to
the
last
"
but
thought
again
.
She
smiled
at
his
efforts
to
be
funny
.
"
I
was
looking
forward
to
the
ride
.
Frustrated
filly
.
Entered
then
scratched
.
What
a
palaver
.
"
"
Have
to
be
a
stewards
"
enquiry
,
"
he
said
painfully
.
"
Lot
of
money
went
on
the
favourite
.
"
"
Under
starter
's
orders
,
so
I
'm
afraid
no
stake
money
refunded
.
"
"
Of
course
,
"
he
said
.
"
Jockey
to
blame
.
"
She
walked
to
the
bathroom
and
returned
with
a
towel
to
mop
his
sweating
face
.
"
That
feels
good
.
Thanks
,
"
he
said
.
She
sat
on
the
bed
,
mopping
his
brow
.
He
closed
his
eyes
.
Not
a
bad
looking
devil
,
she
thought
.
More
than
just
a
few
grey
hairs
here
and
there
.
Plenty
of
lines
on
his
face
,
which
she
had
n't
really
noticed
before
,
but
which
were
particularly
noticeable
now
.
No
matter
.
They
gave
him
character
and
sex
appeal
.
About
fifty
,
she
thought
.
Why
was
it
that
she
always
found
herself
attracted
to
older
men
?
More
interesting
,
she
supposed
.
She
liked
a
man
with
a
sense
of
humour
.
Had
a
good
figure
.
quite
looked
forward
to
his
love-making
.
Pity
.
She
continued
to
pat
his
face
with
the
towel
.
Wonder
who
he
is
?
she
thought
.
International
business
man
,
that
's
for
sure
.
Written
all
over
him
.
Married
.
No
doubt
.
They
all
were
.
Wife
who
loves
him
,
but
who
has
gone
off
sex
.
How
often
had
they
said
that
.
No
ring
on
his
hand
,
but
that
was
nothing
to
go
by
.
Very
few
married
men
wore
rings
these
days
.
Ca
n't
blame
them
.
Better
chance
to
play
the
field
.
He
was
breathing
less
heavily
now
.
Perhaps
he
was
asleep
.
She
dabbed
his
forehead
.
"
Are
you
asleep
?
"
she
whispered
.
"
No
,
"
he
whispered
back
.
He
wanted
to
say
:
"
With
a
girl
like
you
in
the
room
?
"
but
was
too
exhausted
to
make
the
effort
.
She
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
lips
and
rose
from
the
bed
to
get
dressed
.
Taking
his
jacket
from
the
floor
she
opened
his
wallet
and
took
out
two
twenties
and
a
ten
before
returning
the
wallet
to
the
inside
pocket
.
Putting
the
money
in
her
bag
she
checked
her
face
in
the
mirror
and
walked
back
to
the
bed
.
Are
you
asleep
now
?
"
she
whispered
.
"
Yes
,
"
he
whispered
back
,
with
the
faintest
of
faint
smiles
.
"
I
've
taken
the
stake
money
,
"
she
said
.
He
nodded
imperceptibly
.
"
Sorry
you
-
but
it
was
n't
my
fault
,
was
it
?
"
she
said
.
He
gave
a
slow
shake
of
his
head
.
She
pulled
the
bed
cover
over
him
.
"
'Bye
darling
.
Feel
better
soon
.
Look
me
up
again
when
you
are
next
in
town
,
wo
n't
you
?
We
must
complete
the
course
.
"
Mark
woke
to
the
strangely
sad
and
beautiful
cry
of
the
Muezzin
,
whose
plaintive
voice
drifted
across
the
ancient
city
to
greet
another
dawn
.
The
pains
in
his
head
had
subsided
,
but
he
felt
dizzy
and
sick
,
which
he
concluded
was
not
surprising
,
considering
the
amount
of
alcohol
he
had
drunk
the
day
before
.
He
attempted
to
go
to
the
bathroom
,
but
found
that
his
left
leg
would
n't
respond
.
It
felt
heavy
and
lifeless
,
in
much
the
same
way
as
it
had
felt
that
day
in
Spain
when
he
had
gone
off
the
road
.
He
rolled
on
to
his
side
and
rubbed
the
leg
vigorously
with
his
right
hand
.
After
a
few
minutes
he
heaved
himself
out
of
bed
,
but
his
leg
let
him
down
and
he
fell
backwards
.
From
a
sitting
position
he
rubbed
and
thumped
the
leg
until
it
responded
sufficiently
for
him
to
drag
himself
to
the
bathroom
.
It
was
five
o'clock
.
Hauling
himself
back
to
bed
he
lay
awake
for
some
time
,
before
falling
asleep
.
When
he
awoke
again
it
was
seven
.
To
his
great
relief
he
found
that
the
pains
in
his
head
had
almost
gone
and
that
he
could
now
move
his
left
leg
,
albeit
with
some
difficulty
.
After
a
while
he
was
able
to
stand
.
He
then
walked
slowly
and
gingerly
towards
the
bathroom
,
keeping
as
much
weight
as
possible
on
his
right
leg
.
A
hot
bath
,
followed
by
a
cold
shower
worked
wonders
for
his
circulation
,
and
he
was
now
able
to
move
more
freely
,
though
still
with
a
pronounced
limp
.
He
shaved
,
got
dressed
and
took
the
elevator
to
the
breakfast-room
.
He
felt
in
reasonable
shape
,
as
he
entered
the
local
MDs
office
.
Nate
Cocello
,
President
of
United
Motors
,
had
flown
into
London
from
Detroit
with
a
posse
of
Vice
Presidents
to
attend
the
bi-monthly
meeting
of
the
European
Planning
committee
.
Chauffeurs
had
met
them
at
their
Inn
on
the
Park
hotel
,
at
seven
o'clock
sharp
;
and
at
five
minutes
to
eight
they
had
taken
their
seats
around
the
long
elliptical
table
at
European
headquarters
to
ensure
the
meeting
began
on
time
,
at
precisely
eight
o'clock
.
Randy
Mueller
was
darting
from
one
Vice
President
to
another
like
an
agitated
blue-bottle
.
He
was
first
on
with
his
presentation
,
and
had
been
there
since
six-thirty
to
make
sure
there
were
no
slip-ups
with
his
slide
presentation
.
He
began
by
saying
how
glad
he
was
to
be
in
Europe
again
,
which
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
outline
some
of
the
developments
taking
place
in
other
regions
of
the
world
,
and
to
describe
the
next
phase
in
the
development
of
the
world
car
.
He
highlighted
the
different
approaches
being
made
by
the
regions
,
putting
sufficient
emphasis
on
the
distinctions
and
duplications
to
enable
the
assembled
company
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
:
namely
,
that
the
international
business
was
getting
too
big
for
the
regions
to
handle
,
and
that
the
variations
would
lead
to
unnecessary
proliferation
if
they
were
n't
effectively
controlled
and
directed
by
Detroit
.
European
General
Director
Clancy
McGillicuddy
coughed
and
spluttered
at
the
innuendo
and
the
local
European
Managing
Directors
were
n't
exactly
overjoyed
.
They
cast
furtive
glances
at
one
another
.
Nate
Cocello
allowed
a
knowing
smile
to
cross
his
face
at
what
he
knew
would
be
the
natural
reactions
of
line
managers
.
He
had
been
one
himself
.
Mueller
strode
through
the
presentation
aggressively
.
Was
there
any
other
way
?
Throwing
up
slides
to
make
a
point
here
,
and
stepping
aside
from
the
podium
to
develop
a
theme
there
,
he
exuded
great
confidence
in
the
future
of
the
great
corporation
.
He
ended
his
presentation
of
forty-five
minutes
precisely
,
with
the
words
,
"
We
have
been
the
number
one
in
the
United
States
for
many
years
,
now
we
aim
to
be
the
number
one
in
Europe
,
in
South
America
,
the
Middle
East
-
.
"
"
And
all
stations
west
of
downtown
Detroit
,
"
whispered
Don
Peters
under
his
breath
.
The
President
and
Chief
Executive
Officer
looked
around
the
table
.
Spotting
Muldoon
,
he
asked
,
"
Any
comments
,
Pat
,
from
a
components
viewpoint
?
"
"
Not
at
this
stage
,
"
Muldoon
replied
nervously
.
"
How
about
you
,
Mark
-
.
"
began
the
top
man
,
his
eyes
searching
the
long
table
for
the
Englishman
.
"
Say
,
where
is
Mark
?
"
he
asked
,
not
being
able
to
spot
him
.
"
He
's
here
,
is
n't
he
?
,
There
was
an
uncomfortable
and
meaningful
silence
.
Other
executives
had
already
asked
themselves
the
same
question
.
The
main
item
on
the
agenda
was
the
Components
"
Business
Plan
.
It
was
really
Mark
's
show
.
Where
the
hell
was
he
?
"
Ah
-
.
He
could
n't
make
it
,
"
Muldoon
replied
breathlessly
.
"
Fred
Klepner
here
is
standing
in
.
That
's
right
,
Randy
,
is
n't
it
?
"
he
asked
,
calling
across
the
table
to
get
the
question
off
his
back
.
"
Yeah
,
Nate
,
"
Mueller
interjected
confidently
.
"
We
got
problems
in
Turkey
.
Mark
was
out
there
at
the
time
,
so
we
asked
him
to
help
us
sort
it
out
.
He
's
taking
a
few
days
"
vacation
out
there
,
right
now
,
so
Pat
and
I
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
let
Fred
Klepner
stand
in
.
He
's
been
helping
Mark
put
together
the
Business
Plan
and
the
presentation
.
That
's
right
Pat
,
is
n't
it
?
"
he
asked
,
getting
the
tricky
subject
off
his
shoulders
.
"
Yeah
.
That
's
right
,
Randy
,
"
the
nervous
American
replied
,
almost
choking
on
the
words
.
The
top
man
was
both
amazed
and
damned
angry
that
Mark
was
n't
there
.
Dammit
,
the
Components
Plan
was
the
main
subject
on
the
agenda
.
He
himself
had
specifically
told
Mark
and
Muldoon
that
he
proposed
to
attend
the
meeting
.
What
was
more
important
than
that
?
And
surely
,
nobody
in
his
right
mind
would
take
a
few
days
'
vacation
and
miss
out
on
the
opportunity
of
selling
his
own
plans
and
proposals
to
the
President
of
the
Corporation
?
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
his
face
expressing
his
thoughts
.
Every
executive
around
the
table
could
see
that
he
was
visibly
annoyed
by
the
Englishman
's
absence
.
They
were
under
no
illusions
.
If
the
Englishman
had
n't
blotted
his
copybook
before
,
he
certainly
had
now
.
"
O
K.
Let's
move
on
,
"
said
the
President
after
a
long
and
pregnant
pause
.
"
Ye
Gods
!
"
he
muttered
,
loud
enough
for
all
to
hear
.
"
Can
you
beat
it
!
"
The
components
presentation
came
on
after
lunch
.
Muldoon
nervously
introduced
the
plan
,
saying
that
as
Fred
Klepner
had
been
over
on
special
assignment
from
Detroit
to
help
Mark
in
the
final
preparation
of
the
Plan
and
the
presentation
,
he
would
hand
over
to
Fred
and
let
him
take
the
committee
through
the
proposals
.
Klepner
's
big
moment
had
arrived
and
the
ex-Harvard
Business
School
man
strode
confidently
to
the
podium
.
He
had
worked
long
hours
to
acquire
a
complete
understanding
of
the
Plan
and
to
learn
Mark
's
presentation
word
for
word
.
He
proceeded
to
explain
the
Plan
,
starting
with
a
brief
review
of
the
world
components
market
which
positioned
Europe
to
the
rest
of
the
world
and
led
straight
into
the
Plan
.
The
political
and
economic
background
and
outlook
was
described
,
country
by
country
,
together
with
the
principal
assumptions
on
which
the
Plan
was
based
.
This
led
into
a
technical
and
commercial
appraisal
of
European
competition
and
the
anticipated
market
changes
over
the
next
ten
years
.
Existing
low
profit
products
were
to
be
corrected
with
a
cost
reduction
and
profit
improvement
plan
,
or
chased
out
where
such
improvements
were
not
economically
feasible
.
New
products
were
to
be
introduced
with
new
plants
to
be
located
from
a
short
list
of
low
cost
countries
:
namely
Spain
,
Austria
,
France
,
Portugal
and
the
United
Kingdom
.
A
manpower
resources
'
plan
summarised
the
personnel
requirements
by
skill
category
and
headcount
,
together
with
the
required
training
programme
.
The
financial
plan
showed
the
investment
impact
on
sales
,
profit
and
return
on
investment
per
year
over
the
next
ten
years
,
while
the
financing
plan
described
how
the
investment
was
to
be
financed
:
namely
,
from
borrowings
in
the
early
years
until
the
plan
became
self-financing
from
funds
accrued
from
current
operations
,
in
year
four
.
The
forty-five
minute
presentation
concluded
with
a
summary
of
the
overall
effect
of
the
Plan
on
total
European
operations
.
It
appeared
to
roll
forward
and
unfold
under
its
own
natural
momentum
,
to
reach
its
clearly
defined
objectives
.
It
came
across
to
Cocello
and
the
committee
in
such
a
way
that
the
presenter
could
n't
help
but
benefit
from
being
associated
with
it
.
Klepner
stepped
down
from
the
podium
and
waited
for
questions
and
observations
.
"
Fine
plan
you
have
there
,
Pat
,
"
said
the
President
approvingly
.
"
I
like
it
.
"
Turning
toward
Klepner
he
nodded
his
approval
.
"
Excellent
presentation
,
Fred
.
Obviously
a
lot
of
thought
has
gone
into
the
plan
.
It
's
good
.
Fine
job
.
"
Klepner
kept
a
straight
face
,
but
was
overjoyed
at
the
top
man
's
response
.
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
"
Randy
Mueller
put
the
first
question
but
,
before
doing
so
,
added
his
congratulations
to
those
of
the
President
.
"
Good
show
,
Fred
.
You
've
done
a
fine
job
over
here
,
"
he
said
,
omnisciently
,
with
the
air
of
a
superior
conferring
praise
on
a
subordinate
.
"
Would
you
care
to
explain
to
the
committee
why
you
are
considering
the
UK
in
your
short
list
of
countries
to
be
considered
for
the
new
investment
proposals
.
I
thought
we
'd
all
agreed
at
previous
meetings
that
,
with
minor
exceptions
,
all
the
major
new
plants
would
be
located
on
the
continent
?
"
The
question
was
simply
a
put-up
job
,
Mueller
having
previously
primed
both
Klepner
and
Muldoon
.
The
question
was
designed
to
give
Klepner
the
opportunity
to
express
a
contrary
view
to
Sanders
,
which
,
in
effect
,
was
that
there
should
be
no
further
new
investment
in
the
United
Kingdom
.
"
We
've
included
the
UK
on
the
short
list
,
at
this
stage
,
"
said
Klepner
,
"
because
Mark
says
that
when
the
task
force
teams
come
to
prepare
the
comparative
cost
studies
in
detail
they
will
find
that
the
economics
of
manufacturing
certain
new
products
will
almost
certainly
favour
production
in
the
UK
.
Mark
takes
the
view
that
if
the
UK
is
not
to
be
considered
for
other
than
economic
reasons
,
then
that
's
a
matter
for
the
committee
and
the
Corporation
to
decide
.
But
he
wants
all
the
facts
to
be
presented
to
the
committee
before
a
corporate
decision
is
made
not
to
invest
in
the
UK
.
"
What
do
you
,
personally
,
think
about
that
approach
,
Fred
?
"
Mueller
asked
.
"
Well
,
I
guess
I
agree
with
the
committee
's
original
view
that
we
should
not
put
any
major
new
investment
in
the
UK
,
"
Klepner
replied
,
knowing
full
well
that
this
line
would
be
supported
by
Mueller
and
most
of
the
Americans
around
the
table
.
Mueller
turned
to
Muldoon
.
"
What
do
you
think
,
Pat
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Muldoon
coughed
nervously
"
I
tend
to
agree
with
Fred
,
"
he
replied
.
Mueller
then
turned
to
the
American
Managing
Director
in
charge
of
the
British
Components
'
Division
,
who
was
due
for
another
assignment
after
nearly
two
years
in
the
UK
.
He
too
knew
the
score
.
"
What
do
you
think
,
Hal
?
"
asked
Mueller
.
"
Waal
,
based
on
the
UK
track
record
in
recent
years
,
I
guess
I
got
ta
go
along
with
Pat
and
Fred
,
"
he
replied
,
shaking
his
head
slowly
.
Cocello
had
listened
without
interruption
.
He
addressed
Muldoon
.
"
Let
me
get
this
straight
,
Pat
,
"
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
.
"
You
got
ta
European
plan
which
includes
certain
major
new
investment
proposals
in
the
UK
subject
to
detailed
economic
justification
by
the
special
task
force
teams
.
But
you
and
Fred
and
Hal
do
n't
go
along
with
UK
investment
.
Is
that
right
?
Is
that
what
you
're
sayin'
?
"
Muldoon
shuffled
his
papers
nervously
.
"
Waal
,
I
guess
I
am
and
I
ai
n't
,
"
he
replied
.
"
What
the
hell
does
that
mean
?
"
asked
Cocello
irritably
.
Muldoon
looked
to
Mueller
for
support
.
"
Waal
,
I
guess
I
'm
all
in
favour
of
the
European
plan
,
"
he
stuttered
.
"
I
agree
with
you
Nate
-
I
think
it
's
a
good
one
,
a
damned
good
one
.
But
I
also
agree
with
Randy
here
,
and
with
Fred
and
Hal
,
that
I
'm
not
so
sure
about
the
UK
side
of
the
plan
.
"
"
The
President
grunted
and
turned
his
attention
to
McGillicuddy
.
"
Sounds
to
me
,
Clancy
,
that
you
European
guys
ai
n't
quite
made
up
your
minds
about
the
UK
,
"
he
said
.
Turning
to
Don
Peters
,
he
added
,
"
How
about
you
,
Don
?
They
tell
me
that
your
proposals
tomorrow
will
show
the
UK
coming
good
-
is
that
right
?
"
Don
Peters
smiled
and
nodded
his
head
.
"
That
's
right
,
Nate
,
"
he
replied
confidently
.
"
You
'll
hear
our
proposals
tomorrow
but
we
are
now
beginning
to
see
real
signs
of
a
big
improvement
at
our
UK
vehicle
plants
.
All
the
indications
are
that
we
are
now
forging
ahead
.
We
think
that
the
UK
is
bullish
in
the
years
ahead
and
we
are
backing
our
judgement
with
further
investment
proposals
.
"
Several
Americans
around
the
long
table
,
including
Mueller
and
the
head
of
the
British
Components
division
,
were
shaking
their
heads
slowly
.
Peters
saw
their
reactions
and
knew
instinctively
that
he
was
going
to
have
one
hell
of
a
fight
on
his
hands
the
next
day
to
convince
the
committee
of
his
vehicle
division
proposals
.
Fred
Clasper
's
disruptive
plan
had
been
well
prepared
.
In
addition
to
the
work
of
a
small
but
dedicated
group
of
left
wing
militants
who
held
shop
stewardships
at
the
Merseyside
plant
,
he
had
received
expert
academic
advice
from
two
university
lecturers
who
were
sympathetic
to
the
Communist
international
cause
.
One
was
a
lecturer
at
Oxford
,
the
other
at
Liverpool
University
.
Like
all
such
schemes
prepared
by
left-wing
militants
,
this
plan
was
aimed
at
putting
the
company
in
a
"
Catch
22
"
situation
.
Namely
,
whatever
action
the
company
took
,
it
would
be
blamed
for
the
ensuing
conflict
.
To
this
end
,
one
of
the
younger
Communist
shop
stewards
in
the
plot
had
agreed
to
be
the
fall
guy
.
It
was
not
a
particularly
difficult
decision
for
him
to
come
to
,
since
he
was
going
to
emigrate
to
Australia
anyway
.
Company
rules
stated
that
,
before
a
person
could
be
dismissed
for
misconduct
,
two
previous
warning
notes
had
to
be
formally
given
to
the
offender
,
placing
on
record
the
gravity
of
the
offence
.
Dismissal
following
automatically
if
a
third
serious
offence
was
committed
.
The
young
Communist
shop
steward
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
first
two
warning
notes
.
He
had
switched-off
the
assembly
track
one
Friday
afternoon
,
half
an
hour
before
finishing
time
,
ostensibly
on
the
grounds
that
the
overhead
conveyor
was
unsafe
and
a
danger
to
line
operators
working
below
.
The
foreman
had
naturally
hit
the
roof
over
the
loss
of
thirty
minutes
'
production
,
which
would
pull
down
his
departmental
output
and
efficiency
target
and
had
roundly
reprimanded
the
shop
steward
for
taking
such
unauthorised
action
without
first
bringing
the
alleged
safety
hazard
to
his
attention
,
in
line
with
normal
company
standard
practice
.
There
was
,
of
course
,
no
such
safety
problem
,
as
the
safety
inspector
subsequently
confirmed
,
and
the
steward
was
given
the
first
of
the
warning
notes
,
as
planned
.
He
obtained
the
second
by
pretending
to
trip
over
an
unseen
obstacle
,
which
inadvertently
threw
him
against
the
foreman
,
knocking
him
to
the
ground
and
depositing
his
daily
schedule
papers
all
over
the
floor
.
Both
men
had
leapt
to
their
feet
and
had
been
restrained
from
using
violence
by
the
mates
of
the
shop
steward
,
who
just
happened
to
be
on
hand
.
One
of
the
two
witnesses
,
who
also
just
happened
to
be
the
convener
,
Fred
Clasper
,
claimed
that
a
second
warning
note
was
unjustified
as
the
foreman
had
been
knocked
down
unintentionally
.
Nevertheless
,
as
planned
,
a
second
warning
note
was
issued
.
After
both
incidents
,
Clasper
had
made
it
known
,
throughout
the
plant
,
that
the
young
shop
steward
was
being
victimised
and
harassed
by
the
foreman
while
on
legitimate
union
business
.
It
was
alleged
by
Clasper
that
the
foreman
had
his
knife
in
the
young
kid
who
was
only
doing
his
job
.
"
The
foreman
is
out
to
get
him
"
was
the
expression
making
the
departmental
rounds
.
Clasper
and
the
conspirators
timed
the
third
offence
to
coincide
with
the
visit
to
the
UK
of
the
President
and
Chief
Executive
Officer
of
United
Motors
,
Nate
Cocello
,
as
this
would
provide
maximum
publicity
to
the
planned
strike
.
An
attempt
would
then
be
made
to
drag
Cocello
into
the
dispute
by
Clasper
making
a
public
appeal
to
the
President
to
reinstate
the
sacked
shop
steward
over
the
heads
of
plant
and
divisional
management
.
Either
way
,
Clasper
would
win
.
The
strike
would
once
again
demonstrate
the
power
of
the
unions
and
would
also
restore
Clasper
's
own
flagging
personal
influence
and
power
over
the
workers
.
While
Don
Peters
was
on
his
feet
on
the
second
day
of
the
meeting
of
the
European
Planning
Committee
,
explaining
his
plan
to
rejuvenate
the
ailing
British
vehicle
division
,
Fred
Clasper
was
also
on
his
feet
setting
in
motion
his
scheme
to
put
the
final
nail
in
its
coffin
.
Don
Peters
knew
when
he
went
to
the
podium
that
the
odds
were
stacked
heavily
against
him
gaining
the
support
of
Nate
Cocello
and
the
committee
.
The
American
's
performance
at
the
podium
was
masterly
.
He
began
by
saying
that
with
the
UK
vehicle
division
's
track
record
over
recent
years
,
he
could
n't
really
expect
to
receive
any
support
to
the
plan
he
was
about
to
describe
.
He
then
went
on
to
identify
each
and
every
major
problem
which
affected
cost
and
profit
performance
,
quantifying
each
problem
area
and
finally
consolidating
the
total
cost
penalty
at
no
less
than
four
hundred
million
dollars
.
He
then
described
his
proposals
to
reduce
that
cost
penalty
and
turn
the
division
from
an
operating
loss
into
a
satisfactory
profit
and
return
on
investment
.
Finally
,
he
threw
up
slides
showing
the
improvements
which
had
already
been
achieved
over
the
last
three
months
.
What
came
across
to
Nate
and
the
committee
,
most
of
all
,
was
Peters
the
leader
.
He
had
been
given
a
tough
assignment
and
he
was
in
there
fighting
like
hell
on
behalf
of
the
British
vehicle
division
.
He
gave
credit
to
local
management
and
to
the
unions
,
singling
out
the
name
of
Clem
Bunker
for
most
of
the
industrial
relations
improvements
coming
through
.
He
ended
his
hour-long
presentation
with
the
words
,
"
We
are
on
our
way
toward
making
the
division
one
of
the
best
goddamned
outfits
in
overseas
operations
,
and
I
just
want
to
be
given
the
chance
to
prove
that
the
plan
which
I
have
outlined
to
you
today
is
the
right
one
for
the
British
operation
,
for
Europe
and
for
the
Corporation
.
"
Even
Americans
round
the
table
,
who
did
n't
give
him
a
snowball
in
hell
's
chance
of
getting
approval
to
his
plan
,
had
to
admit
that
he
was
still
in
there
,
fighting
like
a
demon
for
a
lost
cause
.
He
handled
the
many
questions
in
masterly
fashion
,
particularly
the
probing
questions
from
Cocello
.
He
was
in
the
hot
seat
for
more
than
three
hours
.
He
had
gone
to
the
podium
at
eight
o
"
clock
.
By
noon
he
had
obtained
Nate
's
approval
and
had
won
the
day
.
The
Merseyside
convener
was
aware
that
President
Nate
Cocello
was
coming
to
the
UK
for
talks
with
British
and
European
management
.
The
grapevine
always
flashed
advance
notice
of
such
events
,
though
it
was
never
hard
to
guess
when
a
VIP
visit
was
imminent
because
of
the
frenzied
housekeeping
activity
at
each
plant
which
always
preceded
it
.
Clasper
saw
Cocello
's
arrival
at
Heathrow
on
television
.
When
asked
by
an
interviewer
if
he
was
pleased
with
the
performance
of
the
British
plants
,
the
President
had
replied
that
although
past
performance
had
been
bad
by
traditional
British
standards
,
he
was
now
happy
to
say
that
in
recent
months
a
marked
improvement
had
taken
place
.
This
enabled
him
to
look
forward
with
confidence
to
continued
improvements
which
would
put
the
British
plants
back
at
the
top
of
the
performance
league
,
where
they
used
to
be
,
and
where
they
belonged
.
Clasper
had
other
ideas
,
however
.
On
the
day
that
Don
Peters
was
on
his
feet
at
the
EPC
meeting
,
fighting
for
the
survival
of
the
British
Vehicle
Division
and
the
jobs
of
the
fifty
thousand
people
it
employed
,
Fred
Clasper
was
setting
in
motion
the
third
and
final
stage
of
his
scheme
to
sabotage
any
possible
chance
of
the
company
's
recovery
.
It
had
been
arranged
by
the
conspirators
that
the
young
shop
steward
,
who
had
already
collected
two
warning
notes
as
planned
,
would
take
out
a
set
of
spark
plugs
in
his
lunch
box
at
the
mid-day
break
.
One
of
the
conspirators
would
ring
the
foreman
to
tip
him
off
that
the
shop
steward
could
be
caught
red-handed
stealing
company
property
if
they
searched
him
at
the
gate
.
The
foreman
would
naturally
advise
the
security
men
on
the
gate
,
and
Personnel
Department
,
which
would
result
in
the
steward
being
apprehended
and
instantly
dismissed
.
He
would
plead
that
the
plugs
had
been
planted
by
someone
who
bore
a
grudge
against
him
,
and
the
story
would
be
quickly
put
round
the
plant
that
it
was
the
foreman
himself
who
had
fixed
it
,
to
settle
an
old
score
.
Credibility
would
be
given
to
the
shop
steward
's
story
by
having
his
lunch
box
placed
in
an
unauthorised
position
on
the
assembly
track
from
which
the
foreman
would
have
to
remove
it
,
and
be
seen
doing
so
.
Everything
went
according
to
plan
and
at
noon
the
steward
was
stopped
at
the
gate
.
The
spark
plugs
were
found
in
the
lunch
box
as
arranged
and
he
was
immediately
dismissed
in
accordance
with
company
practice
.
In
itself
,
the
offence
justified
instant
dismissal
under
company
rules
.
The
two
previous
warnings
received
by
the
steward
made
it
inevitable
.
Clasper
was
present
in
the
Personnel
Manager
s
office
when
the
offence
was
read
and
the
dismissal
notice
formally
handed
out
.
That
afternoon
the
convener
communicated
his
version
of
the
story
to
the
shop
steward
's
committee
and
within
an
hour
every
department
was
buzzing
with
the
news
.
It
was
well
known
that
the
foreman
and
the
shop
steward
in
question
were
always
in
dispute
,
and
it
appeared
to
the
majority
that
the
foreman
had
,
in
fact
,
set
him
up
to
get
rid
of
him
and
to
settle
an
old
account
.
Production
was
severely
disrupted
in
all
departments
during
the
afternoon
as
the
shop
stewards
spread
the
message
.
At
four
o'clock
they
fed
back
the
feelings
of
the
workers
to
the
convener
,
and
at
five
minutes
past
four
,
Clasper
took
the
giant
plant
out
on
strike
,
advising
the
Personnel
and
Plant
Managers
that
they
would
n't
return
until
the
sacked
shop
steward
had
been
re-instated
.
The
majority
had
no
wish
to
stop
work
,
particularly
after
the
great
strides
which
had
been
made
in
recent
months
,
but
they
were
n't
going
to
be
sat
on
either
.
To
them
it
sounded
like
a
straight
forward
case
of
victimisation
by
the
foreman
.
The
message
that
the
big
Merseyside
plant
was
out
on
strike
was
conveyed
to
Don
Peters
at
the
EPC
meeting
.
One
of
the
secretaries
entered
the
conference
room
with
a
message
to
ring
the
Plant
Manager
urgently
.
"
The
plant
has
stopped
work
,
"
she
added
.
The
pain
on
the
American
's
face
was
clear
for
all
to
see
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
left
the
meeting
to
make
the
call
.
On
his
return
,
he
immediately
communicated
the
bad
news
to
his
boss
,
Clancy
McGillicuddy
,
and
to
Nate
Cocello
,
by
handing
them
a
copy
of
the
statement
put
out
by
the
Plant
Manager
.
Nate
closed
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
in
disbelief
.
Clancy
McGillicuddy
was
furious
.
What
in
God
's
name
had
happened
to
the
British
?
Peters
nodded
his
agreement
.
"
Yeah
,
"
he
sighed
.
"
Yeah
,
Nate
.
I
know
.
I
know
.
"
The
President
shook
his
head
.
"
I
'm
not
blaming
you
,
Don
.
You
've
worked
your
arse
off
to
solve
this
problem
.
But
they
ai
n't
gon
na
let
anyone
help
'em
.
Those
Merseyside
bastards
are
hellbent
on
destroyin'
themselves
and
every
poor
management
sod
unlucky
enough
to
be
involved
with
the
plant
.
It
's
a
bloody
graveyard
of
top
talent
.
"
"
Yeah
.
Yeah
,
Nate
,
"
Peters
sighed
again
.
"
I
'm
afraid
it
looks
that
way
.
But
the
plan
is
a
good
one
,
and
it
would
work
,
if
only
they
'd
give
it
a
chance
.
"
All
the
infectious
enthusiasm
had
gone
out
of
his
voice
and
manner
.
"
Sure
.
But
they
wo
n't
,
"
the
top
man
replied
.
"
So
we
'll
have
to
change
direction
.
I
'll
tell
Mueller
to
get
a
team
down
here
from
Detroit
to
get
things
started
.
The
locals
ai
n't
gon
na
like
it
,
but
they
've
ballsed-up
their
chances
.
From
here
on
in
,
we
go
back
to
the
original
plan
to
phase-out
vehicle
manufacture
in
the
UK
and
import
instead
.
Passenger
cars
from
Germany
,
Belgium
and
the
proposed
Spanish
plant
,
and
commercial
vehicles
from
our
new
joint
venture
operation
in
Japan
.
We
just
ca
n't
take
any
more
risks
by
manufacturing
in
the
UK
.
It
"
s
too
damned
unreliable
.
Do
n't
you
agree
,
Clancy
?
"
"
Wish
I
could
disagree
with
you
,
Nate
,
but
I
ca
n't
,
"
replied
the
European
General
Director
.
After
dinner
that
evening
,
Cocello
instructed
Randy
Mueller
to
set
up
a
task
force
team
from
Detroit
to
come
up
with
a
phase-out
plan
for
vehicle
manufacture
,
and
a
phase-in
plan
for
supplying
the
UK
market
from
imports
,
"
It
's
got
ta
be
the
right
thing
to
do
,
"
agreed
Mueller
readily
.
"
Today
's
events
only
confirmed
what
we
already
knew
.
"
Cocello
nodded
sadly
.
As
an
afterthought
,
Mueller
added
,
"
What
about
the
Components
"
Plan
?
Do
we
go
ahead
with
the
UK
side
of
that
?
Or
do
we
phase
that
out
,
too
?
"
He
hurried
on
.
"
Guess
we
should
be
consistent
,
should
n't
we
?
We
can
hardly
tell
the
Finance
and
Executive
Committee
that
the
British
are
unreliable
at
the
vehicle
plants
,
but
as
solid
as
the
Rock
of
Gibraltar
when
it
comes
to
components
.
"
"
No
,
we
ca
n't
,
,
Cocello
agreed
.
"
Though
for
some
totally
inexplicable
reason
that
seems
to
be
the
truth
.
But
you
're
right
,
Randy
.
The
Components
"
Plan
would
lose
all
credibility
if
we
included
the
UK
.
Better
tell
Muldoon
to
make
the
necessary
changes
.
"
Mueller
immediately
saw
his
opportunity
.
"
Why
do
n't
I
get
the
Detroit
task
force
team
to
co-ordinate
both
the
vehicle
and
components
"
phase-out
plans
in
the
UK
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Sure
as
hell
the
locals
ai
n't
gon
na
like
doing
it
themselves
.
We
'd
be
fightin'
a
never-ending
rearguard
battle
with
those
guys
.
Sanders
also
ai
n't
gon
na
like
it
,
that
's
for
sure
.
He
'll
be
fightin'
for
his
European
Plan
as
submitted
;
including
the
UK
element
.
"
"
Yeah
.
Perhaps
you
're
right
Randy
,
"
said
the
top
man
.
"
Maybe
you
should
take
both
plans
on
board
and
control
them
from
Detroit
.
At
least
that
means
that
we
can
do
it
our
way
.
Sanders
ca
n't
be
all
that
interested
in
the
Plan
if
he
takes
a
few
days
vacation
rather
than
give
the
presentation
.
Jeez
,
that
amazes
me
,
as
well
as
riles
me.
"
he
added
,
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
.
"
What
makes
a
guy
like
that
behave
that
way
?
I
just
do
n't
understand
it
.
"
Mueller
never
turned
a
hair
,
or
felt
a
twinge
of
remorse
.
As
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
he
had
just
knocked
another
competitor
out
of
the
promotion
stakes
.
"
It
's
got
ta
be
right
,
chief
,
"
he
replied
enthusiastically
.
"
I
do
n't
think
we
can
really
plan
overseas
"
operations
effectively
,
until
we
get
full
planning
control
from
Detroit
.
The
European
operation
is
too
damned
big
a
slice
of
the
corporate
business
to
be
left
to
the
locals
.
Today
's
events
only
confirm
what
we
've
been
sayin'
.
"
The
President
and
Chief
Executive
officer
gazed
into
his
Scotch
.
He
was
still
uneasy
about
Mueller
.
He
remembered
what
he
had
put
on
his
personal
qualities
'
file
:
"
Judgement
not
always
reliable
in
the
political
and
commercial
area
"
.
He
looked
long
and
hard
at
the
younger
executive
as
if
trying
to
sum
him
up
.
"
OK
,
Randy
,
"
he
said
after
a
long
pause
.
"
Go
ahead
.
The
Committee
agreed
in
principle
to
your
initial
proposals
.
Not
unanimously
,
mark
you
,
but
the
majority
.
Put
up
a
detailed
proposal
for
consideration
when
we
get
back
,
and
we
'll
see
if
they
buy
the
specifics
.
"
That
same
evening
Mark
Sanders
was
dining
alone
in
Istanbul
after
a
satisfactory
series
of
meetings
with
the
local
Managing
Director
and
the
Turkish
Minister
of
Economic
Affairs
.
He
had
declined
an
invitation
to
dinner
,
as
the
stabbing
pains
in
his
head
had
been
getting
steadily
worse
throughout
the
day
.
They
were
now
blindingly
bad
.
He
placed
his
unfinished
cigar
in
the
ash
tray
and
rose
from
the
table
,
leaving
his
brandy
untouched
.
He
had
decided
to
go
to
bed
early
.
After
lying
in
a
hot
bath
for
an
unusually
long
time
,
he
stretched
out
on
the
bed
,
eyes
closed
,
hoping
that
the
pains
would
go
away
.
But
he
could
n't
get
the
thought
out
of
his
head
that
in
London
,
that
very
day
,
Muldoon
and
Klepner
had
given
HIS
Ten
Year
Plan
to
Cocello
.
The
more
he
thought
of
the
two
carpet-baggers
standing
up
at
the
podium
,
the
more
intense
the
pains
in
his
head
became
.
He
put
a
hand
to
his
forehead
to
ease
the
pressure
.
Nate
could
n't
possibly
have
believed
that
the
Turkish
problem
was
more
important
than
the
European
Plan
.
Not
in
a
million
years
.
In
which
case
the
reason
was
blindingly
obvious
.
Muldoon
had
more
than
hinted
at
what
was
happening
.
Detroit
was
paving
the
way
for
Mueller
to
take
over
and
run
the
whole
bloody
show
from
America
.
That
's
what
he
had
always
wanted
to
do
,
and
Klepner
was
his
advance
guard
.
His
mole
.
His
trained
pet
poodle
who
had
been
sent
to
Europe
to
reconnoitre
the
scene
and
steal
Mark
's
clothes
.
He
would
then
take
over
the
European
Components
'
planning
activity
when
everything
was
centralised
in
Detroit
.
He
thumped
his
pillow
with
his
fist
.
The
bastards
are
at
it
again
,
he
said
to
himself
,
vividly
recalling
the
Steiner
incident
in
New
York
.
Only
this
time
it
's
curtains
.
He
was
finished
.
This
had
got
to
be
the
end
of
the
road
.
He
stared
at
the
ceiling
.
How
would
he
and
Georgina
change
their
lifestyle
after
all
those
years
as
a
corporate
executive
?
How
would
they
live
?
What
would
happen
when
the
monthly
cheque
was
no
longer
paid
into
the
bank
?
What
about
the
mortgage
and
the
school
fees
?
They
go
on
for
ever
.
Well
,
until
sixty-five
,
and
that
's
a
hell
of
a
long
way
away
.
What
would
they
do
in
the
interim
?
They
'd
have
to
move
to
a
smaller
house
,
that
's
for
sure
.
My
God
,
how
would
he
tell
Georgina
?
It
would
break
her
heart
to
leave
the
lovely
old
stone
barn
in
Buckinghamshire
.
How
could
he
keep
Andrew
at
Agricultural
college
?
Well
they
would
,
somehow
or
other
.
They
'd
done
it
for
Adam
and
Christopher
and
they
'd
do
it
for
him
.
But
how
would
he
break
the
news
to
Georgina
that
he
'd
let
her
down
after
all
these
years
?
He
fell
asleep
,
but
the
pains
in
his
head
were
still
there
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
.
Clem
Bunker
was
in
a
rare-rage
.
He
had
completely
lost
his
temper
when
he
had
heard
the
news
that
Clasper
had
taken
the
giant
Merseyside
plant
out
on
strike
.
Bunker
had
received
the
message
from
a
convener
at
one
of
the
Midlands
plants
,
who
was
also
hopping
mad
.
And
so
,
he
said
,
were
all
the
shop
stewards
at
his
plant
,
who
were
expressing
the
view
that
,
once
again
,
the
Merseysiders
were
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands
,
breaking
national
agreements
and
overturning
official
union
policy
.
The
Midlands
'
shop
stewards
knew
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
before
the
strike
affected
supplies
to
their
own
plants
and
those
in
the
South
,
jeopardising
the
recovery
plan
which
had
been
producing
such
vast
improvements
in
performance
.
Morale
had
been
at
its
highest
for
years
,
up
to
the
moment
that
the
news
had
reached
them
that
Merseyside
was
out
.
"
Clasper
's
behind
this
!
"
Bunker
was
furious
.
"
He
was
dead
against
the
plan
and
now
he
's
doing
his
damnedest
to
wreck
it
.
"
"
That
's
what
everyone
round
here
is
saying
as
well
,
"
the
convener
agreed
.
"
It
's
his
Commie
mate
who
got
the
chop
.
And
nobody
believes
Clasper
's
version
of
the
story
.
It
's
all
too
bloody
coincidental
.
"
"
Is
that
really
the
majority
view
at
your
plant
?
"
"
Well
,
it
's
not
often
the
majority
express
themselves
without
some
prompting
from
the
shop
stewards
,
"
the
convener
replied
,
"
but
in
this
instance
the
reaction
was
instantaneous
.
We
heard
the
news
over
the
radio
at
lunch
break
and
I
tell
you
,
Clem
,
my
lads
are
really
up
in
arms
.
Nobody
believes
this
cock
and
bull
story
about
the
sacking
incident
.
They
all
know
that
Clasper
's
behind
it
.
Who
the
hell
does
he
think
he
's
kiddin'
?
He
's
certainly
not
kiddin'
my
blokes
.
"
"
Is
that
what
the
majority
are
really
saying
at
your
plant
?
"
asked
Bunker
.
"
Loud
and
clear
,
"
replied
the
convener
.
"
They
are
sick
to
the
eyeballs
with
Clasper
and
his
bloody
political
conscience
strikes
.
A
hell
of
a
roar
went
up
in
the
canteen
at
lunch
break
when
one
of
the
shop
stewards
said
that
Clasper
would
go
on
fighting
on
behalf
of
the
workers
until
every
bloody
one
of
them
had
lost
their
jobs
.
That
's
what
my
lads
think
about
Mister
bloody
Clasper
.
The
question
is
,
Clem
,
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
?
"
"
I
"
m
going
to
contact
all
the
plant
conveners
,
when
I
put
this
phone
down
,
and
call
an
emergency
meeting
,
Bunker
told
him
.
"
In
the
meantime
,
get
the
shop
stewards
at
your
plant
to
take
an
accurate
reading
of
the
majority
viewpoint
without
influencing
the
men
either
way
.
Initially
,
I
want
the
gut
feel
of
the
members
.
We
can
take
final
readings
and
decide
on
an
official
union
line
when
we
know
all
the
facts
.
I
'm
going
to
ask
the
other
plant
conveners
to
do
the
same
.
"
"
OK
,
Clem
,
,
the
convener
said
quickly
.
"
Will
do
.
"
That
evening
,
Bunker
phoned
Peters
at
The
Inn
on
the
Park
to
tell
him
that
he
had
called
an
emergency
meeting
of
plant
conveners
to
help
resolve
the
Merseyside
problem
.
He
was
dismayed
by
the
American
's
response
.
There
was
more
than
a
hint
of
weary
resignation
in
his
reply
.
All
the
old
fighting
spirit
and
enthusiasm
had
gone
.
"
Yeah
.
OK
Clem
.
Thanks
for
ringing
.
and
thanks
for
all
the
effort
that
you
have
put
in
personally
.
Just
sorry
it
has
turned
out
this
way
.
"
He
sounded
like
a
beaten
man
.
News
of
the
strike
made
headlines
in
all
the
British
newspapers
.
It
was
also
given
in-depth
coverage
on
television
and
radio
that
evening
,
with
News
at
Ten
running
it
as
the
lead
story
in
the
first
half
of
the
programme
and
coming
back
to
it
again
in
the
second
.
Clasper
was
interviewed
outside
the
giant
Merseyside
plant
and
predictably
blamed
management
for
deliberately
provoking
the
strike
.
"
Are
you
really
saying
that
the
company
is
to
blame
for
the
strike
?
"
the
man
with
the
microphone
asked
,
thrusting
it
under
Clasper
's
chin
.
"
Well
you
do
n't
think
my
lads
would
be
out
here
just
for
the
bloody
exercise
,
do
you
?
"
Clasper
demanded
sarcastically
.
"
Course
they
're
to
blame
.
Stands
to
reason
.
And
my
lads
are
staying
out
until
Management
reinstates
the
innocent
victim
.
"
And
is
that
the
only
thing
which
would
influence
you
to
call
off
this
strike
,
which
is
obviously
doing
great
harm
to
the
company
and
the
country
?
"
the
interviewer
asked
.
"
Nothing
more
and
nothing
less
,
"
replied
Clasper
.
"
I
'm
already
havin'
to
ask
the
lads
to
exercise
great
restraint
over
this
particular
issue
.
They
want
me
to
insist
that
the
company
sacks
the
foreman
before
they
go
back
,
but
I
've
told
'em
I
wo
n't
be
a
party
to
victimisation
either
way
.
"
"
Thank
you
,
Mr
Clasper
,
"
said
the
interviewer
.
"
Now
back
to
the
studio
.
"
And
there
the
newsreader
told
the
British
people
that
efforts
had
been
made
to
obtain
an
interview
with
the
local
Plant
Manager
,
who
had
declined
to
comment
.
The
President
of
United
Motors
-
who
was
in
London
at
that
moment
-
had
also
declined
to
comment
on
a
local
issue
which
,
he
had
said
was
a
matter
for
local
management
.
The
inference
viewers
gained
was
that
management
was
to
blame
in
one
way
or
another
.
When
he
returned
to
the
States
,
Mueller
lost
no
time
in
carrying
out
Cocello
's
instructions
to
direct
the
phase-out
of
UK
vehicle
operations
from
Detroit
,
and
to
prepare
detail
plans
to
centralise
European
and
world
planning
activities
.
His
first
step
was
to
request
that
all
copies
of
the
European
Vehicle
and
Components
"
Plan
be
withdrawn
from
circulation
.
Having
thus
effectively
stopped
the
Plans
dead
in
their
tracks
,
he
then
proceeded
,
in
the
name
of
the
President
,
to
dry
up
the
outward
flow
of
all
planning
information
from
Detroit
,
so
that
,
from
that
moment
on
,
only
he
and
members
of
the
world
planning
group
would
be
aware
of
what
was
going
on
,
worldwide
,
at
the
planning
stage
.
Mueller
thus
gained
immediate
planning
control
of
world
wide
operations
,
even
before
he
had
formally
received
top
management
approval
to
proceed
.
The
President
had
given
Mueller
an
inch
,
but
he
had
already
taken
a
mile
.
This
tactic
was
not
unusual
in
the
Corporation
.
Mueller
had
simply
used
his
privileged
position
to
advise
the
General
Directors
that
he
was
operating
on
the
instructions
of
the
President
.
He
would
use
that
authority
to
his
own
personal
advantage
.
Mark
Sanders
returned
from
Istanbul
feeling
exhausted
,
depressed
and
ill
.
The
blinding
headaches
he
had
been
experiencing
in
recent
weeks
were
taking
their
toll
,
and
he
looked
grey
and
drawn
when
he
arrived
home
.
Lately
,
Georgina
had
been
worried
by
the
general
deterioration
in
his
appearance
.
But
now
she
was
visibly
shocked
by
the
drained
and
haggard-looking
face
which
kissed
her
.
She
wanted
to
say
,
"
You
look
awful
,
darling
,
"
but
decided
against
it
.
"
What
kind
of
a
trip
have
you
had
?
"
she
asked
instead
.
"
Oh
,
not
too
bad
,
"
he
replied
wearily
.
She
took
his
suitcase
and
placed
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
.
"
Come
into
the
kitchen
,
and
we
will
have
a
cup
of
tea
.
I
've
so
much
news
to
tell
you
.
All
sorts
of
things
seem
to
have
happened
while
you
have
been
away
this
time
.
"
Mark
smiled
thinly
and
kissed
her
affectionately
on
the
cheek
.
"
Tell
me
about
it
,
"
he
replied
.
"
I
could
do
with
a
good
laugh
.
"
"
Why
darling
?
What
's
the
matter
?
Trouble
at
t'mill
?
"
Mark
slipped
an
arm
around
her
slim
waist
as
they
walked
from
the
hall
into
the
kitchen
.
"
Perhaps
it
's
old
Montezuma
's
revenge
,
"
he
replied
.
"
Must
be
getting
too
old
for
this
globe-trotting
lark
,
or
else
my
mis-spent
youth
is
catching
up
on
me
.
I
'm
rapidly
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
young
man
's
game
.
"
"
Nonsense
,
Mark
.
You
're
still
a
young
man
-
well
,
youngish.
"
she
said
,
trying
to
tease
him
out
of
his
apparent
lethargy
and
depression
.
"
Let's
have
that
cup
of
tea
and
you
'll
feel
better
.
"
"
Ah
,
fill
the
cup
,
what
boots
it
to
repeat
,
how
time
is
slipping
underneath
our
feet
,
"
he
quoted
with
a
sigh
.
"
Oh
darling
.
What
a
sad
sack
we
are
today
.
Is
that
how
you
feel
?
Shall
I
accompany
you
on
the
violin
?
Now
let
me
tell
you
all
the
news
.
"
She
poured
the
tea
.
"
Christopher
has
been
promoted
after
only
one
year
.
The
Chairman
of
the
company
told
him
he
was
most
impressed
with
the
contribution
he
's
made
to
the
business
,
and
that
he
could
go
right
to
the
top
if
he
keeps
it
up
.
I
knew
you
'd
be
delighted
to
hear
that
.
"
She
sipped
her
tea
.
"
Next
-
I
've
found
a
super
husband
for
Harriet
.
Champion
of
the
breed
at
Crufts
last
year
.
Lives
in
the
next
village
,
believe
it
or
not
.
Absolutely
magnificent
dog
.
"
"
Lucky
Harriet
,
"
said
Mark
.
"
What
else
?
Ah
yes
;
a
Secretary
at
the
Ministry
of
Industry
wants
you
to
ring
him
.
Seems
they
want
you
to
address
the
European
Commission
on
European
industrial
development
.
In
Dublin
,
I
think
she
said
.
Something
about
the
factors
which
influence
multi-nat
location
decisions
.
Anyway
,
you
'll
know
what
it
means
when
you
see
it
.
I
've
written
it
all
down
.
Oh
and
yes
-
a
chap
from
Conservative
Central
Office
rang
up
to
say
they
'd
like
to
know
if
you
would
be
prepared
to
stand
for
the
European
Parliament
.
He
sounded
somewhat
to
the
right
of
Genghis
Khan
.
I
said
I
did
n't
think
so
,
as
you
were
rather
busy
,
but
I
'd
pass
the
message
on
.
Hope
I
did
the
right
thing
.
I
said
you
never
knew
where
you
were
from
one
week
to
the
next
.
He
said
that
would
do
nicely
.
Just
like
the
American
Express
advertisement
.
Perfect
credentials
apparently
,
for
European
parliamentarians
.
"
Now
what
next
?
The
Chicheley-Smythes
have
bought
an
absolutely
super
villa
in
Sardinia
and
say
we
could
rent
it
if
we
'd
like
to
.
I
've
seen
the
photographs
.
Gorgeous
location
overlooking
a
quiet
bay
.
It
sleeps
ten
with
a
permanent
staff
of
three
.
Only
a
thousand
pounds
a
week
,
yacht
included
.
I
'd
love
that
for
two
or
three
weeks
,
would
n't
you
?
"
"
We
would
n't
want
to
stint
ourselves
,
"
Mark
said
facetiously
,
"
four
or
five
,
I
should
think
-
.
"
"
And
we
could
take
the
family
,
"
she
said
.
"
We
have
n't
had
a
family
holiday
for
years
.
I
'd
like
that
.
But
we
can
talk
about
that
later
.
And
I
've
decided
to
take
up
riding
again
.
Do
n't
ask
me
why
.
Just
got
the
urge
,
that
's
all
.
"
She
gave
him
a
beautiful
smile
,
which
lit
her
lovely
face
.
"
Well
,
how
's
that
for
starters
?
"
she
asked
.
He
had
heard
that
expression
before
.
"
Is
there
more
?
,
"
Now
let
me
see
.
Ah
,
yes
-
Andrew
's
coming
home
for
the
weekend
so
I
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
drinks
party
.
I
've
invited
the
Bunkers
,
if
that
's
all
right
.
I
like
Clem
and
Gwen
and
the
girls
would
be
nicer
company
for
Andrew
.
"
"
Fine
,
"
agreed
Mark
without
much
enthusiasm
.
"
If
Clem
can
make
it
,
that
is
.
I
heard
about
this
latest
Merseyside
strike
in
Istanbul
.
Could
finish
off
the
UK
vehicle
division
,
"
he
said
forlornly
,
"
and
Don
Peters
,
"
he
added
,
shaking
his
head
.
Some
of
the
stupid
bastards
wo
n't
be
satisfied
until
we
no
longer
make
a
single
vehicle
in
the
UK
.
Then
I
suppose
they
'll
say
it
's
all
management
's
fault
,
and
people
will
believe
them
.
And
who
the
hell
IS
management
?
"
he
demanded
,
his
voice
rising
.
"
People
like
me
,
who
've
worked
their
guts
out
to
expand
the
business
while
the
militant
bastards
have
been
working
their
guts
out
to
destroy
it
.
"
Georgina
was
nodding
agreement
.
She
patted
his
wrist
.
"
I
'm
quite
sure
you
're
right
,
dear
.
But
we
were
n't
talking
about
the
motor
industry
and
the
never-ending
management-union
saga
.
We
were
talking
about
Andrew
coming
home
for
the
weekend
and
having
the
Bunkers
round
for
drinks
.
And
I
do
wish
you
would
n't
swear
like
that
when
you
talk
about
business
.
You
never
used
to
swear
,
you
know
.
At
least
,
you
did
n't
when
you
were
with
me
.
But
you
do
now
,
darling
,
and
I
do
wish
you
would
n't
.
You
are
becoming
so
hard
and
bitter
and
it
's
not
really
like
you
.
"
Mark
sighed
.
"
I
'm
sorry
.
It
's
just
-
.
"
"
It
's
just
that
there
really
is
trouble
at
t'mill
,
"
she
said
quietly
.
"
That
's
it
,
is
n't
it
?
You
were
n't
going
to
tell
me
.
You
were
just
going
to
worry
about
it
alone
.
You
let
me
go
rabitting
on
-
.
He
hugged
her
;
kissed
her
cheek
.
"
I
'm
not
sure
yet
that
there
really
is
something
to
worry
about
.
"
"
But
you
think
there
is
.
"
He
nodded
.
"
I
have
a
horrible
feeling
that
UM
is
about
to
reorganise
world-wide
planning
operations
and
,
if
that
happens
,
it
's
curtains
for
the
European
organisation
and
for
me
.
"
"
Curtains
?
"
she
said
.
"
What
exactly
would
that
mean
?
"
"
Early
retirement
.
"
"
Mark
,
you
're
not
serious
!
,
"
I
think
it
could
be
on
the
cards
.
They
could
transfer
me
to
Detroit
,
or
somewhere
.
I
do
n't
know
,
but
I
do
n't
like
the
signs
.
"
"
Oh
,
Mark
,
"
she
said
.
"
They
would
n't
do
that
to
you
.
They
just
could
n't
.
Not
after
all
you
've
done
for
the
Corporation
.
They
could
n't
be
that
unfair
and
ruthless
.
"
His
expression
was
wry
.
"
My
dear
,
they
'll
do
whatever
they
feel
is
necessary
to
do
.
Sentiment
,
loyalty
,
service
and
track
record
,
none
of
these
things
will
come
into
it
.
"
Georgina
took
him
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
on
the
lips
.
"
It
's
all
so
ridiculous
that
we
're
not
going
to
even
think
about
it
any
more
,
"
she
said
firmly
,
hiding
her
fears
.
"
Now
come
into
the
garden
,
"
she
added
,
smiling
.
"
I
want
to
show
you
the
clematis
.
It
's
a
mass
of
colour
.
"
Lying
in
bed
that
evening
,
they
talked
a
lot
about
their
life
together
.
They
recalled
their
first
days
.
The
county
ball
.
The
Paul
Jones
and
the
emotional
somersaults
when
the
music
stopped
and
they
came
face
to
face
for
the
very
first
time
.
The
wedding
.
The
birth
of
their
first
son
,
Adam
,
and
then
Christopher
and
Andrew
.
The
children
growing
up
with
all
the
laughter
and
tears
.
Schooldays
and
the
void
they
both
felt
when
the
boys
went
off
to
boarding
school
,
followed
by
the
joy
unconfined
when
they
came
home
at
the
end
of
term
.
Mark
's
promotions
and
progress
up
the
company
ladder
.
New
and
changing
homes
.
Friends
lost
and
friends
gained
.
Family
achievements
and
disappointments
.
Notwithstanding
current
problems
which
they
discussed
lightly
,
it
had
all
been
wonderful
.
They
fell
asleep
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
,
holding
hands
.
The
next
day
Mark
arrived
back
at
UM
's
European
headquarters
in
London
and
received
an
early
call
from
Muldoon
.
He
went
down
the
airless
corridor
to
his
Boss
's
office
,
said
hello
to
the
secretary
,
and
walked
into
the
large
oak-panelled
room
which
was
as
big
as
the
lobby
of
many
a
sizeable
hotel
.
Muldoon
rose
immediately
from
his
enormous
black
leather
chair
to
greet
him
,
coming
from
behind
the
vast
desk
with
hand
outstretched
.
"
Hello
Mark
.
Have
a
good
trip
?
"
He
took
the
Englishman
by
the
arm
and
ushered
him
toward
the
easy
chairs
arranged
around
a
long
rectangular
coffee
table
.
Instinctively
,
Mark
felt
uneasy
.
Why
the
hand
on
the
arm
and
the
over-friendly
approach
?
Muldoon
never
emerged
from
behind
his
desk
to
greet
colleagues
.
Only
visitors
and
VIPs
got
that
special
reception
.
Muldoon
poured
the
coffee
.
"
How
did
the
Planning
meeting
go
?
"
Mark
asked
him
.
"
What
was
Nate
's
reaction
?
Did
he
and
the
Committee
go
along
with
my
proposals
?
"
he
added
.
"
It
went
fine
,
"
Muldoon
said
.
He
seemed
somewhat
uneasy
.
"
Klepner
did
a
good
job
.
"
"
How
did
he
handle
the
questions
?
"
Mark
asked
.
"
He
does
n't
have
the
inside
knowledge
to
deal
with
questions
.
"
"
Oh
,
OK
really
.
I
handled
some
and
so
did
Mueller
.
But
Klepner
did
OK
.
He
did
n't
let
the
side
down
.
"
Mark
nodded
.
"
What
was
Mueller
doing
answering
questions
.
He
was
there
to
ASK
them
.
He
does
n't
know
the
inside
track
any
more
than
Klepner
.
"
"
Maybe
not
,
but
he
soon
will
,
"
Muldoon
replied
quietly
.
"
And
what
does
that
mean
?
"
Muldoon
seemed
to
be
taking
a
long
time
over
his
coffee
.
He
evaded
Mark
's
eyes
.
"
He
's
goin'
to
head-up
world
planning
operations
from
Detroit
.
"
"
He
's
already
co-ordinating
the
regional
plans
to
provide
a
world
picture
.
So
what
's
changed
?
"
Deep
down
he
knew
.
"
He
's
not
going
to
just
co-ordinate
and
consolidate
any
longer
,
"
Muldoon
said
,
with
increasing
nervousness
.
"
He
's
gon
na
plan
,
direct
and
control
worldwide
planning
operations
from
Detroit
,
including
the
regional
planning
functions
.
"
Mark
's
expression
was
one
of
faked
incredulity
.
His
gut
feelings
had
been
right
.
"
You
've
got
to
be
joking
!
"
he
scoffed
.
"
I
know
that
's
what
Mueller
's
always
wanted
,
but
Nate
and
the
Executive
Committee
would
never
fall
for
that
bloody
empire-building
game
!
The
regions
are
far
too
big
and
complex
to
be
handled
from
Detroit
and
even
if
they
were
foolish
enough
to
believe
that
they
could
do
it
more
effectively
-
which
they
ca
n't
-
they
would
be
crazy
to
try
.
"
"
I
know
,
Mark
,
I
know
,
"
Muldoon
said
.
"
But
that
's
what
they
're
gon
na
do
.
"
"
It
will
boomerang
,
"
the
Englishman
said
heatedly
.
"
Overseas
Governments
and
local
nationals
just
wo
n't
stand
for
it
,
particularly
when
they
get
to
know
what
's
going
on
.
That
's
one
corporate
plan
that
ca
n't
win
,
not
in
the
long
term
.
"
I
know
,
Mark
.
But
they
think
they
can
run
everything
from
Detroit
and
that
's
the
way
the
organisation
is
going
to
be
restructured
.
They
are
working
on
it
right
now
.
We
will
know
the
details
in
a
few
weeks
"
time
.
Couple
of
months
at
the
latest
.
"
Mark
said
quietly
:
"
And
how
does
that
affect
the
European
organisation
?
"
The
organisation
will
be
wound
up
.
I
'm
taking
early
retirement
.
"
"
And
me
?
"
Muldoon
shrugged
.
"
Not
certain
yet
.
But
my
guess
is
early
retirement
too
,
unless
you
're
prepared
to
go
back
to
divisional
work
.
Local
MD
perhaps
?
"
The
Englishman
snorted
.
"
You
know
I
ca
n't
go
back
.
Who
the
hell
can
?
In
any
case
,
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
the
MDs
are
always
American
.
"
"
Well
,
there
wo
n't
be
any
European
job
functions
,
that
's
for
sure
,
"
Muldoon
said
.
"
There
'll
be
a
direct
link
between
Detroit
and
the
line
managers
in
each
country
,
with
Detroit
calling
the
shots
.
"
"
Do
n't
they
realise
they
're
playing
with
political
dynamite
?
Mark
demanded
.
"
Mueller
wo
n't
give
a
damn
about
the
effect
of
a
corporate
plan
on
Europe
and
on
individual
countries
.
If
he
wants
to
import
vehicles
or
components
from
Taiwan
or
Singapore
or
Hong
Kong
into
Europe
,
he
'll
go
ahead
and
do
it
,
regardless
of
the
economic
consequences
for
the
European
countries
concerned
.
The
only
thing
you
can
be
sure
of
is
that
US
interest
will
always
come
first
.
Oh
,
and
there
's
one
more
thing
you
can
be
sure
of
,
"
he
added
sourly
.
"
They
wo
n't
plan
to
supply
the
US
market
from
imports
.
You
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
on
that
!
Jesus
wept
!
"
he
continued
,
hackles
rising
.
"
Mueller
will
have
the
power
to
make
or
break
whole
areas
of
Europe
.
He
's
the
last
guy
in
the
world
who
should
be
given
such
power
.
The
bloody
man
's
power
drunk
already
.
"
He
was
angry
and
bitter
.
"
I
know
,
"
Muldoon
agreed
sadly
.
"
Then
what
are
you
and
Clancy
doing
about
it
?
"
"
Look
,
Mark
,
"
Muldoon
said
forlornly
"
What
's
the
point
?
The
wheels
have
already
been
set
in
motion
.
We
're
not
gon
na
change
anyone
's
mind
.
You
know
that
.
"
His
tone
was
abject
.
"
Sorry
you
're
takin'
it
so
bad
,
"
he
added
miserably
.
"
How
else
should
I
take
it
?
"
Mark
demanded
.
"
It
's
my
life
which
is
about
to
go
down
the
plughole
.
I
'm
not
an
American
on
a
brief
overseas
assignment
.
I
've
spent
my
entire
working
life
in
the
European
components
"
business
.
I
've
grown
up
in
it
.
It
's
in
my
blood
.
I
've
built
plants
and
managed
them
.
Designed
products
and
marketed
and
sold
them
.
When
I
was
an
apprentice
there
were
two
component
plants
in
Europe
,
and
now
there
are
seventeen
,
and
I
've
had
a
hand
in
establishing
the
last
twelve
.
What
the
hell
do
you
expect
me
to
say
?
Oh
,
is
that
what
they
are
proposing
to
do
?
Well
bully
for
Mueller
and
the
Corporation
?
I
'll
go
and
collect
my
hat
and
coat
!
"
"
I
know
how
you
feel
,
Mark
,
"
Muldoon
said
sadly
.
"
Do
you
,
Pat
?
Do
you
?
You
're
sixty-one
and
have
been
looking
forward
to
retirement
.
I
'm
fifty
and
have
a
long
way
to
go
.
I
do
n't
think
you
can
see
things
the
way
I
see
them
.
"
Well
,
perhaps
not
,
"
Muldoon
agreed
.
"
But
I
can
understand
how
you
feel
.
"
The
Englishman
nodded
and
poured
himself
more
coffee
.
"
So
what
's
going
to
happen
to
the
European
Plan
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Mueller
will
drive
it
from
Detroit
,
with
one
or
two
amendments
agreed
at
the
EPC
meeting
,
"
Muldoon
told
him
.
"
What
amendments
?
"
"
No
further
plant
investment
in
the
UK
.
"
"
I
suppose
Mueller
saw
to
that
,
"
Mark
said
sarcastically
.
"
He
really
hates
our
guts
!
God
help
the
British
plants
under
the
new
regime
!
"
Muldoon
shook
his
head
.
"
No
,
it
was
n't
that
.
It
was
the
strike
at
Merseyside
.
That
was
the
last
straw
as
far
as
Nate
was
concerned
.
Up
until
that
news
hit
the
Committee
,
Don
had
won
the
day
with
his
UK
Vehicle
Division
proposals
.
But
as
soon
as
Nate
heard
about
the
latest
strike
,
that
was
it
.
End
of
story
.
He
instructed
Mueller
to
phase-out
vehicle
manufacture
in
the
UK
.
"
Mark
nodded
.
"
How
did
Don
take
it
?
He
was
beginning
to
win
through
.
"
"
He
's
very
upset
.
Naturally
.
It
's
the
first
time
in
his
career
he
has
n't
come
out
on
top
.
Mueller
is
taking
over
the
plan
,
and
Don
is
being
transferred
back
to
the
States
.
Public
relations
job
or
something
similar
.
Just
think
of
it
,
a
man
of
his
talent
and
ability
stooging
around
the
media
.
"
"
So
when
's
he
going
back
to
the
States
?
"
Mark
said
.
"
It
wo
n't
be
announced
for
a
week
or
so
,
but
he
's
already
been
told
.
He
'll
fly
out
inside
the
month
.
"
"
And
what
do
you
and
I
do
now
?
Mark
enquired
.
"
Start
emptying
the
files
?
"
Muldoon
made
a
face
.
"
Afraid
so
.
Klepner
will
take
over
the
files
and
ship
them
back
to
the
States
.
He
'll
be
Mueller
's
European
components
"
Planning
Manager
in
Detroit
.
"
"
Klepner
?
"
Mark
uttered
in
mock
astonishment
.
"
The
man
knows
nothing
about
Europe
.
He
's
a
novice
.
A
bloody
charlatan
!
"
"
I
know
it
sounds
crazy
,
Mark
,
"
Muldoon
said
.
"
But
there
it
is
.
We
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
.
I
was
instructed
to
tell
you
,
and
I
have
.
New
York
and
Detroit
will
come
up
with
an
attractive
separation
package
,
you
can
be
sure
of
that
.
They
've
already
told
me
you
'll
get
the
maximum
terms
permitted
under
British
law
.
The
Corporation
wants
to
do
the
right
thing
by
you
.
"
The
two
men
rose
from
the
table
together
.
"
Sure
.
We
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
,
"
said
the
Englishman
.
"
There
has
to
be
losers
as
well
as
winners
,
,
said
the
American
.
"
I
guess
we
're
both
losers
,
Mark
.
"
The
Englishman
returned
to
his
own
palatial
office
and
sat
with
his
head
in
hands
.
Another
of
his
blinding
headaches
had
developed
and
he
felt
a
tight
sensation
in
his
chest
,
which
made
breathing
very
painful
and
difficult
.
His
secretary
entered
the
room
.
Can
I
get
you
a
coffee
,
Mr
Sanders
?
You
do
n't
look
at
all
well
.
Shall
I
get
the
doctor
?
"
He
looked
up
and
smiled
.
"
No
thank
you
Millie
.
I
'm
all
right
.
Just
a
headache
.
Be
OK
in
a
minute
.
Would
love
a
cup
of
coffee
though
.
"
Are
you
sure
I
should
n't
get
a
doctor
?
"
she
asked
.
"
No
thank
you
.
I
'll
be
OK
.
It
's
only
a
headache
.
"
Millie
had
her
reasons
for
being
concerned
.
The
petticoat
Mafia
at
the
top
of
the
organisation
always
knew
what
was
going
on
,
often
before
the
top
executives
themselves
.
Millie
and
the
secretaries
of
Pat
Muldoon
and
Clancy
McGillicuddy
were
all
close
friends
.
They
had
got
together
over
the
weekend
to
discuss
the
implications
of
the
confidential
letter
the
two
Americans
had
received
from
Randy
Mueller
on
behalf
of
Nate
Cocello
.
Major
changes
were
afoot
which
affected
their
respective
bosses
.
By
the
time
Mark
reached
home
that
evening
,
the
pains
in
his
head
were
excruciating
.
He
decided
against
telling
Georgina
about
his
meeting
with
Muldoon
.
He
would
wait
for
the
right
moment
.
This
was
n't
it
.
Mark
had
a
very
full
fortnight
ahead
,
for
which
he
was
grateful
.
It
gave
him
little
time
to
think
of
his
own
problems
.
First
,
there
was
a
meeting
in
Whitehall
of
the
Economic
Planning
Council
,
followed
by
the
conference
at
Trinity
College
Dublin
,
at
which
he
had
been
invited
to
speak
on
the
subject
of
European
investment
.
He
had
accepted
the
invitation
gladly
,
knowing
full
well
that
it
would
be
his
last
opportunity
to
speak
in
public
as
a
European
executive
of
United
Motors
.
He
hoped
to
make
it
a
fitting
swan-song
.
At
the
Economic
Planning
Council
he
had
expected
to
see
Clem
Bunker
,
but
he
was
absent
,
holding
his
own
meeting
with
the
vehicle
plant
conveners
in
an
attempt
to
determine
the
truth
about
the
sacking
incident
and
to
resolve
the
dispute
.
What
he
did
n't
know
,
could
n't
know
,
was
that
nothing
he
could
now
do
would
make
any
difference
.
There
had
been
trouble
on
Merseyside
just
once
too
often
,
and
muddleheaded
militants
who
believed
that
revolution
was
spawned
in
deprivation
and
poverty
would
be
able
to
hold
a
little
holiday
in
their
hearts
,
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
several
more
thousand
British
workers
had
been
gulled
into
inflicting
poverty
and
deprivation
upon
themselves
.
Opening
the
meeting
of
the
Economic
Planning
Council
,
the
Chairman
,
Lord
Hampshire
,
surprised
members
by
announcing
that
the
Prime
Minister
intended
to
sit
in
on
the
transport
debate
,
which
was
the
subject
of
a
White
Paper
about
to
be
discussed
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
As
this
was
the
first
item
on
the
agenda
,
the
Prime
Minister
made
her
appearance
at
ten
thirty-three
,
immediately
after
the
Chairman
had
made
his
announcement
.
After
the
usual
preliminaries
and
courtesies
from
the
Chair
,
the
Minister
of
Transport
outlined
the
Government
's
proposals
before
the
Chairman
threw
the
subject
open
for
discussion
.
But
,
before
doing
so
,
he
asked
the
Prime
Minister
if
she
wished
to
say
a
few
words
.
The
"
Iron
Lady
"
as
she
was
called
,
smiled
the
steely
smile
which
was
so
familiar
on
the
television
screen
and
in
the
press
.
"
I
am
here
to
listen
and
learn
,
my
Lord
Chairman
,
"
she
said
in
her
clear
and
authoritative
voice
.
"
But
I
am
particularly
interested
to
know
if
the
United
Kingdom
incurs
a
significant
transportation
cost
penalty
on
its
exports
to
Europe
which
puts
this
country
at
a
commercial
and
economic
disadvantage
to
the
rest
of
the
Community
.
I
am
also
keen
to
know
,
"
she
continued
,
"
if
any
such
cost
penalties
operate
to
our
disadvantage
when
European
investment
decisions
are
made
,
in
particular
those
international
mobile
investment
decisions
which
are
made
by
the
multinationals
.
I
understand
that
Mr
Sanders
has
accepted
an
invitation
to
address
the
European
Commission
on
the
subject
in
Dublin
,
and
I
look
forward
to
hearing
his
observations
.
"
Lord
Hampshire
had
folded
a
piece
of
paper
which
was
being
passed
around
the
table
.
It
arrived
in
front
of
Mark
with
his
name
on
it
.
He
unfolded
the
paper
.
"
Do
n't
put
your
pads
on
,
just
yet
,
"
it
said
.
"
Want
you
to
come
in
lower
down
the
batting
order
.
"
It
was
signed
"
H
"
.
The
Chairman
of
the
National
Docks
'
Authority
opened
the
batting
by
reviewing
plans
to
meet
the
ever-growing
volume
of
docks
'
traffic
,
particularly
the
substantial
growth
in
roll-on
,
roll-off
between
Britain
and
the
continent
.
The
Chief
Highways
Planner
followed
,
outlining
the
Government
's
intentions
to
provide
further
motorway
links
between
industrial
centres
and
the
ports
.
He
also
described
the
various
channel
tunnel
options
currently
being
studied
by
the
Ministry
.
The
rail
,
airways
and
waterways
chiefs
then
outlined
their
plans
,
before
the
Chairman
threw
the
subject
open
to
the
Council
members
.
Several
members
then
questioned
the
planning
assumption
of
the
Chief
Planning
Officers
,
making
pertinent
observations
based
on
their
own
particular
knowledge
and
experience
.
Mark
Sanders
was
called
by
the
Chairman
after
an
hour
's
discussion
.
"
Now
let's
have
a
multi-national
view
point
,
"
he
said
cheerfully
.
"
Particularly
on
the
points
raised
by
the
Prime
Minister
.
Mark
would
you
like
to
face
the
next
ball
?
"
Mark
smiled
and
nodded
.
"
Before
we
begin
,
Mr
Sanders
,
"
the
Prime
Minister
said
,
warmly
,
"
will
you
tell
me
which
hat
you
will
be
wearing
today
?
Your
European
hat
,
or
the
British
one
?
"
she
smiled
a
thin
smile
.
The
Chairman
smiled
.
Mark
smiled
.
Everyone
smiled
.
"
Whichever
one
you
wish
me
to
wear
,
Prime
Minister
,
"
he
replied
.
"
Can
we
see
you
in
both
?
"
she
rejoined
.
"
Then
we
can
judge
which
one
we
prefer
.
"
"
I
'm
afraid
I
do
n't
look
particularly
good
in
either
,
"
Mark
said
,
"
but
,
putting
on
my
British
hat
first
:
yes
,
Prime
Minister
,
the
United
Kingdom
is
at
a
considerable
disadvantage
when
multi-nationals
consider
investment
locations
in
Europe
.
The
transport
cost
penalty
,
to
which
you
referred
,
varies
of
course
with
the
nature
of
the
product
being
manufactured
,
and
ranges
from
two
per
cent
to
twenty
per
cent
in
the
motor
industry
.
"
"
So
why
is
it
called
a
penalty
?
"
the
Prime
Minister
asked
.
"
That
's
right
,
is
n't
it
?
Transport
cost
penalty
?
"
she
added
with
a
pained
expression
.
"
Yes
,
Prime
Minister
.
"
"
But
why
?
Surely
the
expression
suggests
that
we
are
being
penalised
into
paying
more
than
our
EEC
partners
.
How
can
this
be
?
We
ship
exports
to
Europe
and
it
costs
X
pounds
.
Our
partners
in
the
EEC
ship
their
exports
to
us
,
and
again
it
costs
the
same
X
pounds
.
So
where
does
the
penalty
come
in
?
"
It
comes
in
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
when
you
consider
exports
as
a
proportion
of
total
output
.
A
European
plant
will
probably
sell
around
four
fifths
of
its
total
output
on
the
European
mainland
,
principally
within
the
so-called
Golden
Triangle
countries
of
West
Germany
,
France
,
Belgium
and
Holland
at
the
centre
of
the
market
.
The
remaining
one
fifth
of
output
will
be
exported
to
the
long-distance
peripheral
markets
of
the
United
Kingdom
and
Italy
,
etcetera
,
so
when
you
export
from
a
UK
manufacturing
base
you
ship
four
fifths
of
the
output
over
relatively
longer
distances
,
hence
the
UK
transport
cost
penalty
.
"
The
Prime
Minister
was
nodding
agreement
long
before
Mark
had
finished
.
"
Yes
,
I
see
.
But
does
n't
that
mean
that
most
of
the
European
investment
will
always
tend
to
go
to
the
centrally
placed
Golden
Triangle
countries
who
occupy
this
privileged
position
rather
than
to
the
United
Kingdom
and
other
peripheral
countries
who
are
in
less
favoured
areas
?
"
Yes
,
it
does
mean
just
that
,
"
Mark
said
.
"
But
such
a
situation
simply
strengthens
the
strong
,
and
weakens
the
weak
,
does
n't
it
?
"
the
Prime
Minister
said
,
eyebrows
raised
.
"
How
does
a
large
industrial
country
,
such
as
the
UK
rebuild
and
expand
its
industrial
base
,
and
correct
a
worsening
balance
of
trade
in
manufactured
products
,
if
investment
location
decisions
by
the
multi-nationals
go
against
it
on
such
grounds
?
,
"
I
am
afraid
,
Prime
Minister
,
the
answer
is
that
we
have
to
be
more
efficient
than
our
European
competitors
.
"
Mark
answered
in
a
matter
of
fact
voice
.
Transport
costs
do
impose
a
penalty
.
We
've
got
to
live
with
it
.
And
beat
it
.
We
've
got
to
absorb
these
costs
by
being
super-efficient
.
"
Again
the
Prime
Minister
was
nodding
her
agreement
.
"
But
,
"
Mark
continued
,
transport
costs
are
only
one
of
the
factors
which
have
placed
British
industry
at
a
disadvantage
in
recent
years
.
"
"
And
what
are
the
others
,
Mr
Sanders
?
"
"
If
you
'll
forgive
me
saying
so
,
Prime
Minister
,
"
Mark
replied
cautiously
,
"
successive
British
Governments
and
the
trade
unions
have
n't
exactly
helped
.
"
The
steely
smile
was
glimpsed
briefly
.
"
I
think
that
's
something
you
are
really
going
to
have
to
explain
,
Mr
Sanders
,
"
she
said
quizzically
in
a
pained
expression
.
"
If
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
,
Prime
Minister
,
"
he
continued
,
"
Britain
has
consistently
lost
out
because
-
.
"
He
had
been
speaking
for
some
five
minutes
or
more
with
force
and
conviction
,
carried
away
by
the
things
which
concerned
him
greatly
.
Now
,
suddenly
,
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
he
had
allowed
himself
to
go
a
little
"
over
the
top
"
.
At
these
meetings
viewpoints
were
expressed
in
a
suitably
detached
manner
.
"
I
'm
afraid
I
've
gone
on
a
bit
,
My
Lord
Chairman
,
"
he
said
apologetically
.
"
I
think
I
've
said
enough
.
Probably
too
much
.
"
"
Not
at
all
,
"
put
in
the
Prime
Minister
,
reassuringly
.
"
It
's
only
when
you
let
your
hair
down
that
others
can
see
the
real
person
hiding
under
the
hat
.
I
personally
have
found
your
candour
very
refreshing
.
It
's
such
a
change
to
hear
someone
say
what
he
really
believes
-
.
"
and
a
warm
smile
blazed
.
"
Almost
never
happens
in
politics
.
"
The
laughter
was
general
.
"
Now
Mr
Sanders
,
"
she
continued
,
"
can
we
ask
you
to
wear
your
European
hat
?
Spain
and
Austria
are
peripheral
countries
are
n't
they
?
So
why
is
it
that
your
company
,
and
certain
other
major
multi-nationals
,
plan
to
invest
heavily
in
those
countries
?
,
She
cocked
her
head
to
one
side
after
she
had
posed
the
question
.
"
Spain
erects
huge
barriers
which
make
it
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
for
vehicle
and
component
imports
to
enter
that
country
,
"
Mark
said
.
"
So
if
my
company
wishes
to
supply
the
domestic
market
of
this
large
and
expanding
population
,
it
has
no
alternative
but
to
manufacture
from
within
the
country
itself
.
Spanish
rules
and
regulations
then
determine
what
percentage
of
total
output
will
be
exported
and
what
the
local
component
content
will
be
.
"
Similarly
,
the
Austrian
Government
has
made
it
clear
that
unless
multi-nationals
manufacture
vehicles
or
components
within
the
country
to
correct
its
trade
deficit
,
then
it
will
be
obliged
to
take
appropriate
steps
to
close
its
domestic
markets
to
their
products
.
"
The
Prime
Minister
clasped
her
hands
together
.
"
How
very
interesting
.
And
pray
do
tell
me
which
countries
will
have
to
accept
the
exports
of
motor
vehicles
or
components
from
Spain
,
say
,
as
a
result
of
anything
which
might
be
agreed
between
United
Motors
and
the
Spanish
Government
?
"
As
Mark
began
to
reply
,
she
said
the
first
name
with
him
,
nodding
her
head
the
while
.
"
Great
Britain
-
of
course
,
of
course
.
And
is
that
free
and
fair
European
trade
,
Mr
Sanders
?
"
She
asked
with
more
than
a
hint
of
sarcasm
in
her
voice
.
"
My
company
does
n't
make
Government
rules
and
regulations
,
Prime
Minister
,
"
he
replied
.
"
We
comply
with
them
or
we
are
excluded
from
these
markets
.
"
"
Quite
so
.
But
would
you
accept
that
such
discriminatory
rules
and
regulations
operate
to
this
country
's
clear
disadvantage
?
"
"
Of
course
,
"
Mark
agreed
.
"
Without
question
.
"
The
first
lady
nodded
and
went
on
nodding
for
several
seconds
in
quiet
contemplation
before
putting
two
further
questions
to
him
concerning
European
regional
incentives
,
Government
grants
and
subsidies
and
their
cost
distorting
influence
on
investment
location
decisions
.
Mark
answered
in
the
traditional
matter-of-fact
manner
,
parading
all
the
relevant
factors
and
letting
the
facts
speak
for
themselves
.
The
Prime
Minister
departed
a
short
time
later
with
the
Ministers
of
Transport
and
Energy
escorted
by
Lord
Hampshire
.
In
all
,
she
had
spent
ninety
minutes
at
the
meeting
.
During
the
lunch
break
,
the
Chairman
took
Mark
to
one
side
.
"
Before
she
left
,
the
PM
told
me
how
pleased
she
was
that
you
were
so
frank
.
And
she
's
delighted
that
you
have
accepted
the
invitation
to
address
the
European
Commission
on
the
subject
in
Dublin
.
She
's
looking
for
ways
and
means
of
redressing
Britain
's
excessive
contribution
to
the
European
budget
which
,
as
you
know
,
is
the
highest
in
the
community
.
She
believes
that
with
your
practical
experience
at
the
sharp
end
in
Europe
you
will
be
able
to
provide
much
needed
ammunition
to
support
her
appeal
which
is
to
be
submitted
to
the
Commission
and
the
Council
of
Ministers
.
The
next
day
,
Mark
told
Millie
,
his
secretary
,
that
the
Corporation
's
plans
for
reorganisation
would
involve
the
elimination
of
regional
management
.
She
had
been
expecting
the
news
,
because
of
her
privileged
position
in
the
"
Petticoat
Mafia
"
but
it
none-the-less
visibly
upset
her
.
She
had
what
was
generally
regarded
by
other
top
secretaries
as
the
most
interesting
job
in
European
component
operations
,
and
took
a
great
personal
interest
in
her
work
.
As
a
long-service
employee
she
knew
from
first-hand
experience
the
contribution
Mark
had
made
to
the
expansion
of
the
Corporation
over
the
years
.
"
It
is
n't
fair
!
"
she
exclaimed
angrily
.
"
Fair
or
not
,
"
Mark
said
,
trying
to
speak
lightly
,
"
it
's
what
's
going
to
happen
.
The
parting
of
the
ways
,
I
'm
afraid
,
after
all
these
years
.
But
do
n't
worry
.
It
has
already
been
agreed
that
you
'll
be
offered
another
position
within
the
Corporation
at
the
same
salary
.
"
The
classically
attractive
forty-year-old
secretary
smiled
uncertainly
.
Her
eyes
brimmed
.
"
I
'm
not
really
concerned
about
myself
.
It
's
so
heartless
and
unfair
after
all
you
've
done
.
"
"
That
,
as
the
Americans
say
,
"
Mark
told
her
wryly
,
"
is
how
the
cookie
crumbles
.
I
suppose
I
'm
going
to
miss
the
old
firm
after
all
these
years
.
And
I
'm
going
to
miss
you
too
,
"
he
added
with
a
smile
.
"
We
've
worked
together
for
a
very
long
time
.
"
She
blinked
and
touched
the
corners
of
her
eyes
.
"
Certainly
have
.
"
"
I
've
really
enjoyed
working
with
you
,
Millie
.
Thank
you
,
"
Mark
said
with
sincerity
.
"
And
I
've
enjoyed
working
with
you
too
.
I
really
have
,
"
she
blurted
,
and
hurried
from
the
room
into
her
own
adjacent
office
.
And
there
,
privately
,
she
cried
.
It
was
a
demoralised
Don
Peters
who
drove
away
from
The
London
Hilton
and
the
all-American
farewell
party
that
had
been
laid
on
for
him
by
Clancy
McGillicuddy
.
In
response
to
the
many
toasts
from
his
American
colleagues
he
had
made
a
light-hearted
speech
at
dinner
,
which
belied
his
deep
disappointment
at
being
sent
back
to
the
States
on
a
Public
Relations
assignment
.
Sure
,
the
newly
created
position
with
its
impressive
job
title
sounded
important
,
but
that
was
only
to
impress
the
media
and
the
public
.
It
impressed
no-one
at
corporate
management
level
.
Don
Peters
had
failed
in
his
UK
assignment
and
had
effectively
blown
his
chances
of
being
moved
further
up
the
corporate
ladder
to
a
Vice
Presidency
and
,
maybe
,
to
the
Presidency
itself
.
He
turned
the
car
into
Park
Lane
and
drove
quickly
and
skilfully
through
the
maze
of
traffic
converging
on
Marble
Arch
to
emerge
in
the
correct
lane
for
the
Edgware
Road
.
By
his
side
,
the
magnificent
cosmetically-engineered
Eleanor
graphically
expressed
what
she
thought
of
the
farewell
party
through
blazing
eyes
which
darted
alarmingly
under
false
eyelashes
.
She
was
n't
demoralised
.
She
was
absolutely
livid
.
"
Do
n't
you
ever
put
me
through
that
situation
again
,
"
she
snarled
through
clenched
teeth
,
tugging
irritably
at
the
sleeve
of
her
mink
jacket
.
"
I
've
never
been
so
uncomfortable
in
all
my
life
.
It
was
utter
humiliation
.
"
"
Aw
,
come
on
now
honey
-
it
was
n't
that
bad
,
"
he
replied
dismally
,
pulling
over
to
allow
a
wailing
police
car
through
the
heavy
late
night
traffic
.
"
Huh
,
"
she
scoffed
dismissively
.
"
Who
's
kiddin'
who
?
It
was
sheer
bloody
hell
listening
to
all
those
fatuous
nincompoops
saying
what
a
great
guy
you
are
.
Bullshit
!
Sure
you
're
a
great
guy
in
their
eyes
-
you
've
done
'em
all
a
favour
by
writing
yourself
off
the
promotion
list
.
Jeez
,
they
could
n't
conceal
how
pleased
they
were
.
It
made
me
want
to
throw
up
!
"
He
screwed
up
his
eyes
with
pain
.
She
was
right
of
course
,
he
knew
that
,
but
her
words
hurt
just
the
same
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
career
he
had
failed
to
produce
the
goods
and
that
hurt
his
pride
.
He
was
also
finished
as
a
rising
executive
.
He
had
been
shunted
into
a
side-line
and
was
now
out
of
the
mainstream
traffic
for
good
.
He
knew
that
.
Trance-like
he
drove
down
the
Edgware
Road
,
responding
to
the
multitudinous
traffic
lights
with
mechanical
movements
,
while
the
agitated
Eleanor
continued
to
lash
his
unreceptive
ear
with
a
never-ending
stream
of
abuse
.
He
reflected
on
the
options
which
had
been
open
to
him
,
one
of
which
had
led
to
his
downfall
.
Eleanor
was
right
when
she
had
said
at
the
very
beginning
that
he
should
have
gone
along
with
the
corporate
planning
proposals
to
phase-out
the
UK
Vehicle
Division
as
a
manufacturing
operation
.
He
would
have
survived
if
he
had
accepted
the
plan
in
the
first
place
and
done
what
the
Corporation
had
wanted
him
to
do
instead
of
putting
forward
his
own
counter
proposals
.
But
that
was
easier
said
than
done
.
How
could
he
have
accepted
such
a
proposal
without
letting
down
the
fifty
thousand
people
who
worked
for
him
?
He
was
their
leader
.
If
he
did
n't
fight
on
their
behalf
,
who
the
hell
would
?
He
switched
on
the
headlights
as
the
car
entered
the
M1
at
Brent
Cross
.
Eleanor
's
waspish
voice
ranted
on
and
on
.
"
You
should
have
seen
the
smug
self
satisfaction
on
the
faces
of
those
bitches
as
they
lined
up
to
kiss
me
,
"
she
rasped
.
"
So
sorry
,
darling
"
,
"
she
mimicked
.
"
We
're
really
goin'
to
miss
you
both
,
we
really
are
-
.
"
The
lousy
hypocritical
bastards
!
I
could
have
spit
in
their
eyes
!
"
She
swung
her
head
in
his
direction
.
"
Well
for
God
's
sake
say
something
,
"
she
yelled
.
"
Even
if
it
's
only
"
Goodbye
"
.
Do
n't
you
have
any
feelings
for
what
I
'm
goin'
through
?
"
"
Waal
,
I
do
n't
exactly
feel
too
good
myself
,
"
he
replied
morosely
.
"
Then
,
why
did
you
do
it
?
"
she
cried
bitterly
.
"
I
said
you
were
crazy
not
to
go
along
with
the
Corporation
's
proposals
,
did
n't
I
?
But
you
would
n't
listen
to
me
.
Oh
no
!
Not
you
,
you
had
to
be
the
good
guy
.
You
had
to
do
a
Custer
.
Well
,
look
where
it
's
got
you
.
And
do
you
think
for
one
minute
they
care
a
damn
about
you
?
You
've
got
to
be
joking
.
And
what
about
me
?
Do
I
go
back
to
modelling
for
a
living
?
"
"
What
choice
did
I
have
?
"
Don
Peters
asked
with
a
shrug
.
"
I
could
n't
have
lived
with
myself
if
I
had
n't
put
up
a
fight
on
behalf
of
the
men
.
"
"
Waal
,
how
are
you
gon
na
live
with
the
Corporation
execs
from
here
on
in
?
"
she
asked
caustically
.
"
And
how
am
I
gon
na
live
with
those
two-faced
blue-rinsed
bitches
back
home
?
We
're
both
losers
,
Don
,
and
everybody
knows
it
.
How
do
we
stomach
that
without
choking
?
"
He
winced
visibly
.
"
I
'm
sorry
honey
-
I
know
I
've
let
you
down
-
but
we
'll
get
by
.
"
"
Get
by
-
!
Get
by
!
"
she
yelled
.
"
I
do
n't
wan
na
get
by
,
Don
,
I
wan
na
get
on
.
You
and
I
have
always
been
winners
.
I
wanted
you
to
make
it
to
that
goddamned
fourteenth
floor
just
as
much
as
you
did
!
You
could
have
made
it
too
,
if
you
had
n't
been
so
stupid
.
"
"
How
do
you
think
I
feel
?
"
he
asked
.
"
But
I
had
to
make
the
effort
,
on
behalf
of
the
Division
.
It
would
have
worked
too
,
if
I
'd
been
supported
.
"
"
But
you
were
n't
supported
and
it
did
n't
work
-
so
what
have
you
achieved
?
"
she
asked
sarcastically
.
"
The
Corporation
is
n't
interested
in
effort
-
it
's
only
interested
in
results
.
You
know
that
.
So
where
do
we
go
from
here
?
"
"
You
tell
me
,
"
he
said
flatly
,
with
the
air
of
a
tired
and
unhappy
man
who
has
had
enough
.
And
she
did
.
Over
and
over
again
.
It
is
said
that
nothing
so
concentrates
a
man
's
mind
as
the
knowledge
that
he
is
to
be
hanged
in
the
morning
.
It
was
Sunday
and
Mark
was
working
on
the
address
he
was
to
give
at
Trinity
College
,
Dublin
.
To
his
pleasant
surprise
he
discovered
that
he
was
now
able
to
think
with
an
objective
clarity
which
stemmed
from
the
knowledge
that
he
was
now
free
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
speak
his
mind
without
fear
or
favour
.
He
had
touched
on
some
of
the
reasons
why
the
United
Kingdom
had
been
outsmarted
and
disadvantaged
when
he
had
spoken
before
the
Prime
Minister
at
the
meeting
of
the
Economic
Planning
Council
.
Now
he
would
debate
the
subject
in
depth
before
a
cosmopolitan
audience
of
European
and
international
politicians
,
bureaucrats
,
academic
advisers
and
international
managers
.
Having
dined
"
not
wisely
,
but
too
well
"
on
one
of
Georgina
's
extra-special
Sunday
lunches
,
they
were
relaxing
in
the
garden
of
their
Buckinghamshire
home
when
Mark
broke
the
news
.
In
a
very
low-key
,
matter-of-fact
way
he
described
the
meeting
in
Muldoon
's
office
and
explained
Detroit
's
decision
to
eliminate
regional
management
.
Throughout
,
Georgina
remained
calm
and
expressionless
.
"
Does
that
mean
we
shall
see
a
great
deal
more
of
each
other
than
we
have
in
the
past
?
"
she
asked
.
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
he
said
.
"
Much
more
.
"
She
smiled
.
"
I
think
I
would
like
that
.
"
Mark
returned
her
smile
.
"
But
what
about
our
standard
of
living
?
"
he
said
.
"
That
will
have
to
change
if
I
do
n't
land
a
job
with
much
the
same
salary
,
and
jobs
like
that
do
n't
exactly
grow
on
trees
,
you
know
,
particularly
when
you
're
over
fifty
.
"
"
Nonsense
,
my
dear
,
"
Georgina
told
him
.
"
You
'll
be
snapped
up
in
no
time
.
"
"
But
what
if
I
'm
not
?
We
're
still
faced
with
the
mortgage
and
school
fees
.
They
wo
n't
go
away
.
"
"
In
that
event
,
we
'll
just
have
to
lower
our
standard
of
living
,
wo
n't
we
?
"
she
said
.
"
It
does
n't
particularly
bother
me
.
I
do
n't
crave
all
those
materialistic
things
we
used
to
crave
when
we
were
young
.
Not
any
more
.
Oh
,
I
do
n't
deny
that
it
was
all
great
fun
striving
to
get
to
the
top
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
but
we
've
done
it
,
have
n't
we
?
We
've
made
the
effort
together
.
And
if
we
did
n't
get
to
the
very
top
,
well
,
it
was
near
enough
,
was
n't
it
?
And
what
do
we
have
to
prove
?
That
we
're
both
getting
older
?
That
you
still
want
to
compete
in
a
young
man
's
race
,
even
though
it
might
kill
you
?
"
She
gripped
his
hand
.
"
We
've
had
a
lot
,
and
we
've
got
a
lot
,
"
she
said
.
"
We
've
lived
good
and
bad
times
together
and
,
no
doubt
,
we
'll
share
more
.
I
'm
not
afraid
of
the
future
and
,
knowing
you
as
I
do
,
nor
should
you
be
.
You
'll
win
through
.
You
'll
show
them
all
!
"
She
stood
up
and
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
lips
.
"
Now
if
you
'd
like
me
to
tell
you
what
I
really
think
of
United
Motors
after
all
these
years
,
I
'll
do
so
.
"
she
said
.
And
her
voice
took
on
a
keener
edge
.
"
But
I
do
n't
really
like
swearing
,
and
I
'm
sure
you
've
already
sworn
quite
enough
for
both
of
us
.
So
,
for
the
moment
,
we
'll
just
leave
it
at
that
shall
we
?
"
She
linked
an
arm
through
his
.
"
Now
let's
take
a
walk
over
the
fields
with
Honey
and
Harriet
.
The
countryside
is
looking
beautiful
right
now
.
"
The
drinks
party
was
evaporating
slowly
as
guests
said
their
goodbyes
.
Clem
Bunker
was
talking
to
Mark
in
the
garden
.
"
Lovely
home
,
Mark
,
"
said
the
union
man
.
"
Will
you
be
able
to
keep
it
?
"
Mark
stopped
in
his
tracks
.
"
So
you
've
heard
already
,
"
he
said
.
"
Bush
telegraph
still
as
reliable
as
ever
.
"
"
Never
fails
,
"
Clem
replied
,
adding
,
"
Don
Peters
told
me
.
He
shook
his
head
sadly
.
"
I
really
am
sorry
,
Mark
.
Do
you
know
who
is
replacing
Peters
?
"
"
Not
a
clue
.
Has
n't
been
announced
yet
.
"
"
Another
American
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
the
union
man
.
"
Bound
to
be
.
"
They
sat
at
a
circular
wrought
iron
table
shaded
by
a
willow
.
"
Do
you
really
think
the
Division
could
go
out
as
a
result
of
this
latest
strike
?
Or
is
it
just
another
"
Cry
Wolf
situation
?
,
asked
Bunker
after
a
long
pause
.
"
The
Division
's
been
going
out
for
the
last
fifteen
years
;
slowly
but
surely
.
"
said
the
ex-management
man
.
"
This
is
the
last
straw
.
"
The
union
man
winced
.
"
To
be
honest
,
Clem
,
it
started
to
go
out
twenty
years
ago
when
we
failed
to
join
the
Common
Market
at
the
outset
.
All
the
new
industrial
investment
was
switched
to
the
continent
.
The
UK
was
effectively
a
back
number
from
that
moment
.
The
new
plants
on
the
continent
then
did
a
better
productivity
job
,
and
that
was
that
.
The
more
the
UK
Vehicle
Division
restricted
output
,
the
more
sure
it
headed
for
the
final
chop
.
"
Clem
Bunker
was
shaking
his
head
,
sadly
.
"
You
know
,
Clem
,
"
Mark
continued
,
"
if
we
ARE
going
to
fight
our
way
back
to
the
top
again
we
are
going
to
have
to
do
it
by
our
own
collective
efforts
.
Nobody
else
is
going
to
help
us
.
The
Americans
?
Ha
-
.
That
's
a
laugh
-
.
The
Russians
?
Now
there
's
an
alternative
for
you
.
The
Workers
"
Paradise
that
still
ca
n't
feed
its
own
people
.
"
Mark
raised
his
glass
in
salute
.
"
We
've
been
fighting
each
other
like
spoilt
kids
instead
of
fighting
the
real
enemy
,
our
international
competitors
.
That
"
s
our
stupidity
,
"
he
said
sadly
as
if
unburdening
himself
of
a
great
guilt
.
"
People
like
you
and
me
,
"
Clem
replied
with
a
smile
,
raising
his
glass
.
Mark
nodded
and
smiled
back
.
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
so
,
Clem
.
People
like
you
and
me
.
At
least
we
are
builders
,
not
bloody
wreckers
,
"
he
added
in
mitigation
.
Bully
for
us
.
Let
s
drink
to
that
,
Clem
said
.
"
To
the
builders
of
this
world
.
"
Andrew
and
Vicky
appeared
on
the
terrace
.
"
Do
n't
tell
me
that
you
two
are
talking
shop
,
"
Andrew
said
.
"
Do
n't
you
ever
switch
off
?
"
"
Andrew
,
my
dear
boy
,
your
father
and
I
are
talking
matters
of
great
pith
and
moment
,
"
replied
Clem
.
"
Ask
your
mother
and
Gwen
to
join
us
in
the
garden
,
will
you
Andrew
?
"
Mark
said
.
"
And
bring
another
bottle
with
you
.
This
stuff
is
very
more-ish
.
Clem
and
I
are
getting
addicted
.
"
"
Daddy
tells
me
that
you
were
apprentices
together
at
United
Motors
,
"
Vicky
said
.
She
half-turned
as
her
mother
and
Georgina
joined
them
.
"
Amazing
is
n't
it
,
Mummy
?
They
even
look
alike
,
do
n't
you
think
?
"
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
they
do
-
.
"
Gwen
Bunker
looked
from
one
man
to
the
other
,
cocking
her
head
to
one
side
as
she
appraised
the
merchandise
.
"
Do
tell
us
about
your
apprentice
days
,
Daddy
,
"
said
Vicky
.
"
What
was
it
like
?
Did
you
fight
over
the
same
girl
friends
?
"
No
"
said
her
Mother
.
"
They
kept
the
fighting
till
later
when
they
sat
on
the
management-union
joint
negotiation
committee
.
I
used
to
hear
all
about
it
.
Mark
said
this
and
I
said
that
.
"
"
Nostalgia
ai
n't
what
it
used
to
be
,
"
interjected
Andrew
,
quoting
the
latest
college
graffiti
.
Clem
grinned
.
"
Do
you
remember
,
Mark
when
you
had
to
strip
naked
and
tie
that
sack
around
your
waist
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Do
I
remember
!
How
could
I
ever
forget
!
"
said
Mark
,
holding
a
hand
over
his
eyes
.
"
Whatever
happened
?
"
asked
Vicky
.
Punctuated
by
interjections
from
Mark
,
Clem
told
the
story
of
how
Mark
had
fallen
into
a
barrel
of
high
viscosity
oil
while
standing
on
the
lid
to
get
at
another
barrel
with
his
hand
pump
.
He
had
been
stripped
naked
in
the
oil
store
,
where
the
incident
had
occurred
during
their
very
first
month
as
apprentices
,
and
his
clothes
triumphantly
borne
aloft
to
the
plating
shop
to
be
washed
in
one
of
the
hot
water
tanks
.
When
the
news
hit
the
factory
floor
,
young
girls
were
sent
off
to
the
stores
with
requisitions
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
loincloth
apprentice
.
One
young
girl
who
had
stood
giggling
at
the
hapless
Mark
for
more
than
ten
minutes
was
told
that
she
could
go
back
to
her
department
as
she
'd
waited
long
enough
.
When
she
objected
that
she
should
n't
be
sent
back
empty
handed
,
she
was
shown
what
had
been
written
on
her
requisition
.
"
Please
supply
:
ONE
LONG
WEIGHT
"
.
"
But
how
did
you
come
to
go
your
separate
ways
?
"
Vicky
asked
as
the
laughter
subsided
.
"
What
influenced
you
both
?
,
"
Well
,
"
said
Clem
.
"
I
know
what
influenced
me
.
It
was
a
man
named
Arthur
Billstock
.
A
toolmaker
.
I
was
put
to
work
with
him
on
the
same
bench
and
he
not
only
taught
me
toolmaking
,
he
also
taught
me
about
the
trade
union
movement
and
the
kind
of
society
he
wanted
to
see
.
"
"
Ah
,
the
local
militant
,
"
said
Andrew
.
"
No
,
not
at
all
,
"
Clem
replied
.
"
In
fact
he
was
really
a
very
quiet
and
rather
reserved
man
,
who
preferred
to
keep
in
the
background
rather
than
hog
the
limelight
.
We
talked
a
lot
during
those
months
on
the
same
bench
together
,
and
it
was
his
influence
which
set
me
on
the
trade
union
path
.
If
it
had
n't
been
for
Arthur
Billstock
,
I
would
probably
have
taken
the
same
road
as
Mark
.
That
was
the
road
we
apprentices
were
expected
to
take
.
Must
have
been
crazy
not
to
do
so
.
Might
have
ended
up
with
a
house
like
this
,
"
he
added
with
a
laugh
.
"
He
's
always
been
a
bit
funny
in
the
head
,
"
joked
Gwen
.
How
about
you
,
Mark
?
What
influenced
you
?
she
added
.
"
Well
,
"
said
Mark
,
topping
up
their
glasses
.
"
I
suppose
I
should
have
followed
Clem
into
the
trade
union
movement
.
We
apprentices
were
never
short
of
advice
on
what
was
wrong
with
society
and
the
system
.
But
I
found
it
all
too
negative
and
depressing
.
Success
was
supposed
to
be
reserved
for
those
with
silver
spoons
in
their
mouths
.
I
well
remember
the
words
of
an
old
foreman
who
said
to
me
,
Son
,
even
if
you
have
the
talent
and
ability
to
take
you
to
the
top
,
there
is
still
no
guarantee
that
you
will
ever
get
there
,
or
even
half
way
.
But
as
sure
as
God
made
little
apples
,
you
certainly
wo
n't
get
there
if
you
do
n't
make
the
effort
.
"
That
clinched
it
for
me
.
I
suppose
that
simple
precept
from
that
old
foreman
stood
me
in
good
stead
for
thirty
odd
years
,
until
now
.
"
"
Why
until
now
,
Dad
?
"
enquired
Andrew
,
unaware
of
his
father
's
predicament
.
"
I
suppose
I
should
have
said
up
to
now
,
"
Mark
replied
disarmingly
.
"
Perhaps
it
will
help
me
over
the
next
thirty
,
"
he
added
as
an
afterthought
.
"
But
you
are
both
very
similar
men
,
from
similar
backgrounds
and
with
the
same
basic
objectives
in
society
,
"
Vicky
said
,
with
the
air
of
a
very
puzzled
young
lady
.
"
Do
n't
you
still
want
the
same
things
?
"
Oh
,
but
we
do
,
"
her
father
told
her
.
"
We
both
want
to
improve
things
;
to
build
a
better
world
.
I
thought
that
I
could
make
my
contribution
by
joining
the
Trade
Union
movement
,
and
improve
things
from
there
.
"
"
And
I
thought
I
could
make
mine
by
designing
and
making
better
products
,
and
selling
them
to
the
world
,
"
said
Mark
.
"
Now
how
about
something
to
eat
?
I
'm
starving
.
"
A
few
days
later
the
national
press
carried
the
headlines
that
the
UM
plants
in
the
Midlands
had
now
been
made
idle
as
a
consequence
of
the
Merseyside
strike
.
The
flow
of
supplies
into
the
Midlands
from
the
Merseyside
works
had
dried
up
completely
and
with
no
apparent
end
to
the
stoppage
in
sight
,
lay-offs
took
immediate
effect
.
Feelings
were
running
high
at
all
plants
,
but
for
different
reasons
.
The
news
that
Don
Peters
was
being
replaced
had
been
received
with
great
disappointment
and
alarm
throughout
the
Midlands
by
management
,
unions
and
employees
alike
.
Disappointment
that
they
were
losing
the
best
American
M
D
they
had
ever
had
,
after
less
than
one
year
,
and
alarm
in
the
knowledge
that
his
demotion
almost
certainly
meant
the
end
of
the
recovery
and
expansion
plans
,
and
possibly
the
end
of
vehicle
manufacture
in
the
UK
.
Such
was
the
state
of
concern
at
the
Midlands
plants
that
conveners
and
local
members
of
Parliament
were
demanding
intervention
at
Government
level
.
Some
of
the
thirty
thousand
workers
employed
at
the
Midlands
plants
,
incensed
by
the
idleness
forced
on
them
by
the
Merseysiders
and
alarmed
at
the
bleak
prospect
ahead
,
stormed
through
the
streets
to
Clem
Bunker
's
regional
office
demanding
action
to
get
the
Merseyside
plants
back
to
work
.
Bunker
was
jostled
,
heckled
,
spat
upon
and
sworn
at
as
he
tried
to
keep
some
semblance
of
order
to
explain
the
action
he
had
already
taken
.
After
two
very
noisy
and
unruly
hours
,
with
the
local
police
trying
to
keep
law
and
order
,
the
angry
mob
reluctantly
dispersed
.
On
Merseyside
,
the
plant
had
split
into
two
factions
over
the
strike
;
those
who
supported
Clasper
in
his
demand
that
the
strike
be
continued
until
the
sacked
shop
steward
had
been
reinstated
,
and
those
who
took
the
view
that
Clasper
was
playing
power
politics
with
their
jobs
at
stake
.
The
latter
demanded
that
the
strike
be
called
off
to
avoid
even
worse
news
.
This
view
represented
the
thoughts
of
an
ever-growing
majority
whose
intuitive
feeling
was
that
the
Merseyside
plant
was
heading
for
total
and
irreversible
closure
with
the
loss
of
ten
thousand
jobs
.
Clasper
was
becoming
more
isolated
,
with
his
dwindling
support
coming
from
a
small
core
of
left-wingers
who
considered
the
fight
to
be
a
question
of
principle
,
namely
union
solidarity
against
management
.
Bunker
's
early
efforts
to
bring
about
a
settlement
had
been
angrily
brushed
aside
by
Clasper
,
who
told
the
regional
officer
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
his
help
was
not
needed
.
The
Merseyside
members
would
resolve
the
dispute
in
their
own
way
without
his
help
.
Bunker
knew
instinctively
that
Clasper
could
not
,
and
would
not
,
resolve
the
dispute
himself
and
that
the
effects
of
the
stoppage
would
very
soon
be
felt
far
beyond
the
confines
of
United
Motors
as
one
supply
industry
after
another
experienced
a
precipitous
drop
in
demand
.
He
also
knew
that
if
Clasper
was
to
be
toppled
from
his
influential
position
as
plant
convener
-
which
was
essential
to
the
long
term
recovery
of
the
plant
-
he
would
have
to
be
seen
to
be
toppled
by
his
own
members
,
acting
in
their
own
interests
.
He
therefore
resolved
to
keep
out
of
the
way
and
let
Clasper
hang
himself
.
The
Midlands
'
plants
had
been
putting
great
pressure
on
the
Merseysiders
to
call
off
the
strike
,
as
a
result
of
which
a
mass
meeting
at
Pier
Head
,
Liverpool
,
had
been
demanded
to
vote
on
the
question
of
a
return
to
work
.
Although
this
had
initially
been
rejected
out
of
hand
by
Clasper
,
he
had
been
left
in
no
doubt
that
his
members
would
hold
their
own
mass
meeting
without
him
if
he
chose
not
to
call
it
.
At
the
same
time
,
hundreds
of
workers
in
the
Midlands
plants
who
had
heard
about
the
Pier
Head
meeting
on
the
grapevine
now
decided
to
drive
up
to
Liverpool
to
influence
the
return
to
work
vote
.
Confident
that
Clasper
would
be
brought
down
by
his
own
members
without
any
interference
from
him
,
Bunker
concluded
that
his
best
course
of
action
would
be
to
emulate
Brer
Rabbit
on
this
occasion
,
and
"
lie
low
and
say
nuffin'
.
"
Mark
's
address
to
an
international
audience
at
Trinity
College
,
Dublin
,
came
as
a
shock
to
European
Commissioners
,
Government
Ministers
and
their
academic
advisers
.
He
had
been
invited
to
speak
on
the
factors
which
influenced
investment
location
decisions
as
seen
from
the
viewpoint
of
a
European
Industrial
Planning
Manager
.
He
was
the
fourth
of
twelve
speakers
over
the
three
day
conference
,
the
others
being
Ministers
,
Commissioners
,
Economists
and
Academics
,
and
had
been
introduced
by
the
Chairman
as
"
The
Man
at
the
Sharp
End
"
.
He
had
based
his
paper
strictly
on
his
own
practical
experiences
,
working
within
the
labyrinth
of
conflicting
laws
,
rules
and
regulations
imposed
by
individual
Governments
within
the
EEC
,
EFTA
and
East
Europe
.
He
sought
to
show
how
the
laws
imposed
by
certain
countries
to
attract
internationally
mobile
inward
investment
could
only
operate
to
the
detriment
of
other
states
.
He
exposed
the
many
devious
ways
in
which
Governments
bent
the
rules
of
free
trade
in
their
favour
,
while
flying
the
free
trade
banner
.
He
described
how
the
Japanese
used
a
laser
beam
strategy
within
a
poorly
drafted
law
to
penetrate
the
European
market
while
protecting
their
own
domestic
market
behind
a
dynastic
organisational
structure
which
only
permitted
import
access
when
the
dynasty
deemed
it
politically
expedient
to
do
so
.
He
itemised
the
steps
by
which
East
European
Governments
gained
access
to
the
free
markets
of
West
Europe
,
while
denying
the
same
freedom
of
access
to
West
European
manufacturers
,
and
revealed
how
reciprocal
trade
deals
negotiated
with
the
multi-nationals
resulted
in
unsuspecting
third
party
EEC
Governments
being
saddled
with
the
import
bill
.
He
then
went
on
to
describe
the
very
considerable
commercial
and
economic
disadvantages
experienced
by
peripheral
industrial
countries
compared
with
the
enormous
advantages
enjoyed
by
the
privileged
centrally
placed
Golden
Triangle
countries
and
called
to
question
the
entire
concept
of
a
European
budget
which
incredibly
penalised
the
poorer
peripheral
countries
instead
of
applying
the
penalty
the
other
way
round
.
He
concluded
his
forty-five
minute
address
by
commenting
on
the
political
factors
which
influenced
investment
location
decisions
and
emphasised
that
future
multi-national
planners
would
do
well
to
have
a
much
more
sensitive
appreciation
of
the
social
and
political
implications
of
their
actions
.
Government
intervention
would
inevitably
follow
if
Governments
had
reason
to
believe
that
their
interests
were
not
being
fairly
served
.
He
sat
down
,
knowing
in
his
heart
of
hearts
that
for
as
long
as
Randy
Mueller
had
a
major
part
to
play
in
UM
's
corporate
planning
,
his
basic
criteria
would
be
:
"
Is
it
good
for
the
Corporation
?
Is
it
good
for
the
United
States
?
And
,
above
all
,
is
it
good
for
Randy
Mueller
?
"
Delegate
after
delegate
during
the
three
day
conference
subsequently
referred
to
his
address
to
confess
that
the
real
world
of
the
International
Planning
Manager
was
a
totally
different
world
from
that
perceived
by
politicians
and
their
academic
advisers
.
One
distinguished-looking
delegate
,
who
Mark
recognised
as
the
Chairman
of
the
British
Conservative
party
,
introduced
himself
to
say
that
people
with
his
experience
should
put
themselves
forward
to
serve
in
the
European
Parliament
.
"
I
am
going
to
put
your
name
on
the
list
we
are
drawing
up
,
"
he
said
grandiloquently
.
"
I
feel
sure
that
one
of
the
industrial
constituencies
would
be
interested
in
a
chap
with
your
industrial
background
.
"
Shortly
after
his
return
to
England
,
Mark
received
an
invitation
to
address
an
all-party
Committee
of
Members
of
Parliament
.
He
was
invited
to
develop
his
Dublin
address
with
particular
reference
to
the
economic
and
commercial
disadvantages
of
peripheral
industrial
countries
,
such
as
the
United
Kingdom
,
within
the
EEC
.
He
was
also
specifically
asked
to
speak
not
as
an
executive
of
United
Motors
,
but
as
an
Englishman
.
As
he
had
been
invited
to
dine
with
Members
afterwards
,
his
secretary
had
booked
him
into
The
Howard
Hotel
,
a
few
hundred
yards
from
Parliament
Square
on
the
Victoria
Embankment
,
overlooking
the
Tower
of
London
to
the
east
and
the
Houses
of
Parliament
to
the
west
.
As
Mark
strolled
from
the
hotel
and
crossed
the
road
to
the
riverside
walk
,
he
had
a
strange
feeling
that
the
evening
ahead
would
re-shape
his
future
.
Outwardly
he
was
calm
and
composed
as
he
walked
in
the
warm
evening
sunshine
towards
the
House
,
but
like
the
swans
gliding
serenely
across
the
water
,
he
too
was
paddling
like
hell
underneath
.
Big
Ben
struck
the
quarter
hour
and
he
checked
his
watch
.
Ahead
of
him
,
the
tail-end
stragglers
of
the
daily
rush
hour
traffic
scurried
across
Westminster
Bridge
.
The
House
of
Parliament
loomed
up
and
his
heart
began
to
thump
.
He
recalled
the
first
time
he
had
seen
the
impressive
building
as
a
schoolboy
on
a
day
's
outing
to
see
the
sights
of
London
.
He
could
picture
the
scene
as
if
it
were
yesterday
.
The
history
master
had
gathered
up
his
flock
and
had
paused
outside
the
source
of
power
in
the
Commonwealth
and
Empire
to
eulogize
on
the
great
men
of
the
past
who
had
entered
the
hallowed
portals
.
Mark
was
one
of
twelve
young
boys
and
girls
clustered
around
him
to
lap
up
his
words
of
wisdom
.
"
Through
these
portals
passed
such
illustrious
men
as
Pitt
,
Walpole
,
Disraeli
and
Gladstone
,
to
carve
their
names
on
the
glorious
history
of
England
,
"
he
had
said
to
his
young
and
captive
audience
.
At
the
mention
of
the
name
Disraeli
,
Mark
had
been
transported
into
a
world
of
his
own
.
His
grandfather
had
been
a
master
baker
and
,
in
one
of
the
many
family
stories
Mark
had
heard
at
his
grandfather
's
knee
,
he
had
been
told
of
how
his
great-grandfather
had
served
Benjamin
Disraeli
with
a
standing
daily
order
of
twelve
French
loaves
,
burnt
and
rasped
.
It
was
the
burning
and
rasping
bit
which
had
fascinated
Mark
.
His
grandfather
had
explained
that
the
only
true
way
to
bake
bread
was
to
burn
it
black
and
then
rasp
off
the
burnt
extremities
with
a
coarse
file
.
Mark
had
adored
his
grandparents
and
would
listen
spellbound
to
their
stories
for
hours
on
end
.
The
history
master
had
interrupted
his
reverie
with
a
smart
clip
round
the
ear
.
"
Stop
daydreaming
,
Sanders
,
will
you
boy
?
Give
us
,
pray
,
the
benefit
of
your
undivided
attention
.
Now
sir
,
he
had
continued
acidly
,
gripping
Mark
by
the
ear
,
"
tell
me
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
,
precisely
what
I
have
been
talking
about
.
"
"
Disraeli
,
sir
.
Twelve
French
loaves
,
burnt
and
rasped
,
sir
.
"
blurted
the
surprised
boy
,
and
the
other
children
giggled
hysterically
.
"
You
stupid
boy
,
"
cried
the
master
.
"
What
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
?
If
it
's
not
cricket
and
Frank
Woolley
it
's
something
else
.
Now
it
's
twelve
French
loaves
,
burnt
and
rasped
,
whatever
that
means
.
I
despair
of
you
,
boy
.
One
thing
for
certain
,
Sanders
,
you
wo
n't
be
coming
here
to
the
Mother
of
Parliaments
to
give
us
all
the
benefit
of
your
profound
wisdom
.
It
'll
be
some
factory
workbench
for
you
boy
,
where
,
if
you
continue
to
dream
your
stupid
little
daydreams
,
you
'll
end
up
chopping
your
fingers
off
.
Is
that
understood
?
"
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
Mark
had
been
twelve
at
the
time
and
beset
by
emotional
turmoil
.
His
parents
had
recently
parted
.
Now
he
recalled
how
,
on
the
second
night
after
his
mother
had
left
home
,
he
had
climbed
out
of
bed
in
the
late
evening
and
slipped
unnoticed
from
the
house
to
run
over
a
mile
to
Bournemouth
Central
Railway
Station
to
catch
a
train
to
nearby
Christchurch
,
where
his
mother
had
gone
to
live
with
her
sister
.
It
was
a
cold
night
in
late
autumn
and
the
rain
had
lashed
down
unremittingly
.
By
the
time
he
had
reached
the
shelter
of
the
station
he
was
soaked
to
the
skin
.
He
had
paid
three
pence
at
the
booking
office
for
his
ticket
and
,
after
waiting
ten
minutes
or
so
on
the
cold
and
draughty
platform
for
the
next
London-bound
train
,
he
had
arrived
at
Christchurch
some
ten
minutes
later
to
run
through
torrential
rain
toward
the
group
of
cottages
which
flanked
the
open
park
in
the
town
centre
.
He
was
not
certain
which
cottage
his
aunt
rented
during
the
winter
.
In
the
spring
and
summer
she
lived
in
a
cottage
on
the
banks
of
the
river
Stour
just
below
Tuckton
bridge
.
Mark
had
spent
many
idyllic
summer
days
sailing
and
fishing
with
his
brothers
and
his
aunt
on
the
beautiful
river
,
but
had
never
been
to
her
winter
cottage
.
The
rain
continued
to
beat
down
upon
him
as
he
ran
across
the
dark
and
sodden
park
just
before
midnight
.
With
the
exception
of
one
cottage
,
where
a
light
still
shone
in
the
window
,
all
the
others
were
in
total
darkness
.
Mark
ran
to
the
one
and
only
cottage
with
the
light
and
was
as
surprised
as
his
aunt
when
she
opened
the
door
.
She
gave
a
great
gasp
of
anguished
amazement
at
the
sight
of
the
drowned
rat
of
a
boy
standing
before
her
,
the
rain
pouring
off
his
sodden
hair
to
run
in
rivulets
down
his
pale
face
.
Oh
my
God
,
Mark
sweetheart
,
"
she
cried
,
pulling
the
soaked
boy
to
her
bosom
.
"
Grace
,
"
she
called
out
to
his
mother
,
"
it
's
Mark
.
"
His
beautiful
and
adored
mother
quickly
appeared
from
the
sitting-room
and
hugged
him
nearly
to
death
on
the
doorstep
.
But
despite
his
repeated
and
heartfelt
pleas
to
his
mother
to
come
home
,
she
steadfastly
refused
to
do
so
,
and
she
never
did
.
The
divorce
was
made
absolute
two
years
later
.
Mark
stood
for
a
few
moments
at
the
corner
of
Parliament
Street
and
Bridge
Street
.
It
was
nearly
forty
years
since
the
history
master
had
bawled
him
out
on
the
pavement
over
there
,
in
front
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
"
One
thing
is
certain
Sanders
-
"
he
had
said
,
"
you
wo
n't
be
coming
here
-
.
"
Mark
crossed
Parliament
Square
and
even
the
statue
of
Churchill
appeared
to
be
growling
at
the
sorry
state
of
affairs
in
the
land
where
a
pettifogging
ex-apprentice
was
invited
to
address
Right
Honourable
Members
of
both
Houses
.
He
climbed
the
steps
leading
to
the
central
lobby
and
was
stopped
by
a
burly
policeman
who
asked
the
nature
of
his
business
.
"
Name
's
Sanders
.
I
am
addressing
an
all-party
committee
,
"
Mark
replied
,
feeling
rather
important
as
he
uttered
the
words
.
"
Bully
for
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
policeman
with
a
smile
.
"
Go
ahead
sir
.
"
Mark
passed
through
a
security
screen
to
make
his
way
to
the
impressive
central
lobby
where
the
Chairman
of
the
Committee
was
already
waiting
to
receive
him
.
It
was
six
twenty-seven
.
After
the
usual
pleasantries
he
took
Mark
along
one
of
the
labyrinth
of
corridors
flanked
with
busts
of
the
famous
,
and
stopped
before
a
heavy
oak-panelled
door
attended
by
a
liveried
usher
.
After
exchanging
a
few
words
,
the
usher
opened
the
door
and
Mark
was
escorted
into
a
debating
chamber
shaped
in
the
form
of
a
horseshoe
,
with
a
raised
dais
at
the
open
end
upon
which
were
two
heavy
oak
chairs
,
one
for
the
Chairman
and
the
other
for
the
speaker
.
The
room
had
seating
capacity
for
about
eighty
and
Mark
saw
that
it
was
about
half
full
.
Before
being
taken
to
the
platform
,
he
was
introduced
to
those
members
of
the
Committee
who
happened
to
be
milling
around
the
entrance
.
He
recognised
familiar
names
and
faces
from
all
parties
,
and
also
noticed
that
everybody
carried
copies
of
his
Dublin
paper
.
He
was
then
escorted
to
the
dais
,
where
the
Chairman
launched
into
a
brief
introduction
.
"
Your
Dublin
paper
whetted
our
appetite
,
Mr
Sanders
,
"
he
said
in
conclusion
.
"
We
now
look
forward
to
the
main
course
this
evening
.
"
Mark
rose
from
his
chair
fully
aware
that
politicians
believed
themselves
to
be
the
best
informed
people
in
the
world
,
which
made
them
a
very
sceptical
audience
for
any
speaker
.
They
sprawled
across
the
padded
benches
before
him
with
the
somewhat
jaded
air
of
men
who
expected
to
hear
nothing
new
.
He
began
jocularly
by
saying
that
he
rose
to
address
them
with
some
apprehension
,
reminded
of
a
piece
of
graffiti
he
had
seen
on
a
Whitehall
notice
board
which
had
read
,
"
I
used
to
be
indecisive
-
but
now
I
'm
not
so
sure
,
,
which
brought
a
few
chuckles
from
the
floor
.
"
I
propose
to
describe
the
very
considerable
commercial
and
economic
disadvantages
incurred
by
the
United
Kingdom
by
comparison
with
other
European
countries
when
investment
locations
"
decisions
are
taken
by
multi-nationals
,
,
Mark
continued
.
"
And
also
to
offer
some
suggestions
as
to
how
the
UK
handicap
could
be
reduced
and
its
disadvantages
turned
to
its
advantage
.
"
A
few
eyebrows
were
raised
at
such
unequivocal
presumptions
.
"
You
have
also
invited
me
to
wear
a
British
hat
,
"
Mark
continued
.
"
It
will
be
a
pleasant
change
to
do
so
.
"
He
began
by
giving
several
examples
of
how
Governments
in
both
West
and
East
Europe
had
obtained
major
United
Motors
'
investment
projects
by
highly
discriminatory
and
blatantly
unfair
means
,
which
had
operated
to
the
detriment
of
the
UK
.
He
was
suddenly
thrown
off
balance
by
the
hurried
departure
of
a
Minister
.
He
was
aware
that
Members
had
to
come
and
go
at
irregular
intervals
at
the
behest
of
their
lords
and
masters
when
the
House
was
in
session
,
but
he
feared
the
worst
.
He
faltered
,
cleared
his
throat
,
drank
liberally
from
the
glass
before
him
,
and
continued
.
His
morale
was
uplifted
a
few
minutes
later
when
the
same
Minister
returned
with
a
gaggle
of
additional
members
evidently
called
from
the
floor
of
the
House
.
Mark
warmed
to
the
task
and
continued
with
renewed
confidence
.
"
There
are
many
instances
where
UK
investment
and
product
costs
have
been
up
to
twenty
per
cent
below
other
European
countries
,
but
the
investment
has
still
been
located
on
the
continent
because
of
unfair
political
pressures
and
highly
discriminatory
practices
,
"
he
added
to
gasps
of
pained
surprise
.
"
The
Treaty
of
Rome
rules
on
competitive
costs
and
prices
have
been
blatantly
disregarded
by
certain
countries
and
the
multi-nationals
,
"
he
added
.
"
Just
consider
,
for
example
,
the
adverse
economic
effect
on
Britain
of
Ford
's
highly
discriminatory
investment
plan
agreed
with
the
Spanish
Government
-
.
"
For
the
best
part
of
an
hour
he
exposed
what
was
really
going
on
in
the
international
motor
industry
.
His
audience
was
very
quiet
.
Hardly
a
muscle
moved
.
"
Corporate
plans
of
the
Fords
,
UMs
and
Chryslers
of
this
world
influence
and
shape
our
destiny
.
They
determine
whether
Britain
is
to
be
a
winner
or
loser
country
.
Sadly
for
Britain
they
have
already
made
the
decision
that
Britain
is
to
be
a
loser
country
,
"
he
said
dramatically
.
Pained
expressions
crossed
the
faces
of
the
now
alarmed
politicians
.
"
For
example
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
The
corporate
plan
of
United
Motors
is
to
phase-out
vehicle
and
component
manufacture
in
the
UK
and
import
its
requirements
from
new
plants
on
the
continent
,
from
East
Europe
,
the
Far
East
-
including
Japan
-
and
from
the
United
States
itself
,
with
the
loss
of
fifty
thousand
UK
jobs
,
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
if
one
includes
jobs
lost
in
the
UK
supplier
chain
.
"
he
added
.
There
was
a
gasp
at
this
disclosure
.
Constituency
problems
now
loomed
large
.
"
By
the
late
eighties
the
global
plans
of
the
major
US
multinationals
will
have
created
a
massive
UK
trade
deficit
of
around
seven
billion
pounds
which
will
go
on
increasing
with
the
growth
of
the
number
of
vehicles
in
use
.
These
companies
have
been
Britain
's
top
exporters
in
the
past
.
Seven
years
from
now
they
will
be
Britain
's
top
importers
.
What
will
be
the
effect
on
the
pound
sterling
and
on
Britain
's
economic
standing
in
the
world
as
the
trade
gap
widens
?
What
will
be
the
employment
?
"
he
asked
ominously
.
"
And
yet
,
this
frightening
scenario
I
outline
to
you
this
evening
is
precisely
what
will
happen
arising
from
the
global
plans
of
these
major
American-owned
multi-nationals
.
"
Mark
's
voice
had
trailed
away
to
a
whisper
.
His
words
had
produced
group
paralysis
.
Not
a
muscle
moved
.
Mark
was
now
speaking
out
with
a
vengeance
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
free
from
corporate
restraints
,
to
say
what
he
really
thought
.
He
had
no
qualms
in
doing
so
.
If
those
with
inside
knowledge
of
the
facts
did
n't
speak
up
for
Britain
,
who
the
hell
would
?
That
was
his
justification
.
His
eyes
ranged
the
room
.
"
The
Prime
Minister
has
clearly
stated
her
intention
to
bring
about
the
industrial
regeneration
of
Britain
to
correct
the
decline
of
the
last
few
years
,
"
he
said
vigorously
.
"
She
has
appealed
to
industrial
leaders
to
help
her
redress
the
trade
imbalance
.
"
"
What
price
the
American
contribution
toward
that
objective
?
"
he
asked
in
a
hushed
tone
.
"
How
can
the
Prime
Minister
achieve
her
national
targets
when
US
corporate
plans
move
in
a
diametrically
opposite
direction
to
compound
Britain
's
trade
problems
.
What
would
the
American
Government
say
if
the
roles
were
reversed
?
"
he
added
to
nods
from
all
quarters
.
Mark
paused
again
to
take
a
very
long
drink
.
"
Fortunately
Britain
can
win
if
we
learn
from
past
mistakes
,
and
I
would
now
like
to
conclude
by
outlining
certain
strategic
proposals
for
your
consideration
,
which
would
put
Britain
firmly
on
the
upward
path
to
meet
the
Prime
Minister
's
long-term
objectives
.
"
Mark
then
described
a
ten
point
plan
and
summarised
its
resultant
effect
.
The
UK
vehicle
and
component
industry
sectors
alone
would
progressively
benefit
to
the
value
of
eight
billion
pounds
sterling
by
year
five
.
This
would
correct
the
Motor
industry
trade
imbalance
without
the
need
to
export
one
additional
unit
.
Unemployment
in
the
sector
would
be
reduced
by
two
hundred
thousand
,
and
existing
manufacturing
capacity
,
previously
made
idle
by
imports
,
would
once
more
be
fully
utilised
,
thus
improving
operating
profit
and
return
on
investment
.
Mark
ended
his
address
by
saying
,
"
The
European
and
international
trade
war
is
really
between
those
Governments
who
fix
the
rules
of
the
game
to
suit
themselves
,
and
those
who
play
the
game
according
to
Treaty
of
Rome
rules
.
Britain
has
been
a
loser
country
in
a
manifestly
unfair
trade
environment
.
It
has
allowed
itself
to
be
outsmarted
by
governments
who
are
not
afraid
to
bend
the
rules
in
their
favour
,
aided
and
abetted
by
American
multi-nationals
whose
allegiance
is
to
the
United
States
,
naturally
.
Britain
is
expendable
.
"
He
looked
around
him
.
"
Why
not
think
and
act
as
Great
Britain
Incorporate
?
"
.
he
asked
.
Unbeknown
to
Mark
,
one
of
the
titled
politicians
present
also
happened
to
be
an
international
banker
and
financial
advisor
to
several
US
corporations
.
He
phoned
New
York
immediately
after
the
Westminster
meeting
.
A
voice
at
the
other
end
said
wearily
in
a
faintly
Irish
accent
.
"
Ah
well
.
I
suppose
we
will
have
to
take
appropriate
action
will
we
not
-
.
Thanks
for
putting
me
in
the
picture
,
Patrick
.
"
The
magnate
placed
the
phone
back
on
the
receiver
-
slowly
.
"
Thorns
left
to
fester
-
"
he
mused
.
"
Maybe
we
should
contact
the
special
outside
Agency
.
"
He
thought
very
,
very
carefully
for
a
minute
or
more
and
then
picked
up
his
private
phone
and
dialled
a
number
.
Two
days
later
,
Mark
received
a
phone
call
from
10
,
Downing
Street
,
asking
for
permission
to
publish
the
Dublin
paper
,
and
his
submission
to
the
House
Select
Committee
,
as
an
appendix
to
the
Government
's
proposed
White
Paper
shortly
to
go
before
the
House
.
He
readily
gave
his
approval
.
At
Question
Time
in
the
House
,
the
Prime
Minister
agreed
that
a
paper
submitted
by
a
European
Planning
Manager
,
now
being
studied
by
the
Government
and
the
European
Commission
appeared
to
offer
real
solutions
to
Britain
's
excessive
contribution
to
the
European
budget
.
Mark
received
several
letters
and
phone
calls
from
Members
of
Parliament
,
all
but
one
in
support
of
his
two
papers
and
proposals
.
The
Member
who
wrote
to
express
his
disagreement
invited
Mark
to
the
House
to
discuss
his
reasons
for
taking
the
opposite
viewpoint
.
He
received
Mark
in
the
central
lobby
and
took
him
to
the
Members
'
tea
room
for
a
chat
over
a
pot
of
tea
.
He
was
a
young
lawyer
of
about
thirty
in
his
first
year
in
Parliament
,
who
had
sufficiently
impressed
someone
in
Government
to
have
been
given
the
job
of
Junior
Minister
at
the
Trade
office
.
He
came
straight
to
the
point
in
a
rather
superior
manner
,
saying
that
he
was
a
European
federalist
and
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
it
did
n't
matter
a
tuppeny
damn
whether
industrial
investments
took
place
in
Germany
,
France
or
the
UK
.
He
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
irrelevant
whether
Britain
had
an
industrial
base
at
all
if
it
could
be
shown
that
it
would
be
more
sensible
,
from
a
European
point
of
view
,
for
Britain
to
become
a
service
nation
importing
its
manufactured
product
requirements
.
Mark
listened
aghast
at
the
naive
and
dangerous
idealism
of
the
young
,
starry-eyed
politician
,
who
was
light
years
away
from
knowing
what
really
went
on
at
the
sharp
end
of
European
and
international
trade
.
"
If
you
believe
that
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
with
as
much
politeness
as
he
could
muster
,
"
you
will
naturally
not
share
the
concern
I
have
expressed
in
my
papers
.
We
are
obviously
poles
apart
.
Do
you
wish
to
discuss
the
subject
further
,
or
would
we
both
be
wasting
our
time
?
"
"
Wasting
our
time
,
I
think
.
"
said
the
young
Minister
,
forcing
a
laugh
.
"
But
as
I
have
invited
you
here
,
let's
discuss
the
subject
a
little
further
at
least
.
"
Mark
asked
him
how
he
could
reconcile
his
views
with
what
was
clearly
Britain
s
basic
needs
;
the
need
to
maintain
a
strong
manufacturing
base
as
a
defence
capability
;
the
need
to
correct
a
massive
and
worsening
trade
deficit
on
manufactured
products
;
and
the
need
to
provide
talented
school-leavers
with
creative
career
opportunities
in
the
manufacturing
sector
as
designers
,
physicists
,
chemists
and
engineers
as
opposed
to
the
more
mundane
jobs
in
the
service
sector
as
warehousemen
and
handlers
of
other
countries
'
goods
.
The
young
politician
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
"
Irrelevancies
,
"
he
said
dismissively
.
"
Top
talent
will
always
be
in
demand
where
the
jobs
are
,
and
if
the
jobs
are
on
the
continent
,
so
be
it
.
National
trade
deficits
will
become
meaningless
under
a
European
monetary
system
with
a
common
currency
.
And
as
for
defence
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
Britain
would
be
defended
by
arms
manufactured
in
Germany
or
France
just
as
well
as
by
arms
manufactured
in
Britain
,
if
this
were
necessary
for
good
economic
reasons
.
"
Mark
raised
an
eyebrow
.
"
Your
belief
that
Germany
or
France
would
unfailingly
defend
Britain
and
British
interests
against
an
aggressor
is
not
one
that
I
share
.
Does
the
Minister
of
Defence
share
your
views
?
,
"
No
,
he
does
not
!
"
snapped
the
Junior
Minister
of
Trade
.
"
Thank
God
for
that
,
"
Mark
declaimed
.
"
Your
views
are
too
simplistic
for
me
,
"
said
the
young
politician
loftily
.
"
As
you
say
,
we
are
poles
apart
.
Let's
leave
it
at
that
.
"
He
rose
to
leave
and
Mark
followed
.
"
Before
you
entered
Parliament
,
what
did
you
do
?
"
Mark
asked
.
The
young
man
's
head
went
up
.
"
I
was
-
I
am
-
a
barrister
.
"
"
But
you
are
a
Junior
Minister
of
Trade
.
You
're
not
attached
to
the
Attorney
General
's
office
,
"
said
Mark
with
an
air
of
feigned
surprise
.
The
Junior
Minister
pulled
himself
up
to
his
full
height
of
five
foot
three
,
and
in
a
plummy
voice
rich
with
haughty
disdain
said
,
"
What
difference
does
that
make
?
"
"
Well
,
you
would
n't
expect
an
industrial
manager
to
be
made
Attorney
General
,
would
you
?
"
Mark
asked
.
The
young
politician
tugged
at
an
ear
lobe
and
eyed
him
narrowly
.
"
By
that
remark
,
I
take
it
you
mean
that
I
know
little
or
nothing
about
industrial
or
trade
matters
?
"
Mark
looked
him
straight
in
the
eye
.
"
I
think
it
would
be
a
great
presumption
on
your
part
if
you
thought
you
did
,
"
he
replied
firmly
,
putting
the
young
man
down
.
The
self-important
politician
smiled
coldly
.
"
You
have
a
nice
way
of
expressing
yourself
which
,
I
suppose
,
reflects
your
industrial
background
.
"
The
word
"
industrial
"
came
out
like
a
swearword
.
"
Good
day
to
you
,
sir
,
"
the
Junior
Minister
said
formally
.
"
Thank
you
for
responding
to
my
invitation
.
"
They
shook
hands
,
but
it
was
clearly
on
the
unspoken
understanding
that
they
could
still
come
out
fighting
.
They
went
their
separate
ways
:
the
young
politician
to
the
floor
of
the
House
to
promote
new
industrial
and
commercial
legislation
which
would
,
no
doubt
,
exercise
his
legal
mind
,
and
the
industrial
manager
to
the
central
lobby
,
and
the
way
out
.
Mark
drove
home
along
the
M1
reflecting
that
the
French
and
Germans
in
particular
would
be
pleased
to
erect
monuments
to
the
idealistic
young
English
politician
who
had
said
all
the
things
that
Britain
's
trade
competitors
wanted
to
hear
.
The
Germans
had
got
their
priorities
right
.
Unlike
Britain
,
they
put
national
industrial
supremacy
first
and
foremost
.
European
interests
were
secondary
to
national
objectives
,
except
where
European
political
unity
carried
more
clout
in
the
international
political
scene
.
The
British
had
been
taken
to
the
cleaners
because
foolish
politicians
in
post-war
Britain
had
elected
to
produce
sociologists
instead
of
engineers
,
and
the
predictable
end
result
was
that
Britain
had
been
short
on
wealth
creators
and
long
on
spenders
.
The
creative
and
talented
nation
that
gave
birth
to
the
Industrial
Revolution
and
produced
more
inventions
and
patents
per
head
of
population
than
any
other
country
in
the
world
,
had
turned
its
back
on
industry
and
commerce
.
Mark
felt
bitter
and
sad
.
Sad
that
his
country
had
fallen
from
the
top
of
the
European
industrial
league
,
to
joint
eighth
out
of
nine
,
and
bitter
toward
the
foolish
leaders
who
had
been
largely
responsible
for
its
decline
.
The
supercilious
young
Minister
of
Trade
was
a
typical
product
of
the
British
post-war
school
of
Parliamentarians
whose
motto
should
have
been
"
words
not
deeds
"
.
In
the
eyes
of
such
politicians
,
industrial
managers
were
not
seen
as
the
creators
of
the
nation
's
wealth
,
and
the
providers
of
job
opportunities
for
the
people
,
but
as
despoilers
of
the
environment
;
obsolete
men
,
peddling
obsolete
views
,
who
did
n't
really
fit
in
with
the
new
social
scheme
of
things
.
They
were
yesterday
's
men
.
In
their
eyes
,
Mark
Sanders
was
such
a
man
.
When
Mark
arrived
home
there
were
two
letters
,
postmarked
Detroit
,
waiting
for
him
.
One
was
a
personal
letter
from
the
President
of
United
Motors
,
Nate
Cocello
,
thanking
him
for
his
services
to
the
Corporation
.
The
other
was
from
the
Vice
President
in
charge
of
Overseas
'
Operations
,
thanking
him
for
his
personal
contribution
to
the
expansion
of
European
Component
Operations
.
Mark
read
the
letters
twice
.
He
presumed
they
had
been
written
for
him
to
use
as
references
for
his
next
employer
,
but
he
tore
them
up
angrily
.
The
next
day
Muldoon
told
him
that
he
was
returning
to
the
States
at
the
end
of
the
month
to
take
his
enforced
early
retirement
,
after
a
short
holiday
on
the
Hamble
.
Mark
's
compensation
and
pension
terms
would
be
spelt
out
to
him
by
New
York
within
the
next
two
weeks
,
after
they
had
checked
out
the
maximum
terms
permissible
under
British
law
.
"
It
has
already
been
agreed
that
the
company
will
be
as
generous
as
British
law
allows
,
"
Muldoon
said
reassuringly
.
"
The
company
wish
you
to
know
,
Mark
,
from
Nate
Cocello
down
,
that
your
work
over
the
years
is
sincerely
appreciated
.
I
know
that
the
organisational
change
has
come
as
a
shock
to
you
,
as
it
has
for
me
,
but
we
want
to
part
company
after
all
these
years
,
on
the
best
and
friendliest
of
terms
.
I
am
assured
that
you
will
be
well
looked
after
,
"
he
reiterated
.
"
In
the
meantime
you
are
free
to
do
whatever
you
wish
to
do
over
the
next
few
weeks
.
If
we
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
in
finding
another
job
,
please
do
n't
hesitate
to
shout
.
No
doubt
you
will
wish
to
say
"
Goodbye
"
to
all
your
many
friends
and
colleagues
in
industry
and
Government
,
so
please
feel
free
to
do
so
in
whatever
way
you
feel
appropriate
.
"
Mark
nodded
.
"
Yes
,
sure
.
Thanks
.
"
he
replied
indifferently
.
The
big
,
soft
and
pliable
American
smiled
nervously
.
"
Oh
,
incidentally
Mark
,
I
understand
they
want
to
use
your
office
and
mine
for
a
couple
of
visiting
Americans
on
assignment
over
here
for
a
couple
of
months
.
Hope
you
have
n't
any
objection
.
You
can
use
the
Treasurer
's
office
until
you
leave
,
if
that
's
OK
by
you
?
He
's
on
vacation
.
"
Mark
nodded
.
"
Do
I
have
any
choice
in
the
matter
?
"
"
Sure
you
do
,
"
the
American
replied
.
But
he
did
n't
sound
certain
.
"
If
you
'd
rather
not
move
,
OK
.
I
'll
tell
'em
to
make
other
arrangements
in
the
interim
.
"
Mark
shook
his
head
.
"
No
.
I
'll
use
the
Treasurer
's
office
.
As
you
say
,
I
wo
n't
be
around
much
over
the
next
few
weeks
anyway
.
"
"
OK
,
Mark
.
I
'll
tell
'em
to
go
ahead
.
"
Mark
never
saw
Pat
Muldoon
again
.
The
American
cruised
the
Solent
for
a
few
days
while
Mark
was
tying
up
the
loose
ends
,
and
returned
to
the
States
without
paying
another
visit
to
his
office
.
He
slipped
into
the
obscurity
of
retirement
,
after
more
than
thirty
years
in
the
Corporation
,
in
much
the
same
way
as
he
had
operated
during
his
entire
working
life
:
unobtrusively
.
He
was
particularly
anxious
to
return
to
the
States
before
Mark
left
the
company
,
as
he
simply
could
n't
face
the
prospect
of
having
to
spell
out
to
the
Englishman
the
compensation
terms
and
pension
proposals
which
New
York
had
worked
out
.
Just
one
glance
had
told
Muldoon
that
they
were
very
far
from
being
as
generous
as
he
had
encouraged
Mark
to
believe
.
They
certainly
bore
no
relationship
to
the
eminently
satisfactory
compensation
and
pension
which
he
himself
would
receive
.
It
would
have
been
very
painful
for
Muldoon
to
have
to
pass
on
the
bad
news
,
so
he
decided
to
leave
for
the
States
and
let
the
Detroit
executive
personnel
Director
handle
Mark
's
affairs
.
True
to
form
,
Muldoon
simply
did
as
he
was
told
to
do
irrespective
of
the
rights
or
wrongs
of
the
decision
.
To
the
end
of
his
career
,
he
had
complete
faith
in
the
Corporation
and
in
the
infallibility
of
his
superiors
.
The
following
Sunday
Pat
Muldoon
stood
in
what
had
formerly
been
his
local
church
at
Gross
Pointe
,
Michigan
,
and
sang
to
the
heavens
,
"
If
I
can
help
somebody
,
as
I
go
along
,
then
my
living
will
not
be
in
vain
-
.
"
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
.
He
had
always
been
a
very
religious
man
,
which
had
helped
him
a
lot
in
the
Corporation
.
He
looked
around
the
congregation
and
saw
many
old
and
familiar
friends
and
colleagues
.
They
smiled
as
they
caught
his
eye
.
He
smiled
back
.
The
word
had
already
got
around
that
Pat
Muldoon
had
decided
to
take
retirement
in
his
old
familiar
surroundings
,
after
a
lifetime
s
dedicated
service
to
the
great
American
Corporation
.
People
liked
that
.
Pat
Muldoon
had
come
home
.
The
Director
of
Personnel
responsible
for
the
personal
affairs
of
overseas
executives
rang
Mark
from
Detroit
to
say
that
compensation
terms
had
now
been
worked
out
,
and
that
he
would
be
visiting
England
the
following
week
to
discuss
the
subject
with
him
.
"
Pat
sends
his
best
wishes
,
Mark
,
and
says
he
's
sorry
that
he
wo
n't
be
there
to
say
"
Goodbye
"
and
wish
you
luck
.
See
you
next
week
.
"
"
Yes
,
sure
.
Next
week
then
,
"
said
the
Englishman
.
The
union
meeting
at
the
Pier
Head
in
Liverpool
was
in
uproar
.
Fred
Clasper
had
shouted
himself
hoarse
in
his
frenzied
efforts
to
persuade
the
vociferous
gathering
of
several
thousand
employees
from
the
strike-bound
Merseyside
vehicle
plant
to
continue
the
strike
until
management
climbed
down
and
re-instated
the
sacked
shop
steward
.
He
was
being
heckled
,
jeered
and
booed
by
the
vast
majority
,
which
included
several
hundred
workers
who
had
driven
up
from
the
Midlands
'
plants
to
influence
the
vote
.
Clasper
's
small
hard
core
of
left-wing
supporters
,
which
included
a
phalanx
of
students
from
Liverpool
University
,
had
formed
a
noisy
group
immediately
in
front
of
the
improvised
platform
,
which
consisted
of
a
large
wooden
CKD
crate
with
the
Vehicle
Divisions
'
name
stencilled
in
large
black
letters
on
each
surface
.
Clasper
stood
alone
on
the
box
,
clasping
a
hand
microphone
to
his
ranting
mouth
.
The
vituperative
messages
which
poured
forth
in
a
veritable
torrent
of
abuse
were
repeatedly
drowned
by
the
dissenting
majority
who
kept
up
an
incessant
chant
:
"
Return
to
work
.
Return
to
work
.
Return
to
work
.
"
Clasper
screamed
back
at
the
chanting
mob
that
they
were
management
lackeys
who
had
been
conned
by
Peters
,
and
sold
down
the
river
by
Bunker
.
He
yelled
for
union
solidarity
to
support
the
strike
and
to
bring
management
to
their
knees
,
but
to
no
avail
.
His
members
had
had
enough
.
He
knew
that
he
was
now
powerless
to
influence
the
way
they
would
vote
.
He
had
underestimated
the
new
mood
of
his
members
who
had
become
sick
and
tired
of
the
never-ending
series
of
disputes
,
which
they
knew
in
their
consciences
had
been
driving
the
Division
ever
closer
to
bankruptcy
.
Clasper
was
stranded
.
He
had
missed
the
ebb
tide
.
Faced
with
the
stark
reality
of
a
choice
between
jobs
or
no
jobs
,
the
majority
had
elected
to
work
.
It
was
n't
a
straight
management
versus
union
dispute
;
it
was
job
preservation
.
The
unions
did
n't
pay
their
weekly
wages
;
the
company
did
.
They
would
support
the
union
if
they
thought
it
to
be
in
their
interest
to
do
so
.
They
would
not
back
the
union
in
a
political
fight
with
the
company
,
or
allow
themselves
to
be
used
by
Clasper
in
a
power
struggle
between
the
convener
and
management
.
If
it
was
a
question
of
company
survival
,
or
union
survival
,
the
company
would
always
win
.
"
Piss
off
,
Clasper
,
you
've
had
your
day
!
"
yelled
a
burly
figure
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
,
who
was
cheered
to
the
echo
for
his
advice
.
"
Go
home
,
you
bum
,
go
home
,
you
bum
,
go
home
,
you
bum
,
go
home
,
"
sang
another
to
the
tune
of
Auld
Lang
Syne
.
Within
seconds
,
the
sing-song
chant
had
been
taken
up
by
the
vast
majority
.
"
Go
home
,
you
bum
,
go
home
,
you
bum
,
go
home
,
you
bum
,
go
home
;
go
home
,
you
bum
,
go
home
you
bum
,
go
home
you
bum
,
go
home
.
"
Clasper
looked
out
at
the
sea
of
open
mouths
which
chorused
against
him
.
The
chants
were
now
accompanied
by
signs
as
one
member
after
another
thrust
a
right
arm
in
the
air
to
stab
a
pointing
finger
at
the
man
on
the
platform
.
"
Go
home
,
you
bum
,
go
home
you
bum
,
go
home
you
bum
,
go
home
;
go
home
you
bum
,
go
home
you
bum
,
go
home
you
bum
,
go
home
.
"
Clasper
yelled
back
at
the
chanting
mob
.
"
You
bloody
stupid
gits
!
You
bloody
sheep
!
You
arse
lickin'
lackeys
!
You
servile
scum
!
You
bloody
shits
-
.
"
He
was
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
into
the
microphone
but
save
for
a
few
at
the
front
of
the
crowd
,
nobody
could
hear
a
word
because
someone
had
cut
the
amplifier
cable
.
A
new
chant
was
now
taken
up
.
"
Clasper
out
.
Clasper
out
.
Clasper
out
-
.
"
followed
by
"
Return
to
work
.
Return
to
work
.
Return
to
work
.
"
Clasper
threw
the
useless
microphone
to
the
ground
and
thrust
a
rolled
up
newspaper
aloft
,
which
he
brandished
furiously
in
his
left
hand
.
Thumping
the
paper
with
his
other
hand
he
continued
to
yell
at
the
chanting
mob
,
but
could
n't
be
heard
above
the
din
.
In
disgust
he
threw
the
paper
into
the
crowd
.
Almost
by
return
,
he
was
hit
by
a
missile
which
looked
like
a
rotting
cabbage
.
Other
miscellaneous
missiles
rained
in
on
him
as
he
clambered
down
from
the
improvised
platform
with
the
help
of
his
small
band
of
left-wing
brothers
.
"
Dump
the
bastard
in
the
Mersey
!
"
yelled
a
high
pitched
voice
which
rose
above
the
chanting
mob
.
Within
seconds
a
new
cry
was
taken
up
.
"
Dump
the
bastard
in
the
Mersey
!
Dump
the
bastard
in
the
Mersey
!
Dump
the
bastard
in
the
Mersey
-
.
"
Hands
grasped
the
now
frightened
convener
as
his
mates
fought
to
keep
the
pressing
mob
at
bay
.
Overwhelmed
by
the
sheer
size
and
strength
of
the
surging
crowd
,
Clasper
's
supporters
suddenly
got
the
message
and
broke
rank
,
dispersing
into
the
milling
throng
.
Police
helmets
could
be
seen
bobbing
above
the
crowd
as
a
small
corps
of
police
officers
attempted
to
force
their
way
through
to
rescue
Clasper
from
the
hands
of
the
mob
.
Before
they
could
reach
him
,
however
,
he
was
borne
aloft
like
a
javelin
and
carried
to
the
quayside
a
few
yards
away
where
he
was
dumped
unceremoniously
into
the
murky
waters
to
a
great
cheer
from
those
who
were
close
enough
to
witness
the
event
.
Then
as
if
by
magic
the
crowd
melted
away
to
let
the
struggling
policemen
through
.
Clasper
was
soon
hauled
out
of
the
water
by
the
forces
of
law
and
order
,
something
he
had
never
bargained
for
in
a
lifetime
's
fight
against
them
.
Within
two
minutes
the
mob
had
completely
dispersed
,
with
the
exception
of
the
odd
copper
or
two
and
a
few
stragglers
who
were
loth
to
leave
the
scene
of
all
the
fun
.
One
of
them
picked
up
the
rolled
newspaper
which
Clasper
had
flung
into
the
crowd
.
"
I
would
n't
have
thought
The
Times
was
Clasper
's
favourite
paper
,
exactly
,
"
he
muttered
to
his
mate
.
"
Must
have
a
good
racing
correspondent
,
"
came
the

His
attention
was
drawn
to
a
red
circle
which
had
been
drawn
in
the
Business
Section
with
the
name
JUDAS
scrawled
in
large
block
capitals
.
He
read
out
loud
,
"
Mr
Clem
Bunker
,
regional
officer
of
the
Amalgamated
Union
of
Engineering
Workers

has
been
invited
to
serve

directorate

European
Commission

The

Prime
Minister

He
cuffed
his
mate
's
ear
with
the
paper
.
"
Well
,
stone
me
,
wack
,
"
he
chuckled
.
"
The
bastard
's
even
against
that

"
"
He
's
against
every
bloody
thing

replied
his
mate

"
Never

miserable

"
Back
at
cell
number
102
in
Kirkby
New
Town
,
Fred
Clasper
made
a
momentous
decision
to
emigrate
to
Australia
.
Well
it
's
fairly
obvious
that
you
ca
n't
go
back
to
the
plant
,
in
n
it
?
"
agreed
his
platinum
blonde
flatmate
Deirdre
.
"
Well
I
mean
to
say
-
it
stands
to
reason
like
-
do
n't
it
?
"
she
added
.
You
could
n't
do
that
now
,
could
yer
?
No
of
course
not
-
but
I
ai
n't
leavin'
Liverpool
to
chase
bloody
wallabies
.
I
like
it
"
ere
.
Well
,
it
's
'ome
like
,
where
all
yer
friends
are
,
in
n
it
?
,
She
put
her
nose
in
the
air
and
sniffed
.
"
Give
over
,
will
yer
,
"
pleaded
the
disconsolate
convener
,
slapping
jam
on
his
butty
.
"
Do
n't
you
ever
leave
off
?
"
"
No
well
-
I
should
n't
'ave
said
that
I
suppose
cos
you
ai
n't
got
no
friends
any
more
,
'ave
yer
?
Not
now
you
'ave
n't
-
even
if
you
'ad
some
before
they
dumped
you
in
the
Mersey
,
which
I
suppose
you
did
'ave
-
at
some
time
or
other
like
-
.
"
"
Aw
for
gawd
's
sake
give
that
bloody
tongue
of
yours
a
rest
will
yer
?
"
Clasper
sighed
.
"
I
'm
tryin'
to
think
-
believe
it
or
not
.
"
"
Well
,
do
n't
try
too
hard
,
luvvie
,
or
you
'll
burst
a
blood
vessel
,
"
she
called
above
the
noise
of
the
open
tap
as
she
filled
the
kettle
for
more
tea
.
She
sniffed
again
.
Fred
Clasper
was
a
malcontent
by
nature
,
one
of
the
curious
breed
who
are
never
happy
unless
they
are
miserable
.
But
discontent
was
one
thing
.
Helpless
misery
was
another
.
Now
,
briefly
,
possibly
for
the
very
first
time
in
his
life
,
he
felt
helpless
and
miserable
at
one
and
the
same
time
.
The
death
of
his
beloved
grandfather
had
brought
him
misery
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
had
also
given
him
strength
.
It
was
as
if
,
gasping
out
his
last
breath
,
that
battered
,
bitter
and
vindictive
old
man
had
somehow
injected
him
with
some
small
portion
of
his
own
bitter
resolve
.
That
was
both
why
and
how
he
had
fought
all
his
working
life
for
what
his
grandfather
had
believed
in
-
worker
control
of
the
means
of
production
and
distribution
,
and
the
establishment
of
a
Communist
society
where
means
were
related
to
needs
.
Now
after
twelve
years
as
convener
at
the
huge
Merseyside
plant
where
he
had
effectively
established
shop-floor
control
after
a
long
and
bitter
struggle
,
he
had
been
thrown
out
by
his
own
union
members
.
He
shook
his
head
sadly
at
the
cruel
injustices
of
this
world
.
"
Bloody
management-brainwashed
gits
,
"
he
muttered
.
"
What
's
that
,
Fred
luvvie
?
"
she
called
from
the
stove
.
"
Stupid
bastards
,
"
he
mumbled
on
.
"
Come
again
,
Fred
?
"
"
I
said
stupid
bastards
!
"
"
Well
I
like
that
-
that
's
rich
that
is
after
all
I
do
for
you
.
I
really
appreciate
that
,
Fred
-
I
really
do
.
I
cook
for
yer
and
I
keep
house
for
yer
and
all
that
-
and
that
's
the
thanks
I
get
,
well
thank
you
,
mate
.
"
She
sniffed
several
times
.
Deirdre
was
plainly
upset
and
would
have
droned
on
indefinitely
if
Fred
had
n't
shut
her
up
.
"
Aw
for
gawd
's
sake
shut
that
bloody
trap
of
yours
,
will
yer
?
I
was
n't
talkin'
to
you
.
I
was
thinkin'
out
loud
.
"
"
Oh
well
,
that
's
different
,
she
agreed
,
after
having
her
faith
restored
in
human
nature
.
"
But
you
might
apologise
.
"
"
Apologise
!
Apologise
!
What
the
bloody
hell
is
there
to
apologise
for
?
I
did
n't
call
you
a
stupid
bastard
,
did
I
?
"
he
yelled
in
exasperation
.
"
I
was
talkin'
about
those
bloody
stupid
gits
at
the
plant
,
was
n't
I
?
,
"
Well
,
yeah
,
but
they
do
n't
exactly
consider
you
to
be
the
greatest
thing
since
sliced
bread
,
now
do
they
?
"
she
opined
.
"
I
do
n't
care
what
they
bloody
well
think
.
Bloody
management
lackeys
-
that
's
what
they
are
-
scum
of
the
earth
-
.
"
"
Well
,
let's
have
another
cuppa
tea
,
luvvie
,
and
forget
all
about
it
-
it
's
not
worth
it
.
You
ai
n't
gon
na
change
the
world
no
matter
what
you
do
.
"
She
sniffed
again
.
He
took
the
steaming
beaker
from
his
flatmate
.
"
Well
,
are
yer
comin'
or
ai
n't
yer
?
"
he
asked
after
a
long
and
noisy
sip
at
the
cup
that
cheers
.
"
Coming
where
?
"
she
asked
.
"
Bloody
Australia
,
of
course
.
Where
the
hell
do
you
think
?
"
"
Oh
,
Australia
-
.
Do
you
really
want
me
to
come
?
,
"
Course
I
do
or
I
would
n't
have
bloody
well
asked
yer
,
would
I
?
"
"
Why
Australia
?
"
she
asked
,
breathing
on
her
recently
painted
nails
.
"
Cause
that
's
where
the
bloody
new
action
is
gon
na
be
,
"
he
replied
testily
.
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
"
she
asked
with
an
air
of
surprise
.
"
Cause
I
bloody
well
know
.
I
'm
in
the
movement
,
ai
n't
I
?
,
"
Well
yes
I
know
-
but
Aussie
land
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
ai
n't
it
?
"
"
So
what
!
Bloody
United
Motors
is
not
the
only
one
to
have
a
bloody
world-wide
corporate
plan
.
"
"
Australia
-
.
"
she
toyed
with
the
name
.
"
Well
-
be
a
change
I
suppose
-
and
we
do
get
along
very
well
,
do
n't
we
,
Fred
?
"
She
sniffed
and
went
on
sniffing
.
The
Pier
Head
incident
proved
to
be
the
turning
point
which
led
to
a
new
period
of
industrial
peace
within
the
giant
Vehicle
Division
,
unfortunately
too
late
to
avoid
the
massive
investment
switch
to
the
Continent
which
was
already
under
way
with
the
newly
approved
corporate
plan
.
Wholesale
changes
took
place
within
the
management
and
trade
union
organisations
,
with
the
good
going
out
with
the
bad
.
The
convener
who
replaced
Clasper
,
for
example
,
at
the
Merseyside
plant
,
was
elected
because
he
had
stressed
to
the
union
membership
that
the
best
way
he
could
serve
their
interest
was
to
help
make
sure
that
the
Merseyside
plant
became
the
most
efficient
plant
in
Europe
.
"
We
know
from
past
experience
where
the
other
route
takes
us
,
"
he
said
to
loud
applause
.
"
Downhill
to
the
Labour
Exchange
at
the
bottom
.
From
here
on
in
we
are
going
to
be
winners
,
not
losers
.
For
years
we
have
been
a
low
productivity
low-wage
plant
and
we
have
ended
up
losing
our
jobs
and
all
the
new
investment
opportunities
.
From
here
on
we
aim
to
be
a
high-productivity
high-wage
plant
.
That
's
the
best
way
I
know
to
protect
the
jobs
of
our
members
.
"
Sadly
for
Britain
,
sadly
for
industrial
peace
on
Merseyside
,
the
change-of-heart
had
come
too
late
.
Plants
closed
,
men
were
sacked
,
industrial
decay
and
unemployment
spread
like
a
leprous
blight
across
the
whole
of
the
region
and
insidiously
crept
down
into
the
Midlands
.
Fred
Clasper
may
have
moved
on
to
a
new
fighting
ground
but
he
,
and
men
like
him
,
left
behind
their
destructive
trade-mark
on
Britain
for
more
than
a
decade
.
Mark
could
n't
believe
his
eyes
and
ears
when
the
American
Director
of
Overseas
'
Executive
Personnel
spelt
out
the
compensation
terms
under
the
early
retirement
deal
.
He
was
to
be
given
two
weeks
salary
for
each
year
of
service
.
This
would
give
him
eighteen
months
'
salary
as
compensation
for
loss
of
office
,
and
his
pension
was
not
to
begin
until
the
eighteen
month
period
had
elapsed
.
Mark
's
face
hardened
into
an
expression
of
bitter
hatred
.
He
had
been
deeply
hurt
twice
before
by
the
Corporation
,
but
this
last
kick
in
the
stomach
on
final
departure
was
the
last
straw
.
He
flung
the
contract
at
the
feet
of
the
American
.
"
You
call
these
terms
generous
?
"
he
demanded
angrily
.
"
I
call
it
a
bloody
insult
!
,
The
American
was
visibly
shaken
by
the
Englishman
's
angry
response
.
"
Sorry
you
feel
that
way
about
it
,
Mark
.
You
can
keep
the
company
car
,
"
he
added
quickly
.
"
You
sure
the
Corporation
can
afford
it
?
"
Mark
asked
sarcastically
.
"
What
did
Muldoon
say
?
"
he
added
sharply
.
"
Waal
,
"
said
the
American
,
"
there
was
nothing
much
he
could
say
,
was
there
?
Rules
is
rules
,
after
all
.
"
"
That
's
right
,
is
n't
it
?
"
Mark
scoffed
.
"
He
would
n't
say
much
would
he
!
He
's
all
right
Jack
!
He
's
got
two
thirds
of
a
bloody
great
American
salary
four
times
greater
than
mine
for
doing
similar
work
.
That
gives
him
a
pension
nearly
ten
times
greater
than
the
one
I
've
got
.
I
'm
not
surprised
he
did
n't
say
much
.
Who
the
hell
would
want
to
rock
the
boat
on
a
deal
like
that
!
Do
YOU
think
that
's
fair
?
"
he
shouted
angrily
.
"
But
you
're
not
an
American
,
Mark
.
You
're
an
Englishman
-
.
"
"
So
-
.
"
"
So
bullshit
!
"
Mark
exploded
.
"
I
've
been
an
Overseas
"
Corporation
Executive
for
the
last
ten
years
and
I
've
always
been
told
that
the
reason
the
Corporation
could
n't
pay
me
the
salary
it
paid
to
Americans
doing
similar
work
was
because
my
salary
had
to
be
related
to
British
salary
scales
.
"
"
Yeah
,
that
's
right
.
That
's
Corporation
rules
.
"
"
So
why
am
I
not
being
compensated
for
loss
of
office
according
to
British
scales
?
,
"
What
's
that
?
"
Mark
said
clearly
,
"
Accepted
British
practice
is
at
least
one
month
's
salary
for
each
year
of
service
.
And
pension
rights
begin
immediately
,
not
at
the
end
of
any
bloody
eighteen
month
period
.
And
that
's
for
run-of-the-mill
managers
.
For
executives
there
is
virtually
no
limit
.
"
The
American
shook
his
head
worriedly
.
"
I
'm
sorry
,
Mark
,
but
Corporation
rules
are
rules
.
The
Corporation
ca
n't
make
an
exception
in
your
case
.
"
Mark
smashed
a
fist
on
the
desk
in
a
defiant
gesture
.
"
You
've
been
making
a
bloody
exception
in
my
case
ever
since
I
've
been
on
the
corporate
payroll
"
he
yelled
.
"
Some
bloody
rules
!
One
for
Americans
.
Another
for
the
rest
of
us
.
"
Mark
moved
angrily
toward
the
door
.
He
had
had
enough
.
"
I
'll
take
it
up
with
higher
authority
,
if
that
's
what
you
want
,
"
said
the
American
nervously
.
"
I
could
bring
your
views
to
the
attention
of
the
Vice
President
in
charge
of
Overseas
Operations
"
he
added
placatingly
.
Mark
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
sarcastically
.
"
You
'd
never
keep
Jupe
awake
long
enough
to
listen
to
the
arguments
.
Ye
gods
,
even
when
he
is
awake
all
he
ever
says
is
let's
sleep
on
it
-
.
"
The
American
smiled
at
the
accurate
description
of
the
Vice
President
whose
reputation
for
always
falling
asleep
at
meetings
had
earned
him
the
nickname
of
Mogadon
Man
.
"
But
I
will
speak
to
Jupe
if
you
would
like
me
to
do
so
,
"
he
replied
.
"
Ca
n't
do
any
harm
.
But
I
do
n't
think
it
would
do
any
good
.
"
Mark
jerked
the
door
open
and
turned
to
face
the
American
eyes
hardened
with
anger
.
"
Yes
,
maybe
that
's
not
a
bad
suggestion
,
"
he
said
slowly
and
deliberately
.
"
Speak
to
Jupe
by
all
means
on
my
behalf
.
Tell
him
to
stuff
it
up
his
arse
.
"
On
returning
to
his
office
the
following
Monday
,
Mark
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
now
occupied
by
visiting
American
auditors
.
"
Could
n't
you
wait
for
the
body
to
be
removed
?
"
he
said
quietly
.
The
two
Americans
leapt
to
their
feet
.
"
Sorry
,
Mr
Sanders
.
"
It
was
the
older
man
,
who
had
been
occupying
Mark
's
large
black
leather
chair
,
who
spoke
.
"
We
were
n't
expecting
you
back
.
We
were
told
you
were
using
the
Treasurer
s
office
.
Do
you
want
us
to
leave
?
,
"
No
,
"
Mark
said
with
a
sigh
.
"
No
,
do
n't
bother
.
I
knew
you
were
coming
.
Sooner
than
I
thought
.
"
"
Your
secretary
organised
the
transfer
of
files
and
your
personal
things
,
"
the
other
American
said
.
Mark
nodded
.
"
Fine
"
he
said
,
reflecting
on
the
finality
of
the
situation
.
"
Then
I
'll
leave
you
to
it
.
"
And
he
walked
out
of
his
office
for
the
very
last
time
.
The
Treasurer
's
room
was
all
dark
teak
furniture
and
the
walls
were
hung
with
portraits
of
the
top
men
in
the
Corporation
,
unlike
the
walls
of
Mark
's
office
which
were
covered
with
coloured
aerial
photographs
of
the
many
European
component
plants
which
had
come
within
his
planning
responsibility
.
Flanking
the
portrait
of
the
Chairman
,
Tom
O'Reilly
,
were
those
of
the
President
and
Chief
Executive
officer
,
Nate
Cocello
,
the
Head
of
Overseas
'
Operations
,
Mogadon
Man
,
the
General
Director
,
Europe
,
Clancy
McGillicuddy
,
and
Pat
Muldoon
as
Regional
Manager
of
European
Component
Operations
.
Mark
was
one
level
below
Muldoon
,
so
his
portrait
did
n't
make
it
among
the
VIPs
.
"
Thanks
,
Pat
,
"
he
said
sardonically
,
nodding
at
Muldoon
's
picture
.
"
Hope
I
can
do
the
same
for
you
some
day
.
"
He
sat
on
the
top
of
the
large
expanse
of
teak
desk
and
stared
coldly
at
the
men
who
had
made
it
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
biggest
corporations
in
the
world
,
employing
nearly
one
million
people
.
A
bitter
smile
crossed
his
face
as
his
eyes
ranged
over
the
top
men
in
the
giant
corporation
.
He
picked
up
the
correspondence
and
miscellaneous
papers
in
the
in-tray
and
quickly
scanned
the
contents
.
OECD
reports
,
technical
journals
,
but
no
reports
of
future
European
Planning
Committee
meetings
in
Geneva
,
or
Paris
,
Lisbon
,
Rome
or
Madrid
,
and
no
minutes
of
previous
Planning
meetings
with
resolutions
which
called
for
immediate
action
.
Nor
were
there
file
copies
of
his
reports
to
the
top
brass
on
the
European
Business
Plan
,
or
copies
of
the
vehicle
divisions
,
plan
for
the
private
and
confidential
attention
of
Mark
Sanders
.
He
was
already
struck
off
the
circulation
list
and
would
soon
be
off
the
payroll
.
He
looked
around
the
room
.
None
of
the
four
phones
would
ring
if
he
remained
at
the
desk
all
day
.
The
white
,
hot
line
certainly
would
n't
.
He
was
a
redundant
executive
and
nobody
rang
a
redundant
executive
,
except
to
say
"
Goodbye
"
.
He
opened
the
door
which
led
to
the
secretary
's
annex
.
Her
chair
was
empty
and
would
remain
empty
until
he
left
the
company
.
The
electric
typewriter
was
covered
by
its
hood
and
would
remain
covered
while
he
was
still
there
.
There
was
just
no
point
in
remaining
on
the
premises
when
you
knew
you
had
to
go
,
as
Muldoon
had
said
.
It
was
too
painful
.
"
Use
the
remaining
few
weeks
to
say
your
goodbyes
and
to
find
another
job
,
"
he
had
said
.
Mark
smiled
the
bitter
smile
of
a
disillusioned
corporate
executive
and
walked
out
of
the
office
,
closing
the
door
slowly
and
carefully
behind
him
.
Two
days
later
,
Mark
arrived
back
at
his
temporary
office
to
check
the
in-tray
and
tie
up
any
loose
ends
.
To
his
annoyance
he
found
that
the
Treasurer
's
office
was
now
completely
empty
except
for
the
four
telephones
set
down
in
a
row
on
the
bare
boards
of
the
floor
.
Even
the
carpet
had
been
removed
.
He
shook
his
head
sadly
.
Could
n't
they
have
waited
just
another
couple
of
weeks
until
he
had
officially
retired
at
the
end
of
the
month
?
Nothing
surprised
him
any
more
.
He
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
walked
slowly
down
the
corridor
until
he
reached
the
top
of
the
marble
staircase
,
passing
his
own
office
and
Pat
Muldoon
's
without
wishing
to
take
a
last
look
.
For
one
brief
moment
he
paused
to
reflect
on
the
finality
of
this
his
last
visit
which
closed
a
thirty
year
chapter
of
his
life
;
then
with
a
wry
smile
he
descended
the
impressive
stairway
.
He
was
glad
he
was
getting
out
.
Glad
,
glad
,
glad
.
For
the
first
time
in
years
he
felt
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
truly
free
man
.
Mark
crossed
the
imposing
entrance
hall
and
went
out
for
the
last
time
.
At
home
that
evening
,
Georgina
asked
Mark
if
he
had
any
future
plans
he
wished
to
discuss
with
her
.
"
What
will
you
do
,
darling
?
"
she
asked
affectionately
.
"
No
,
sweetheart
.
It
's
not
what
will
I
do
.
It
's
what
will
WE
do
?
"
he
replied
,
rising
from
his
chair
to
kiss
her
lightly
on
the
forehead
on
his
way
to
the
Scotch
decanter
.
"
Yes
,
of
course
,
darling
.
That
's
what
I
meant
to
say
.
"
What
will
WE
do
?
"
"
Well
,
I
thought
we
might
take
a
holiday
in
Canada
,
"
Mark
said
.
"
Vancouver
Island
and
the
Rockies
.
We
do
n't
have
to
rush
.
We
've
got
all
the
time
in
the
world
.
"
"
That
would
be
marvellous
.
Just
the
two
of
us
with
nothing
else
to
think
about
but
each
other
for
a
few
weeks
.
Ca
n't
think
of
anything
nicer
.
But
what
about
after
that
?
"
"
We
'll
talk
about
that
later
,
"
Mark
said
,
sipping
his
Scotch
thoughtfully
.
"
Maybe
I
'll
write
a
book
and
then
take
up
that
offer
to
have
a
go
for
the
European
Parliament
.
"
Tom
O'Neill
came
through
the
revolving
doors
on
a
blast
of
icy
air
and
stepped
out
on
the
other
side
into
a
blanket
of
almost
oppressive
warmth
.
Outside
London
might
be
shivering
in
the
biting
cold
of
a
January
morning
,
here
in
the
foyer
of
the
British
and
Cosmopolitan
Insurance
building
centrally
heated
air
oozed
steadily
from
a
series
of
concealed
vents
to
waft
summer
warmth
into
every
corner
.
Tom
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
,
fished
in
the
pocket
of
the
dark
suit
which
he
scathingly
referred
to
as
his
"
city
uniform
"
for
his
identity
card
and
flashed
it
at
the
uniformed
security
man
.
He
did
not
like
wearing
suits
and
he
liked
a
collar
and
tie
even
less
.
He
was
far
more
at
home
in
jeans
and
a
sweater
or
the
favourite
scuffed
old
flying
jacket
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
,
who
had
been
a
Spitfire
pilot
in
the
war
and
he
wore
them
whenever
he
could
.
Occasionally
his
job
as
a
private
insurance
investigator
allowed
him
this
privilege
but
there
were
occasions
which
called
for
him
to
dress
more
formally
.
Visiting
the
Head
Office
of
one
of
the
companies
that
used
his
services
in
response
to
an
urgent
summons
was
one
of
them
.
Without
waiting
for
his
nod
and
wave
Tom
strode
past
the
security
man
to
the
block
of
six
lifts
beyond
him
.
One
had
just
arrived
at
ground
floor
level
;
Tom
followed
two
girl
clerks
into
it
and
pressed
the
button
for
the
fifteenth
floor
.
He
felt
rather
than
saw
the
two
girls
glance
at
him
appraisingly
but
took
no
notice
.
At
just
over
six
foot
,
with
thick
curling
brown
hair
and
eyes
that
owed
their
startling
blueness
to
his
Irish
ancestry
,
Tom
was
used
to
being
the
object
of
female
appreciation
whilst
being
slightly
puzzled
by
it
.
He
had
never
thought
the
reflection
which
looked
back
at
him
each
morning
from
the
shaving
mirror
was
particularly
handsome
.
His
nose
was
too
large
and
a
little
crooked
since
taking
a
devastating
straight
left
in
the
boxing
ring
when
he
was
fifteen
years
old
,
his
chin
too
irregular
.
But
women
certainly
seemed
to
like
it
and
that
of
course
had
its
compensations
.
Tom
had
not
reached
the
ripe
old
age
of
twenty-nine
without
discovering
quite
a
few
of
them
.
The
lift
halted
at
the
twelfth
floor
for
the
girls
to
get
out
,
then
whispered
on
towards
the
fifteenth
.
When
the
doors
opened
again
Tom
emerged
into
a
corridor
,
thickly
carpeted
in
grey
.
Like
the
twelfth
floor
,
glimpsed
through
the
lift
doors
when
the
girls
had
got
out
,
the
walls
were
covered
with
a
pale
lemon
wash
,
unlike
the
twelfth
they
were
hung
with
pictures
,
not
Old
Masters
but
not
Boots
the
chemists
either
-
prints
of
hunting
scenes
and
ships
and
a
beautiful
soft
sunset
over
a
bay
that
might
have
been
St
Ives
-
pictures
deemed
suitable
for
the
Executive
floor
of
a
great
international
company
.
Tom
passed
them
by
without
a
glance
,
heading
for
the
door
at
the
very
end
of
the
corridor
.
He
knocked
briskly
and
without
waiting
for
a
bidding
went
in
.
The
secretary
seated
behind
the
desk
in
the
outer
office
looked
up
accusingly
,
then
her
features
softened
and
a
faint
pink
flush
coloured
her
cheeks
.
"
Tom
!
"
"
Morning
,
Lucy
.
I
understand
the
Great
White
Chief
wants
to
see
me
.
"
"
That
's
right
,
he
does
.
I
'll
buzz
him
.
"
She
depressed
the
button
.
"
Mr
O'Neill
is
here
,
Mr
Swansborough
.
"
She
glanced
up
at
Tom
,
a
little
regretfully
.
"
He
says
to
go
straight
in
,
Tom
.
"
Tom
nodded
.
"
Thanks
.
"
Watching
him
disappear
into
the
inner
sanctum
,
Lucy
sighed
.
Why
was
it
the
gorgeous
ones
passed
through
so
fleetingly
while
others
,
like
that
paunchy
,
moist-palmed
Vic
Tatum
from
Marine
Claims
always
managed
to
delay
in
her
office
,
ogling
,
leering
and
making
suggestive
remarks
that
she
could
probably
take
to
a
Sexual
Harassment
Tribunal
if
she
had
a
mind
to
!
"
Come
in
,
Tom
,
come
in
!
"
Roger
Swansborough
half
rose
from
his
executive
chair
holding
out
his
hand
in
greeting
.
He
was
a
big
bluff
man
with
a
receding
hairline
and
aggressively
triple
chin
which
somehow
managed
to
make
him
look
powerful
but
not
fat
-
like
a
back
row
rugby
player
,
Tom
thought
.
He
had
already
removed
his
jacket
in
the
cloying
warmth
of
the
office
but
his
white
shirt
was
immaculate
and
as
he
reached
across
the
desk
Tom
caught
the
gleam
of
gold
cufflinks
against
the
stiff
white
cuffs
.
"
I
had
a
message
that
you
wanted
to
see
me
urgently
,
"
Tom
said
.
"
That
's
right
.
Take
your
coat
off
,
Tom
,
do
.
This
place
gets
hotter
every
day
.
I
'd
open
a
window
but
-
"
He
gesticulated
towards
the
expanse
of
glass
that
surrounded
the
office
on
two
sides
.
Beyond
it
the
sky
was
lowering
grey
,
shrouding
the
roofs
of
the
buildings
and
filtering
cold
dull
half-light
onto
the
streets
and
the
distant
river
.
From
up
here
on
the
fifteenth
floor
the
view
was
a
panoramic
one
-
unfortunately
this
morning
it
was
also
infinitely
depressing
.
Tom
did
as
he
was
bid
,
hanging
his
coat
on
the
heavy
carved
stand
behind
the
door
.
"
What
's
going
on
then
,
Roger
?
Who
's
trying
to
swindle
you
this
time
?
"
he
asked
smiling
wryly
-
his
job
had
made
him
cynical
.
The
older
man
grimaced
.
"
Not
trying
to
swindle
us
,
Tom
.
This
time
it
's
a
fait
accompli
-
a
bloody
great
sting
to
make
your
eyes
water
.
Take
a
look
at
that
.
"
A
copy
of
the
morning
paper
was
lying
on
his
tooled
leather
desk
top
;
he
pushed
it
across
to
Tom
,
stabbing
at
the
story
with
a
manicured
index
finger
.
"
You
remember
the
Martin
business
?
No
,
you
would
n't
,
of
course
.
It
happened
twenty
years
ago
,
when
you
were
still
in
short
trousers
.
A
luxury
cabin
cruiser
blew
up
off
the
coast
of
Italy
.
There
were
two
people
aboard
-
Greg
Martin
,
the
owner
,
a
financier
with
a
finger
in
more
pies
than
you
'd
care
to
name
,
and
a
woman
,
Paula
Varna
,
wife
of
Hugo
Varna
the
fashion
designer
.
The
boat
was
blown
to
glory
,
nothing
was
ever
found
of
it
except
for
a
few
bits
of
debris
,
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
both
occupants
were
blown
to
glory
with
it
.
"
"
British
and
Cosmopolitan
were
the
insurers
,
I
presume
.
"
"
Too
right
.
Not
only
the
boat
but
the
lives
of
both
Martin
and
Paula
Varna
-
not
peanut
policies
either
of
them
as
you
can
imagine
.
She
had
been
a
top
model
-
her
legs
alone
were
insured
for
a
five
figure
sum
and
he
had
enough
hanging
on
him
to
bankrupt
a
smaller
company
.
No
,
1970
was
not
a
good
year
for
British
and
Cosmopolitan
what
with
one
thing
and
the
other
.
But
that
's
our
business
,
taking
risks
,
and
it
works
well
enough
-
as
long
as
everyone
plays
by
the
rules
.
"
"
And
this
time
someone
did
n't
?
"
Tom
asked
.
He
was
trying
to
read
the
newspaper
upside
down
without
much
success
.
Roger
Swansborough
's
hand
balled
into
a
fist
and
he
brought
it
slamming
down
onto
the
desk
top
so
that
loose
paperclips
jumped
in
the
big
crystal
ashtray
.
"
Too
right
they
did
n't
.
We
paid
out
on
the
life
of
Greg
Martin
-
and
it
seems
the
bastard
was
n't
dead
at
all
but
living
a
life
of
luxury
in
Australia
.
"
Tom
whistled
softly
.
"
For
twenty
years
?
Are
you
sure
it
's
him
?
"
"
It
's
him
all
right
.
He
's
been
living
in
Sydney
under
an
assumed
name
-
Michael
Trafford
-
with
an
Italian
heiress
named
Maria
Vincenti
.
He
was
part
Italian
himself
,
of
course
-
I
understand
his
name
was
Martino
originally
until
he
decided
to
drop
the
"
o
"
and
Americanise
it
to
Martin
.
But
he
was
an
American
citizen
,
born
in
the
States
as
far
as
I
can
make
out
.
"
"
So
why
was
he
insured
with
the
British
and
Cosmopolitan
?
"
Tom
asked
.
Swansborough
shrugged
.
"
You
tell
me
.
I
dare
say
the
slippery
bastard
had
a
good
reason
.
He
left
a
fair
old
mess
behind
him
,
by
the
way
,
when
he
disappeared
.
He
'd
been
sailing
close
to
the
wind
for
years
and
everything
was
just
about
to
blow
up
in
his
face
.
"
Tom
reached
for
the
newspaper
,
turning
it
towards
him
.
He
scanned
the
print
,
seeing
that
it
echoed
more
or
less
exactly
the
story
Swansborough
had
just
told
him
,
then
turned
his
attention
to
the
photograph
alongside
-
three
people
,
obviously
dressed
for
leisure
.
A
thin-faced
man
,
balding
,
in
a
shirt
open
at
the
neck
to
reveal
gold
chains
,
a
woman
,
obviously
beautiful
in
spite
of
the
quality
of
the
photograph
,
with
her
hair
tied
under
a
scarf
Princess
Grace
style
,
and
another
man
with
a
look
of
the
Mediterranean
about
him
whose
face
was
partially
obscured
by
sunglasses
.
"
That
's
Greg
Martin
?
"
Tom
asked
,
pointing
to
the
third
figure
.
"
Yes
.
With
Hugo
Varna
and
Paula
-
on
another
trip
which
presumably
did
not
end
in
disaster
,
"
Swansborough
said
drily
.
"
They
were
quite
a
part
of
the
international
scene
in
those
days
from
what
I
can
make
out
.
Since
he
's
made
his
fortune
Varna
has
become
something
of
a
recluse
,
of
course
.
In
fact
there
are
those
who
claim
he
never
got
over
his
wife
's
death
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
married
again
-
Paula
's
younger
sister
,
Sally
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
.
"
"
Hmm
.
"
Tom
studied
the
photograph
.
"
Well
,
quite
obviously
Mrs
Varna
was
a
real
stunner
.
And
she
was
alone
on
the
boat
with
Martin
when
the
accident
happened
.
Something
going
on
there
,
was
there
?
"
"
Varna
insisted
not
at
the
time
.
Said
his
wife
had
been
in
need
of
a
holiday
and
he
had
been
unable
to
get
away
.
Martin
was
a
close
friend
of
the
family
as
well
as
his
business
partner
and
Varna
had
been
happy
for
her
to
go
with
him
.
But
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
.
She
was
English
,
by
the
way
,
which
could
explain
why
they
chose
to
insure
with
us
.
"
"
A
doubtful
honour
,
the
way
things
turned
out
,
"
Tom
said
drily
.
"
So
-
British
and
Cosmopolitan
was
taken
for
a
small
fortune
-
and
taken
for
fools
too
by
the
seem
of
it
.
How
the
hell
did
it
happen
?
The
accident
was
investigated
at
the
time
,
you
say
?
"
"
Of
course
it
was
-
and
damned
thoroughly
too
as
you
can
see
.
"
Swansborough
tapped
the
file
in
front
of
him
and
Tom
saw
the
thick
wad
of
papers
which
protruded
from
it
.
"
But
there
was
nothing
we
could
get
our
teeth
into
.
The
boat
had
gone
,
not
a
doubt
of
it
.
Fishermen
reported
hearing
the
explosion
and
bits
of
debris
were
washed
up
for
months
afterwards
.
There
appeared
to
be
no
survivors
and
there
were
plenty
of
witnesses
to
swear
both
Greg
Martin
and
Paula
Varna
were
on
board
when
the
yacht
sailed
-
Martin
was
well
known
at
the
marina
where
he
kept
her
and
Paula
was
a
highly
visible
character
.
"
He
smiled
thinly
.
"
The
papers
treated
it
all
as
a
great
tragedy
as
you
'll
see
when
you
look
at
them
.
Financier
and
former
model
die
in
mystery
explosion
was
the
headline
at
the
time
-
and
the
emphasis
of
course
was
on
the
"
former
model
"
.
Beautiful
woman
,
internationally
known
,
wife
of
talented
fashion
designer
-
it
was
heaven-sent
copy
,
especially
for
the
more
sensational
press
.
And
she
was
a
mother
too
-
she
and
Varna
had
a
child
-
a
little
girl
who
was
about
four
at
the
time
.
You
can
imagine
the
story
it
made
.
"
Tom
nodded
.
"
I
certainly
can
.
So
it
would
n't
have
just
been
insurance
investigators
ferreting
about
-
it
would
have
been
the
world
's
press
as
well
.
But
in
spite
of
the
way
it
looked
Martin
had
faked
his
own
death
-
and
done
it
damned
successfully
.
And
what
about
the
woman
-
Paula
Varna
?
Did
British
and
Cosmopolitan
also
fork
out
a
small
fortune
to
her
family
to
which
they
were
not
entitled
?
Her
family
were
the
beneficiaries
,
I
suppose
.
Did
she
die
-
or
is
she
,
too
,
still
living
somewhere
under
an
assumed
name
?
"
Swansborough
closed
the
file
with
a
snap
and
pushed
it
across
the
desk
.
"
That
,
Tom
is
what
I
want
you
to
find
out
.
"
In
a
corner
of
the
Salon
Imperial
of
the
Hotel
Intercontinental
,
Paris
,
Harriet
Varna
braced
her
back
against
a
statuesque
pillar
and
looked
steadily
into
the
viewfinder
of
her
camera
,
concentrating
on
her
subjects
so
fiercely
that
she
was
almost
oblivious
to
the
electric
atmosphere
that
surrounded
her
,
bouncing
off
the
Viennese
decor
and
the
sumptuous
rococo
ceiling
along
with
the
heat
and
the
light
as
the
models
of
the
House
of
Saint
Laurent
moved
gracefully
along
the
hundred
yards
of
catwalk
to
display
the
new
season
's
couture
collection
.
Only
the
constant
clicking
of
the
camera
shutters
of
the
army
of
photographers
and
the
intermittent
bursts
of
rapturous
applause
broke
the
expectant
hush
that
January
afternoon
,
for
Yves
Saint
Laurent
is
one
of
the
few
important
couturiers
to
show
in
the
old
manner
,
with
no
mood-setting
background
music
.
In
the
late
sixties
he
had
declared
"
Couture
is
dead
!
"
and
concentrated
instead
on
off-the-peg
designer
wear
,
but
twenty
years
later
his
revival
had
been
both
stunning
and
nostalgic
and
the
long-term
wealthy
and
the
nouveau
riche
had
come
flocking
,
craving
the
glamour
and
excitement
,
and
seeking
the
prestige
that
comes
from
owning
a
couture
gown
,
specially
,
individually
theirs
after
hours
of
masochistic
fittings
.
Now
they
sat
eagerly
on
the
rows
of
brittle
gilt
chairs
with
red
velvet
seats
,
their
exquisitely
made-up
faces
carefully
devoid
of
expression
as
they
made
brief
notes
on
their
programmes
,
pretending
not
to
notice
that
sometimes
the
clicking
cameras
were
directed
not
at
the
catwalk
models
,
all
of
whom
had
already
done
a
photo-call
session
for
the
photographers
the
previous
day
,
but
at
them
-
the
society
women
of
America
and
the
international
circuit
,
the
bored
charity
conscious
wives
of
big
businessmen
,
the
famed
actresses
of
stage
and
screen
,
even
the
occasional
European
princess
.
The
actresses
,
of
course
,
were
frequently
loaned
gowns
by
the
house
free
of
charge
for
the
publicity
that
would
be
gained
when
they
were
pictured
wearing
them
,
and
there
were
those
among
the
society
women
who
considered
themselves
above
coming
to
the
couture
,
ordering
instead
from
the
videos
that
nowadays
replaced
the
weeks
of
shows
of
the
old
days
-
and
staying
away
all
the
more
determinedly
as
the
great
Paris
houses
vied
with
one
another
to
tempt
them
to
lend
their
presence
to
the
occasion
.
But
there
were
plenty
of
beautiful
and
recognisable
faces
to
be
seen
amongst
the
anonymous
,
but
none-the-less
powerful
,
fashion
editors
,
still
enough
buying
power
in
this
room
alone
to
rock
empires
,
even
if
no
house
made
a
profit
from
the
couture
but
rather
used
it
for
a
loss-leading
advertisement
and
a
mark
of
prestige
.
It
was
at
none
of
these
that
Harriet
's
camera
was
trained
,
however
.
Instead
her
zoom
lens
was
pointed
at
the
rear
of
the
salon
where
the
apprentices
and
publicity
girls
stood
in
small
,
highly-strung
huddles
,
watching
the
gowns
they
had
worked
on
and
publicised
pass
by
on
the
catwalk
and
leading
the
explosions
of
rapturous
applause
.
There
was
one
girl
in
particular
who
interested
Harriet
,
a
small
girl
with
hair
cut
gamin
short
,
whose
face
was
so
expressive
that
it
seemed
to
reflect
every
one
of
the
emotions
that
they
were
all
feeling
,
these
midinettes
who
had
basted
hemlines
and
stitched
hooks
and
eyes
into
place
,
positioned
trimmings
and
sewed
them
into
place
with
such
tiny
stitches
that
they
were
all
but
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
.
Harriet
hardly
dared
blink
as
she
watched
her
through
the
viewfinder
,
terrified
she
might
miss
the
moment
she
was
waiting
for
.
Then
,
as
a
daring
but
romantic
gown
of
navy
blue
silk
crepe
made
its
appearance
,
the
moment
came
.
The
girl
's
face
came
alive
,
eyes
sparkling
,
hands
raised
to
her
parted
lips
in
an
expression
halfway
between
exultation
and
tears
of
joy
,
before
she
began
to
clap
furiously
.
Swiftly
Harriet
depressed
the
button
again
and
again
.
Perfect
-
perfect
!
That
was
what
she
had
been
waiting
for
,
that
unguarded
,
unforced
,
totally
natural
reaction
of
a
lowly
apprentice
who
sees
her
work
unfold
like
a
fairytale
.
In
a
world
where
so
much
was
staged
artificially
it
was
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
Harriet
experienced
her
very
own
glow
of
excitement
and
triumph
.
For
a
minute
or
two
longer
she
panned
the
camera
,
too
much
the
professional
to
allow
her
pleasure
to
make
her
risk
missing
another
good
shot
.
But
instinctively
she
knew
she
had
what
she
wanted
-
the
frames
that
would
lend
just
the
breadth
and
depth
she
needed
to
complete
her
picture
story
of
the
couture
shows
,
and
she
let
her
camera
fall
back
on
its
strap
around
her
neck
,
rubbing
her
aching
eyes
and
running
her
fingers
up
under
the
thick
fringe
of
dark
blonde
hair
that
barely
skimmed
them
.
Still
the
mannequins
were
appearing
,
their
elongated
clothes-horse
frames
moving
with
a
grace
which
belied
their
tight-drawn
nerves
,
still
the
bursts
of
applause
rang
out
to
drown
the
persistent
clicking
of
the
cameras
,
but
Harriet
leaned
back
against
her
pillar
almost
oblivious
to
them
.
The
clothes
,
beautiful
as
they
were
,
interested
her
not
at
all
.
She
had
grown
up
amongst
beautiful
clothes
,
been
dressed
from
childhood
in
designer
fashion
,
been
made
to
stand
still
for
fittings
for
her
graduation
dress
and
her
first
ball
gown
,
and
hated
every
moment
of
it
.
Clothes
were
all
very
well
,
they
were
her
father
's
life
and
she
knew
that
all
the
privileges
she
enjoyed
were
hers
because
of
clothes
and
the
stupendous
success
they
had
brought
him
,
but
she
could
n't
care
about
them
.
Except
when
they
made
wonderful
pictures
.
Pictures
were
what
mattered
.
And
in
her
camera
was
a
reel
of
beauties
.
Harriet
glanced
around
,
wondering
if
she
could
slip
out
unnoticed
.
It
was
heresy
,
of
course
,
but
the
show
was
likely
to
last
another
hour
at
least
-
Saint
Laurent
was
famous
for
the
length
of
his
shows
-
and
afterwards
there
was
bound
to
be
the
most
fearful
crush
.
Harriet
hesitated
,
then
her
natural
impatience
won
the
day
and
she
slipped
quietly
towards
the
exit
.
All
eyes
were
on
the
catwalk
and
no
one
appeared
to
notice
her
,
apart
from
a
tall
,
grey-haired
woman
in
the
uniform
of
an
atelier
who
moved
towards
her
accusingly
.
Instantly
Harriet
pressed
her
hand
across
her
mouth
in
a
theatrical
gesture
.
"
I
'm
not
feeling
well
"
,
she
whispered
in
somewhat
imperfect
French
,
and
the
woman
moved
hastily
out
of
her
way
.
Photographers
-
cochons
!
she
was
thinking
in
disgust
.
The
girl
had
probably
had
too
much
wine
to
drink
with
her
lunch
.
As
she
emerged
into
the
Rue
Castiglione
the
cold
hit
Harriet
like
a
slap
in
the
face
and
she
lifted
her
camera
,
easing
the
zipper
of
her
sky-blue
ski
jacket
right
up
under
her
chin
and
turning
the
collar
up
around
her
ears
.
Some
of
her
hair
caught
inside
it
and
she
flicked
it
out
,
a
careless
fall
of
dark
blonde
that
framed
her
even-featured
face
.
"
You
should
go
to
a
good
stylist
once
in
a
while
and
have
that
mane
tamed
!
"
Sally
,
her
father
's
wife
,
had
advised
her
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
but
Harriet
had
as
little
time
for
stylists
as
she
had
for
clothes
-
and
besides
,
she
rather
liked
her
hair
just
as
it
was
.
This
way
she
could
simply
wash
it
each
morning
and
let
it
dry
naturally
-
start
trying
for
styles
and
valuable
minutes
had
to
be
wasted
keeping
them
the
way
they
were
meant
to
be
.
I
must
find
a
telephone
,
Harriet
thought
,
as
she
hurried
,
head
bent
against
the
biting
wind
,
along
the
Paris
street
.
I
ca
n't
wait
to
tell
Nick
I
've
got
his
job
in
the
bag
.
Then
I
'll
decide
whether
to
post
him
the
last
reels
of
film
in
a
Jiffy
bag
or
fly
back
to
London
with
them
myself
.
The
thought
gave
her
another
fillip
of
excitement
-
her
first
job
for
Focus
Now
,
the
new
picture
magazine
Nick
was
editing
-
and
it
was
a
corker
,
she
knew
it
in
her
bones
.
Already
she
could
visualise
the
lay-out
-
"
The
Other
Side
of
Fashion
"
she
'd
entitled
it
in
her
mind
's
eye
when
she
'd
discussed
it
with
Nick
.
And
as
he
had
said
,
no-one
was
in
a
better
position
to
do
a
photo
story
like
that
than
she
was
.
"
All
the
fashion
magazines
and
the
women
's
pages
of
the
newspapers
do
straight
fashion
stories
,
"
he
'd
said
,
tugging
thoughtfully
at
the
little
gingery
beard
that
sprouted
from
his
angular
chin
.
"
I
want
something
different
.
And
let's
face
it
,
Focus
Now
is
going
to
be
different
.
"
She
'd
nodded
.
She
'd
known
Nick
for
years
,
meeting
him
when
she
'd
come
to
London
to
visit
her
cousin
Mark
Bristow
,
Sally
's
son
.
She
had
just
started
out
on
her
career
as
a
free-lance
photographer
,
with
nothing
but
a
little
talent
,
a
lot
of
determination
and
the
best
camera
money
could
buy
to
help
her
make
it
.
He
had
been
a
sub-editor
in
those
days
,
working
for
a
huge
magazine
corporation
,
and
they
had
struck
up
an
instant
rapport
,
and
when
he
was
made
first
assistant
editor
and
then
editor
,
always
moving
from
magazine
to
magazine
,
he
had
pushed
work
her
way
whenever
he
could
.
They
had
even
had
an
on-off
affair
and
Harriet
suspected
he
was
in
love
with
her
.
But
she
could
n't
take
him
seriously
.
She
could
n't
take
any
man
seriously
-
or
at
least
not
one
she
'd
yet
met
.
"
I
think
you
use
me
,
Harriet
,
"
he
had
said
once
,
mock-serious
.
"
Well
of
course
I
do
!
"
she
had
teased
.
"
Is
n't
that
what
friends
are
for
?
"
"
Friends
!
"
he
'd
echoed
,
his
soft
Scottish
burr
making
it
sound
almost
mournful
,
and
Harriet
had
experienced
a
moment
's
sharp
guilt
.
But
whatever
his
shortcomings
as
a
prospective
lover
,
Nick
was
good
at
his
job
-
very
good
-
and
his
talent
and
hard
work
had
been
rewarded
when
Paul
Leeman
,
the
publishing
tycoon
,
had
decided
to
launch
the
new
magazine
,
Focus
Now
.
Nick
had
landed
the
job
of
editor
and
when
he
had
told
Harriet
about
it
his
enthusiasm
had
been
infectious
.
"
You
remember
Picture
Post
,
Harriet
?
No
,
probably
you
do
n't
.
You
're
too
young
.
You
were
n't
even
born
when
it
folded
-
and
besides
it
was
an
English
magazine
.
"
"
But
I
know
about
it
of
course
,
"
she
'd
protested
.
"
My
mother
was
English
,
remember
,
and
it
was
a
classic
,
was
n't
it
?
What
photographer
has
n't
heard
of
Picture
Post
-
though
I
suppose
the
American
in
me
world
argue
that
all
those
magazines
were
imitators
of
Life
.
"
"
Right
.
Well
,
Paul
believes
the
time
is
right
to
launch
a
new
mag
on
the
same
lines
.
Stories
told
in
pictures
-
less
copy
than
the
Sunday
supplements
,
more
slanted
to
letting
the
photographs
tell
the
story
.
And
perhaps
with
a
social
angle
,
too
.
But
whatever
,
it
's
got
to
be
different
,
a
totally
fresh
way
of
looking
at
things
.
That
's
where
you
come
in
.
"
"
It
sounds
exciting
.
But
more
like
photo
journalism
than
just
taking
pictures
.
You
think
I
could
handle
it
?
"
In
spite
of
her
apparent
self-confidence
,
in
spite
of
her
twenty-five
years
,
in
spite
of
having
had
the
best
that
money
could
buy
since
she
was
a
little
girl
,
there
was
an
ingenuousness
about
Harriet
which
sprung
from
a
yearning
need
to
prove
herself
-
to
her
father
,
to
her
contemporaries
,
to
the
whole
wide
world
.
Sometimes
being
born
with
every
apparent
advantage
in
life
spawns
the
deepest
need
to
create
something
just
by
oneself
,
to
say
:
"
This
was
n't
handed
to
me
on
a
plate
,
but
I
did
it
just
the
same
!
"
"
I
know
you
can
do
it
"
,
Nick
had
said
.
"
You
're
a
bloody
good
photographer
and
the
work
you
've
been
doing
for
the
last
five
years
proves
it
.
All
you
need
is
the
opportunity
to
really
express
yourself
-
and
Focus
Now
can
give
you
that
.
I
'm
sure
you
'll
come
up
with
all
kinds
of
ideas
of
your
own
,
but
for
starters
why
do
n't
you
do
something
you
know
really
well
-
the
world
of
fashion
.
"
"
Fashion
!
"
Her
tone
had
been
scathing
.
"
Rich
women
with
closets
full
of
clothes
they
'll
never
get
around
to
wearing
.
Fashion
-
one
silly
brainless
bitch
trying
to
outdo
the
others
because
she
's
bored
out
of
her
tiny
mind
and
is
n't
interested
in
anything
other
than
the
way
she
looks
.
"
"
Do
n't
knock
it
,
"
Nick
said
seriously
.
"
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
it
's
a
damned
great
industry
-
and
there
are
plenty
of
facets
to
it
that
never
see
the
light
of
day
.
Find
some
of
them
,
Harriet
,
mix
them
in
with
the
glamour
-
and
see
what
you
get
.
More
than
enough
for
just
one
feature
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
Enough
for
a
whole
series
,
probably
.
But
start
with
Paris
.
After
all
,
to
most
people
Paris
is
still
the
centre
,
the
sun
around
which
all
the
other
satellites
revolve
.
"
"
Well
I
sure
as
hell
would
hate
to
do
Seventh
Avenue
,
"
she
said
with
feeling
.
"
So
-
do
n't
-
or
at
least
,
not
at
first
.
What
about
the
sweatshops
of
Korea
,
or
the
rich
Kuwaiti
women
who
buy
merely
for
their
own
pleasure
and
hide
their
couture
gowns
under
their
abayas
because
they
are
not
allowed
to
display
themselves
-
it
's
a
far
cry
from
the
fashion
world
as
it
is
usually
depicted
,
it
could
make
fascinating
copy
.
Get
out
there
and
find
it
for
me
!
"
And
so
she
had
.
She
'd
done
the
photo
session
of
couture
gowns
as
well
,
of
course
,
clicking
away
dutifully
with
those
other
photographers
who
were
being
dictated
to
by
their
fashion
editors
.
But
it
was
the
unexpected
shots
that
would
provide
the
spice
to
the
story
-
like
the
ones
she
had
just
made
of
the
little
midinette
enthusing
as
she
saw
the
dress
she
'd
sweated
blood
for
,
if
not
created
,
come
down
the
catwalk
to
the
roar
of
applause
.
Harriet
pushed
back
the
cuff
of
her
ski
jacket
and
glanced
at
her
watch
-
the
clear
faced
leather-strapped
Patek
Philippe
man
's
watch
that
she
always
wore
in
preference
to
the
elegant
Cartier
her
father
had
given
her
,
unless
of
course
circumstances
forced
her
into
an
evening
gown
.
Perhaps
,
she
decided
,
she
would
go
back
to
her
hotel
and
phone
Nick
from
there
.
Then
she
'd
call
the
airport
,
enquire
about
flights
and
take
the
pictures
to
London
herself
.
She
'd
like
to
be
on
hand
the
moment
they
came
out
of
the
dark
room
.
And
it
would
be
nice
to
see
Nick
again
too
.
She
raised
her
hand
to
hail
a
cab
but
the
Paris
traffic
was
zooming
by
at
its
usual
break-neck
pace
.
Then
she
spotted
a
public
telephone
and
decided
she
could
not
wait
another
minute
to
call
Nick
and
tell
him
the
job
was
completed
.
She
dived
towards
it
,
anxious
some
other
would-be
caller
should
not
beat
her
to
it
and
begin
on
one
of
those
endless
conversations
the
French
seemed
to
have
,
searching
through
her
pockets
for
change
and
trying
to
recall
the
International
dialling
code
and
the
number
of
the
line
which
connected
direct
with
Nick
's
office
,
bypassing
the
busy
switchboard
,
all
at
the
same
time
.
"
You
have
never
got
out
of
the
childish
habit
of
trying
to
do
several
things
at
once
,
"
Sally
had
said
to
her
once
;
Sally
,
so
cool
,
so
contained
,
so
efficient
she
sometimes
made
Harriet
feel
as
if
she
were
still
a
child
,
though
of
course
she
would
never
admit
it
.
At
the
second
attempt
she
made
the
connection
and
heard
the
telephone
begin
to
ring
at
the
other
end
.
Then
Nick
's
voice
,
that
soft
unmistakable
Scottish
burr
.
"
Hello
?
Nick
Holmes
.
"
"
Nick
-
it
's
me
,
Harriet
.
I
've
finished
the
job
and
I
've
got
the
most
stupendous
pictures
.
I
'm
just
on
my
way
back
to
the
hotel
and
with
luck
I
'll
be
able
to
get
a
flight
tonight
.
I
can
be
with
you
first
thing
in
the
morning
-
maybe
even
this
evening
,
if
you
like
.
"
There
was
a
slight
awkward
pause
and
in
the
tiny
fraction
of
time
that
it
lasted
Harriet
experienced
a
stab
of
pique
.
Nick
was
usually
so
keen
to
see
her
she
had
to
fend
him
off
.
Now
,
just
when
she
was
bursting
to
talk
to
him
about
the
job
,
he
was
going
to
be
less
than
forthcoming
.
"
Unless
you
've
already
got
something
lined
up
,
of
course
,
"
she
said
hastily
.
"
No
.
And
I
'm
very
glad
you
've
finished
the
job
.
"
What
was
that
odd
note
in
Nick
's
voice
?
It
did
n't
sound
in
the
least
like
him
.
"
Me
too
.
You
were
right
-
knowing
the
background
to
the
industry
was
a
tremendous
help
.
Anyway
-
"
"
Harriet
-
have
you
seen
a
newspaper
today
?
"
he
interrupted
her
.
She
laughed
shortly
.
"
You
must
be
joking
!
I
've
been
up
to
my
eyes
in
mannequins
and
haute
couture
.
"
"
Well
-
I
think
you
should
.
"
She
frowned
,
feeling
his
discomfort
with
her
pores
as
well
as
hearing
it
in
his
voice
.
"
Why
?
Someone
else
has
n't
done
my
story
have
they
?
Or
,
oh
no
!
Paul
has
n't
decided
to
fold
Focus
Now
before
it
's
even
off
the
ground
,
has
he
?
"
"
No
-
no
-
nothing
like
that
.
"
"
Then
what
?
Nick
-
my
money
is
running
out
-
"
She
fumbled
in
her
pocket
for
more
change
but
before
she
could
get
in
it
into
the
coin
slot
she
heard
the
click
.
"
Nick
?
"
she
said
urgently
but
it
was
too
late
.
The
line
was
dead
.
She
swore
,
banged
down
the
receiver
and
stood
staring
at
it
.
What
the
hell
had
he
meant
?
Should
she
try
and
get
him
back
again
or
buy
a
newspaper
first
and
try
to
find
out
what
in
the
world
he
had
been
talking
about
?
A
cloud
of
Gauloise
smoke
wafted
past
her
ear
and
she
became
aware
of
a
man
standing
behind
her
,
stamping
his
feet
as
he
waited
with
barely
concealed
impatience
for
the
telephone
.
His
presence
made
up
her
mind
for
her
and
she
turned
,
brushing
past
him
and
heading
towards
a
newspaper
vendor
who
sat
shivering
behind
his
stall
at
the
nearby
entrance
to
a
Metro
station
.
All
the
newspapers
on
the
front
of
the
stall
were
French
and
Harriet
cursed
herself
for
not
being
a
better
linguist
.
She
had
had
every
opportunity
to
be
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
but
she
'd
never
worked
hard
enough
at
it
and
now
she
did
not
feel
like
struggling
with
a
foreign
language
to
search
for
an
item
when
she
did
not
even
know
what
she
was
looking
for
.
But
tucked
away
at
the
back
of
the
stall
were
some
English
and
American
newspapers
.
Yesterday
's
?
No
,
praise
be
,
today
's
-
the
English
ones
,
anyway
.
She
pointed
to
one
and
pulled
out
her
remaining
change
to
pay
for
it
.
Then
she
retreated
into
the
entrance
to
the
Metro
out
of
the
biting
wind
and
opened
it
.
She
saw
the
story
at
once
.
The
photograph
seemed
to
leap
off
the
page
to
hit
her
.
Daddy
.
Mom
.
And
-
that
man
-
Unexpectedly
Harriet
began
to
tremble
.
"
RETURNED
FROM
THE
DEAD
!
FINANCIER
FAXED
HIS
OWN
DEATH
,
WOMAN
ALLEGES
.
"
She
inched
back
against
the
wall
,
part
of
her
wanting
to
find
some
private
place
,
yet
knowing
she
would
not
-
could
not
-
move
from
this
spot
until
she
had
read
what
the
paper
had
to
say
.
As
she
finished
her
breathing
was
ragged
,
her
eyes
darting
from
the
newsprint
to
stare
unseeingly
at
the
people
pushing
past
her
into
the
Metro
and
back
to
the
newsprint
again
.
In
the
street
the
traffic
still
roared
past
,
a
ceaseless
thunder
interspersed
with
the
honking
of
horns
,
but
she
was
no
longer
aware
of
it
.
Even
the
precious
spools
of
film
in
the
camera
slung
around
her
neck
and
tucked
into
the
pockets
of
her
jacket
were
forgotten
.
They
might
have
belonged
,
all
of
them
,
to
another
world
,
another
life
.
Greg
Martin
,
her
father
's
former
partner
,
was
alive
.
She
hardly
remembered
him
,
of
course
.
He
was
a
shadowy
figure
from
the
past
whose
name
was
scarcely
ever
mentioned
except
on
those
rare
occasions
when
they
spoke
of
the
accident
,
that
terrible
accident
that
had
claimed
the
lives
of
him
and
her
mother
when
Harriet
was
only
four
years
old
.
As
for
the
financial
crisis
they
had
gone
through
,
of
which
she
suspected
Greg
was
the
root
cause
,
that
was
never
spoken
of
at
all
.
The
whole
episode
had
been
so
horrendous
,
so
traumatic
,
that
her
father
had
chosen
to
wipe
the
board
clean
of
it
-
on
a
superficial
level
,
at
least
.
Harriet
pressed
a
hand
to
her
mouth
and
closed
her
eyes
.
The
street
seemed
to
be
full
of
perfume
now
,
wafting
around
her
in
the
biting
wind
-
the
perfume
that
was
the
most
evocative
memory
she
had
of
her
mother
,
a
haunting
perfume
,
light
and
teasing
and
sweet
,
a
perfume
that
smelled
a
little
like
a
summer
garden
at
dusk
,
a
perfume
,
the
memory
of
which
had
possessed
the
power
to
bring
tears
to
her
eyes
long
,
long
after
she
had
forgotten
how
to
conjure
up
the
image
of
her
mother
's
face
.
Mom
-
oh
,
Mom
-
why
did
you
go
away
?
She
had
cried
it
into
her
pillow
at
night
,
sobbing
with
the
vain
child
's
hope
that
tears
would
somehow
magically
make
it
all
come
right
,
that
in
the
morning
her
mother
would
be
there
.
But
of
course
she
never
was
.
Her
mother
had
died
in
an
explosion
on
a
luxury
yacht
,
they
had
explained
to
her
.
Gradually
she
had
come
to
terms
with
it
,
accepted
it
as
a
fact
of
life
,
though
the
grief
had
been
longer
in
going
and
the
sadness
was
still
sometimes
there
,
an
echo
in
the
night
.
But
now
-
If
Greg
Martin
was
alive
then
was
it
possible
-
was
there
the
chance
that
it
was
in
any
way
possible
that
her
mother
was
alive
too
?
The
enormity
of
it
rocked
her
.
For
long
minutes
she
stood
there
,
her
thoughts
not
so
much
running
circles
as
buffeting
chaotically
.
It
made
no
sense
-
none
-
yet
here
in
black
and
white
was
proof
that
nothing
was
the
way
it
had
seemed
.
For
the
first
time
in
years
Harriet
was
overwhelmed
by
a
wave
of
homesickness
,
and
not
now
for
New
York
,
but
for
the
haven
of
her
London
flat
,
the
bolt-hole
she
had
made
her
very
own
.
She
folded
the
newspaper
roughly
,
thrust
it
into
her
bag
and
walked
zombie-like
into
the
Metro
.
Get
home
as
quickly
as
possible
.
Suddenly
it
was
all
that
mattered
.
Get
home
.
Then
perhaps
she
could
think
things
through
and
decide
what
to
do
.
Sally
Varna
stepped
out
of
her
bath
,
reluctant
to
leave
the
froth
of
delicately
scented
bubbles
,
reached
for
one
of
the
enormous
pink
towels
the
maid
had
laid
out
ready
for
her
and
wrapped
herself
in
it
.
Then
she
padded
across
to
a
low
stool
and
sat
down
,
surveying
herself
in
the
mirror
that
lined
her
bathroom
walls
on
two
sides
.
The
face
that
looked
back
at
her
was
smooth
,
slightly
flushed
from
the
warmth
of
her
bath
,
certainly
not
a
face
that
looked
its
forty-six
years
.
Even
when
made
up
with
the
finest
cosmetics
money
could
buy
it
would
never
be
beautiful
,
but
still
-
not
bad
for
an
ugly
duckling
,
Sally
thought
,
smiling
wryly
.
She
lifted
one
hand
and
pushed
aside
the
fair
,
highlighted
hair
which
skimmed
her
ears
.
Yes
,
the
tiny
tucks
had
almost
gone
now
,
just
as
the
surgeon
had
promised
they
would
.
No-one
need
ever
know
she
had
had
the
facelift
if
she
chose
not
to
tell
them
.
That
was
why
it
was
so
sensible
to
have
it
done
early
,
before
the
little
lines
and
pouches
became
obvious
.
And
Sally
had
always
prided
herself
on
being
sensible
,
if
nothing
else
.
Sensible
Sally
.
Sally
"
the
sensible
one
"
.
That
was
how
she
had
been
known
as
a
child
when
people
had
contrasted
her
with
her
sister
Paula
.
"
Sally
is
very
clever
.
She
has
such
a
good
head
on
her
shoulders
,
"
they
had
said
,
when
what
they
really
meant
was
that
whilst
Paula
was
a
beauty
,
she
was
really
very
plain
but
they
had
to
find
something
good
to
say
about
her
.
They
had
meant
it
kindly
,
she
knew
,
but
it
had
hurt
all
the
same
.
She
had
n't
wanted
to
be
sensible
or
clever
.
She
had
wanted
to
be
beautiful
like
Paula
,
would
have
traded
everything
to
be
just
a
little
like
the
sister
whose
stunning
good
looks
had
the
power
to
attract
and
mesmerise
wherever
she
went
.
But
where
Paula
's
hair
had
shone
and
bounced
as
if
it
had
caught
some
of
the
morning
's
sunlight
her
own
was
straight
and
mouse
coloured
,
where
Paula
's
eyes
were
the
clearest
,
sharpest
green
hers
were
muddied
to
a
very
ordinary
shade
of
hazel
.
Her
features
were
similar
yet
somehow
blunted
,
her
body
stockier
-
not
fat
yet
somehow
altogether
larger
so
that
beside
Paula
she
always
felt
clumsy
in
spite
of
being
a
full
four
inches
shorter
and
almost
two
years
the
younger
.
"
Mummy
,
why
do
n't
I
look
like
Paula
?
"
she
had
asked
,
staring
wretchedly
at
her
five-year-old
reflection
in
the
mirror
,
but
her
mother
,
herself
slightly
bemused
by
the
young
beauty
she
had
produced
,
had
been
unable
to
give
her
any
satisfactory
answer
.
As
the
girls
had
grown
older
things
had
not
improved
.
No
matter
how
hard
she
tried
to
make
the
most
of
herself
Sally
had
always
been
aware
that
she
could
not
hope
to
rival
Paula
and
the
knowledge
had
damaged
her
self-confidence
so
that
she
always
lived
with
the
feeling
that
people
on
meeting
her
for
the
first
time
would
exclaim
behind
after
back
:
"
Paula
's
sister
?
That
plain
little
thing
?
Goodness
me
,
she
was
in
the
back
row
when
looks
were
handed
out
was
n't
she
!
"
The
fact
that
very
few
other
girls
she
knew
could
hold
a
candle
to
Paula
did
not
help
much
either
.
They
did
n't
have
to
live
with
this
goddess
,
they
did
n't
have
to
compete
with
the
legend
.
In
spite
of
this
,
Sally
had
adored
Paula
.
When
other
girls
,
jealous
of
her
looks
and
the
doors
they
opened
for
her
,
jealous
especially
of
the
way
the
boys
flocked
after
her
,
made
spiteful
remarks
,
Sally
had
always
been
her
fiercest
champion
.
No
one
had
wanted
to
believe
that
Paula
's
beauty
went
right
through
her
more
than
Sally
did
for
she
was
a
shining
golden
idol
as
well
as
a
sister
and
it
had
been
a
shock
to
Sally
when
she
had
at
last
been
forced
to
concede
,
in
private
at
least
,
that
the
other
girls
might
have
been
right
in
the
accusations
they
made
.
Sally
stood
up
,
letting
the
towel
drop
and
shrugging
on
a
silk
wrap
.
It
clung
slightly
to
her
still-damp
skin
and
again
she
surveyed
her
image
in
the
mirror
,
this
time
full-length
.
Years
of
dieting
and
exercise
had
banished
that
slight
stodginess
for
ever
;
now
her
body
looked
lithe
and
firm
,
yet
still
blessed
with
more
curves
than
Paula
's
had
ever
been
,
as
much
a
denial
of
her
years
as
her
face
.
In
some
ways
those
days
when
she
had
lived
in
Paula
's
shadow
seemed
a
very
long
time
ago
,
in
others
they
might
have
been
just
yesterday
.
She
had
never
been
able
to
equal
her
sister
's
matchless
beauty
,
she
knew
,
but
at
least
she
presented
the
world
with
a
fair
imitation
of
it
.
And
she
had
everything
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
-
more
.
This
house
on
Central
Park
South
,
a
ranch
in
Colorado
,
a
home
in
Montego
Bay
,
a
private
jet
at
her
disposal
,
the
wherewithal
to
buy
anything
which
took
her
fancy
.
Not
bad
for
a
girl
who
had
grown
up
on
a
council
estate
.
Most
important
of
all
,
she
was
married
to
the
man
who
had
been
Paula
's
husband
.
It
was
the
final
proof
that
perhaps
,
after
all
,
she
had
not
been
as
inferior
to
her
sister
as
she
had
imagined
.
Only
one
shadow
lay
over
Sally
's
life
,
a
secret
shadow
that
none
of
the
luxuries
she
enjoyed
could
quite
banish
.
For
a
moment
it
hovered
over
her
thoughts
then
,
with
an
ease
born
of
long
practice
,
she
pushed
it
away
and
went
into
her
dressing
room
.
Tonight
she
and
Hugo
were
dining
with
an
important
senator
who
generally
included
show
business
personalities
among
his
guests
and
she
had
not
yet
decided
what
to
wear
.
She
crossed
to
one
of
the
racks
which
lined
the
watered
silk
walls
,
her
feet
sinking
into
the
deep
cream
carpet
,
and
took
out
a
black
gown
,
holding
it
against
her
.
The
neck
was
high
and
round
,
the
sleeves
decorously
straight
to
the
wrists
.
But
at
the
back
the
bodice
was
slit
from
collar
to
midriff
and
the
skirt
was
daringly
short
.
Worn
with
her
Van
Cleef
diamond
earbobs
and
bracelet
it
would
look
quite
stunning
.
Yes
,
she
thought
she
would
wear
the
black
-
or
perhaps
the
strawberry
crushed
velvet
-
The
sound
of
someone
entering
her
bedroom
,
which
lay
beyond
the
dressing
room
,
made
Sally
turn
,
still
holding
the
dress
against
her
and
frowning
with
annoyance
.
She
had
instructed
the
maids
not
to
disturb
her
for
she
valued
her
privacy
and
having
staff
constantly
on
hand
was
one
of
the
things
she
had
found
most
difficult
to
become
accustomed
to
.
Very
nice
to
be
able
to
step
out
of
used
underwear
and
know
it
would
be
laundered
and
returned
to
its
drawer
pressed
and
scented
,
even
better
never
to
have
to
worry
about
clearing
a
table
or
washing
up
,
but
nevertheless
there
was
something
vaguely
disconcerting
about
maids
who
went
silently
,
sneakily
about
their
duties
under
her
very
nose
.
"
Who
is
it
?
"
she
called
a
little
sharply
.
The
door
to
the
dressing
room
opened
and
to
her
surprise
she
saw
that
it
was
Hugo
.
Her
eyebrows
,
which
she
darkened
artificially
so
that
they
no
longer
merged
into
her
skin
,
lifted
slightly
.
She
had
not
expected
him
home
for
at
least
another
hour
.
At
this
time
of
day
he
was
usually
still
at
his
office
in
the
550
building
on
Seventh
Avenue
.
"
Hugo
!
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
What
are
you
doing
home
so
early
?
"
He
came
into
the
dressing
room
and
closed
the
door
,
a
middle-aged
man
of
medium
height
wearing
a
grey
suit
with
a
white
roll-neck
shirt
.
Then
as
he
turned
towards
her
the
overhead
lights
that
she
had
switched
on
to
look
through
her
dresses
shone
directly
onto
his
face
and
she
noticed
how
pale
and
drawn
he
looked
,
lines
that
were
usually
unnoticeable
etched
between
nose
and
mouth
,
eyes
almost
feverishly
bright
.
"
Are
you
all
right
?
"
she
asked
.
"
You
're
not
ill
?
"
He
did
not
answer
,
just
stood
there
looking
at
her
as
if
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
how
to
begin
.
"
Hugo
!
"
She
took
an
anxious
step
towards
him
.
"
Greg
Martin
is
alive
,
"
he
said
.
His
words
stopped
her
in
her
tracks
.
"
What
did
you
say
?
"
"
Greg
Martin
is
alive
.
He
's
been
living
in
Australia
.
He
did
n't
die
on
the
Lorelei
.
The
whole
damned
thing
must
have
been
a
fake
.
"
"
Oh
my
God
,
"
Sally
said
.
"
I
know
.
I
could
n't
believe
it
either
.
But
I
've
had
the
story
checked
out
,
Sally
.
There
is
no
doubt
it
's
true
.
I
had
to
come
home
and
tell
you
immediately
.
Because
you
realise
what
it
means
,
do
n't
you
?
If
Greg
is
alive
then
the
chances
are
Paula
is
alive
too
.
"
"
Oh
my
God
,
"
she
said
again
.
The
room
seemed
to
have
gone
dark
,
as
if
someone
had
turned
off
the
lights
,
and
she
wondered
if
she
might
be
going
to
faint
.
She
stood
frozen
,
still
clutching
the
black
dress
against
herself
,
looking
at
her
husband
and
seeing
only
her
world
crumbling
around
her
.
She
had
always
known
this
moment
would
come
one
day
.
Now
it
had
arrived
and
still
Sally
knew
she
was
no
more
prepared
for
it
than
she
had
ever
been
.
It
had
begun
to
snow
in
London
.
The
first
great
white
flakes
had
melted
on
the
pavements
,
now
it
was
falling
thicker
and
faster
,
building
up
on
the
window
ledges
and
in
the
cricks
and
crannies
,
turning
to
slush
on
the
roads
as
the
traffic
churned
through
it
.
In
her
small
workroom
on
the
top
floor
of
a
crumbling
old
warehouse
in
Whitechapel
Theresa
Arnold
shivered
and
turned
on
another
bar
of
her
portable
gas
fire
.
She
could
n't
really
afford
it
and
when
she
needed
a
new
cylinder
it
had
to
be
humped
up
three
flights
of
stairs
,
always
a
nuisance
for
which
she
had
to
enlist
the
help
of
one
of
her
boyfriends
,
but
when
she
got
cold
Theresa
's
fingers
turned
numb
,
white
,
bloodless
lumps
that
no
longer
seemed
to
belong
to
her
hands
.
Then
she
could
not
work
properly
and
it
was
imperative
she
worked
or
her
new
collection
would
never
be
ready
on
time
.
Theresa
rubbed
her
hands
together
to
bring
some
life
back
into
them
and
bent
over
the
sheets
of
paper
laid
out
on
her
work
table
,
trying
to
forget
the
cold
and
concentrate
on
her
designs
.
They
had
to
be
good
-
not
just
good
but
sensational
-
or
she
would
let
everyone
down
,
all
those
who
believed
in
her
-
her
small
workforce
of
pattern
cutters
and
outworkers
,
the
friends
from
art
school
who
dropped
in
to
lend
their
help
and
support
,
and
most
of
all
her
mother
,
who
had
put
her
house
up
as
collateral
for
the
bank
loan
that
had
set
her
up
and
enabled
her
to
get
started
.
Theresa
sighed
,
the
cold
depressing
her
and
quenching
her
usual
defiant
optimism
.
How
easy
it
had
all
seemed
then
-
how
exciting
!
When
she
had
graduated
from
the
School
of
Fashion
she
had
sold
her
entire
degree
collection
to
Lady
Jane
,
a
small
but
exclusive
West
End
boutique
,
who
had
greeted
her
designs
with
such
enthusiasm
that
she
had
believed
the
world
was
her
oyster
and
everything
was
about
to
happen
for
her
.
Riding
on
a
high
she
had
decided
to
set
herself
up
as
an
independent
designer
.
But
it
was
all
so
much
more
difficult
than
she
had
ever
imagined
it
would
be
.
Perhaps
,
she
thought
it
was
because
Mark
had
been
there
at
the
planning
stage
-
Mark
Bristow
,
the
dynamic
young
advertising
executive
she
had
met
and
fallen
in
love
with
when
she
had
been
chasing
jobs
in
the
heart
of
Somerset
;
Mark
who
,
in
spite
of
being
English
,
had
lived
long
enough
in
the
States
to
absorb
-
and
give
off
-
some
of
the
typically
American
blend
of
enthusiasm
and
energy
.
He
had
encouraged
and
praised
her
,
bullied
her
a
little
when
she
needed
bullying
,
and
given
her
the
love
and
support
that
had
made
her
feel
,
even
in
the
darkest
moments
of
self-doubt
,
that
she
could
rise
above
all
the
problems
and
emerge
triumphant
.
It
was
Mark
who
had
persuaded
her
to
approach
the
bank
for
a
loan
,
Mark
who
had
suggested
her
old
friend
Linda
George
,
who
had
graduated
in
business
studies
at
the
same
time
that
Theresa
had
finished
her
fashion
degree
,
should
join
forces
with
her
to
organise
the
commercial
side
,
Mark
who
had
given
her
enough
confidence
in
herself
for
her
to
allow
her
mother
to
put
up
her
house
as
security
-
something
Theresa
had
fought
against
even
whilst
realising
there
was
no
other
way
to
secure
the
loan
she
needed
.
And
above
all
it
was
Mark
who
had
made
her
feel
loved
and
special
.
"
I
am
very
proud
of
you
,
lady
"
,
he
had
said
and
she
had
glowed
with
happiness
and
a
secret
bubbling
excitement
that
came
from
believing
she
could
conquer
the
world
with
her
talent
.
But
now
Mark
was
no
longer
around
.
He
had
gone
out
of
her
life
suddenly
and
without
explanation
and
try
as
she
might
Theresa
simply
could
not
get
over
losing
him
.
Why
-
why
-
why
?
she
had
asked
herself
over
and
over
again
,
why
did
it
end
that
way
?
We
were
so
close
-
were
n't
we
?
We
were
in
love
-
were
n't
we
?
How
could
I
have
imagined
something
like
that
?
But
the
answers
never
made
sense
and
the
fact
remained
,
whatever
she
had
chosen
to
believe
Mark
had
simply
walked
out
on
her
and
not
bothered
to
come
back
.
She
had
begin
to
accept
it
now
,
but
there
was
still
a
yearning
deep
inside
her
,
his
absence
a
constant
nagging
ache
in
her
heart
,
and
her
business
enterprise
seemed
to
have
been
affected
too
,
for
it
was
as
though
some
of
her
confidence
had
drained
away
,
running
down
her
cheeks
with
her
tears
.
With
Mark
anything
had
seemed
possible
.
Without
him
some
of
the
magic
had
gone
from
her
life
and
the
dullness
encroached
into
her
work
,
no
matter
how
she
tried
to
compartmentalise
it
.
Now
the
problems
were
paramount
.
A
number
of
shops
and
boutiques
had
shown
an
interest
in
her
clothes
but
she
still
had
to
produce
them
,
innovative
yet
saleable
,
not
too
expensive
for
the
market
but
of
a
good
quality
.
In
many
ways
it
was
a
vicious
circle
-
everything
cost
so
much
more
if
one
could
n't
produce
in
bulk
,
but
to
produce
in
bulk
one
needed
capital
-
and
plenty
of
outlets
.
And
always
she
was
haunted
by
the
knowledge
that
if
she
failed
her
mother
would
lose
her
home
.
What
she
needed
desperately
,
of
course
,
was
a
backer
-
someone
to
put
up
enough
money
to
make
her
financially
secure
while
she
created
.
But
as
yet
no
genie
had
materialised
,
no
matter
how
hard
she
metaphorically
rubbed
the
magic
lamp
.
Linda
was
working
on
that
one
too
.
Let's
hope
she
comes
up
with
something
pretty
soon
,
Theresa
thought
.
If
she
does
n't
I
do
n't
know
how
much
longer
I
can
carry
on
.
The
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
rickety
staircase
leading
to
her
workroom
made
Theresa
look
up
from
her
drawings
,
a
small
ray
of
hope
that
refused
to
be
extinguished
flickering
to
life
.
Somehow
she
could
never
hear
disembodied
footsteps
on
the
stairs
without
wondering
fleetingly
if
it
might
be
Mark
returning
as
unexpectedly
as
he
had
left
.
Then
,
a
moment
later
the
hope
died
as
tall
young
man
dressed
in
an
aged
reefer
coat
and
brown
leather
cap
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
"
Weasel
!
Hi
!
"
she
said
,
smiling
a
greeting
which
she
hoped
concealed
her
disappointment
.
"
What
are
you
doing
here
?
"
It
was
not
a
question
requiring
an
answer
-
Weasel
was
a
good
friend
from
art
school
days
and
often
dropped
in
unannounced
.
"
Shit
,
it
's
cold
in
here
,
Terri
,
"
he
said
now
,
stamping
his
feet
in
their
Doc
Martens
.
His
breath
puffed
out
like
white
smoke
.
"
You
do
n't
have
to
tell
me
that
!
"
she
snorted
.
"
Put
the
kettle
on
if
you
want
a
coffee
.
"
"
Oh
,
I
want
a
coffee
,
all
right
,
and
so
do
you
-
but
not
here
.
Come
on
,
I
'm
taking
you
to
that
little
cafe
down
the
road
-
what
's
it
called
now
?
"
"
Mario
's
-
I
think
.
It
's
always
changing
its
name
.
But
I
ca
n't
stop
to
go
out
for
coffee
.
I
've
got
far
too
much
to
do
.
We
ca
n't
all
be
gentlemen
of
leisure
like
you
,
living
off
the
social
.
"
"
Less
cheek
if
you
do
n't
mind
!
One
day
someone
will
appreciate
my
sculptures
,
you
'll
see
.
In
the
meantime
I
intend
to
stay
healthy
enough
to
enjoy
success
when
it
comes
and
you
'd
be
wise
to
do
the
"
But
I
have
to
get
these
done
.
"
"
You
never
will
if
you
catch
pneumonia
.
Come
on
,
get
your
coat
-
or
are
you
already
wearing
it
?
You
're
coming
with
me
and
I
'm
not
taking
no
for
an
answer
.
"
"
All
right
,
stop
bullying
.
"
Theresa
reached
for
her
thick
knitted
shawl
and
knotted
it
around
her
shoulders
-
as
Weasel
had
observed
,
she
was
already
wearing
her
jacket
in
an
effort
to
keep
warm
.
She
turned
off
the
gas
fire
-
must
save
the
Calor
gas
!
-
and
the
lights
and
followed
him
out
onto
the
landing
,
locking
the
door
behind
her
.
"
Things
no
better
,
I
assume
,
"
Weasel
said
as
they
tramped
down
the
stairs
,
deftly
avoiding
those
treads
which
had
rotted
.
"
Fraid
not
.
"
"
Mind
this
patch
,
it
's
slippery
,
"
Weasel
warned
as
he
traversed
a
landing
where
snow
had
drifted
in
through
a
broken
skylight
.
"
I
know
,
I
know
.
I
just
wish
they
had
n't
boarded
up
the
windows
.
It
makes
the
staircase
so
dark
.
"
Weasel
reached
the
bottom
and
pushed
open
the
door
to
street
level
.
"
What
you
need
,
Miss
Top
Designer
1991
,
is
a
decent
place
to
work
from
.
"
She
grimaced
.
"
What
I
need
is
a
miracle
.
"
In
the
gutter
a
copy
of
the
morning
's
newspaper
lay
discarded
,
snow
and
slush
turning
it
to
pulp
and
partially
obscuring
the
headline
FINANCIER
RETURNS
FROM
THE
DEAD
.
As
he
passed
,
Weasel
gave
the
newspaper
a
kick
with
the
toe
of
his
Doc
Martens
.
Theresa
did
not
even
see
it
.
As
the
taxi
swept
along
the
Kensington
street
,
its
headlights
tunnelling
into
the
murky
darkness
,
Harriet
leaned
forward
and
spoke
through
the
half-open
glass
partition
.
"
Just
here
,
please
.
"
The
taxi
squealed
to
a
stop
.
Harriet
,
who
had
been
watching
the
meter
,
pulled
a
note
out
of
her
bag
and
passed
it
to
the
driver
.
"
Thanks
.
Keep
the
change
.
"
She
swung
herself
out
onto
the
snow-wet
pavement
,
hauling
her
bags
after
her
.
Home
!
Thank
God
!
She
almost
ran
up
the
path
.
Hers
was
the
ground
floor
flat
of
a
tall
old
house
which
had
seen
better
days
and
the
communal
front
door
was
reached
by
means
of
three
stone
steps
.
Harriet
had
climbed
them
and
had
her
key
in
the
lock
when
she
heard
footsteps
on
the
path
behind
her
and
a
male
voice
called
:
"
Excuse
me
!
"
She
swung
round
,
surprised
and
a
little
wary
.
"
Yes
?
"
"
Miss
Varna
?
"
There
was
a
hint
of
authority
but
no
menace
in
the
gravelly
voice
and
his
overcoat
,
collar
turned
up
against
the
cold
,
looked
perfectly
respectable
,
but
for
some
reason
Harriet
's
sense
of
unease
only
increased
.
"
Who
wants
her
?
"
she
asked
shortly
.
"
I
'm
Tom
O'Neill
,
acting
for
British
and
Cosmopolitan
Assurance
.
I
called
on
you
earlier
but
there
was
no
reply
and
I
could
see
the
place
was
in
darkness
.
I
was
just
leaving
when
your
taxi
arrived
.
"
"
Thank
you
but
I
'm
not
in
need
of
any
assurance
.
"
Harriet
pushed
the
door
ajar
and
removed
the
keys
from
the
lock
.
"
If
you
'll
excuse
me
-
"
"
I
'm
not
selling
insurance
.
I
want
to
talk
to
you
about
quite
a
different
matter
.
It
concerns
Paula
Varna
.
Your
mother
,
I
believe
.
"
Harriet
stiffened
,
totally
taken
by
surprise
and
annoyed
with
herself
for
not
realising
the
moment
he
mentioned
insurance
the
reason
why
he
was
here
.
But
it
simply
had
n't
occurred
to
her
.
Of
course
when
one
thought
about
it
rationally
it
was
obvious
there
was
bound
to
be
an
investigation
of
some
kind
,
but
throughout
the
long
flight
she
had
been
too
concerned
with
the
purely
personal
implications
of
the
news
item
to
give
a
thought
to
those
who
might
have
a
financial
interest
in
the
story
.
"
Paula
Varna
was
my
mother
,
yes
,
"
she
said
,
oddly
defensive
.
"
But
I
'd
really
rather
not
talk
to
you
or
anyone
tonight
.
I
have
only
just
flown
in
from
Paris
and
I
am
very
tired
.
"
"
It
wo
n't
take
long
,
"
he
persisted
without
so
much
as
a
hint
of
apology
.
"
Just
a
few
questions
and
I
'll
leave
you
in
peace
.
"
"
Mr
O'Neill
-
"
"
It
might
be
easier
if
we
talked
inside
.
"
Again
,
that
suggestion
of
authority
.
Harriet
bristled
.
"
I
'm
not
in
the
habit
of
letting
strangers
into
my
flat
-
especially
at
this
hour
.
How
do
I
know
you
are
who
you
say
you
are
?
"
"
My
card
.
"
He
passed
it
to
her
and
she
examined
it
briefly
.
Somehow
she
had
no
real
doubts
as
to
whether
Mr
Tom
O'Neill
was
genuine
.
She
almost
wished
he
was
not
.
"
You
'd
better
come
in
then
.
"
She
led
the
way
into
the
communal
hall
which
she
personally
had
taken
upon
herself
to
brighten
up
with
a
vase
of
dried
flowers
and
a
couple
of
good
,
but
ancient
,
rugs
which
she
had
picked
up
for
a
song
at
an
auction
sale
.
In
the
full
light
she
was
surprised
to
see
he
was
much
younger
than
his
bulky
,
overcoat-clad
figure
had
led
her
to
believe
-
and
a
great
deal
better
looking
.
Not
handsome
exactly
.
That
was
not
a
word
one
would
apply
to
Tom
O'Neill
.
But
certainly
hunky
,
with
strong
,
irregular
features
,
a
full
,
jutting
lower
lip
and
very
blue
eyes
.
She
turned
her
back
on
him
,
unlocking
the
inner
door
,
and
as
the
warmth
from
the
storage
heaters
wafted
out
to
greet
them
she
thanked
God
that
she
had
had
the
foresight
to
leave
them
on
-
she
did
n't
think
she
had
been
properly
warm
since
reading
the
newspaper
this
afternoon
-
no
,
not
even
on
the
plane
.
She
was
longing
for
a
drink
-
some
of
her
emergency
ration
of
scotch
-
but
she
did
not
see
how
she
could
have
one
herself
without
also
offering
one
to
her
visitor
,
something
she
had
no
intention
of
doing
.
She
switched
on
the
lights
,
dumped
her
bag
on
the
table
and
turned
to
him
abruptly
.
"
Well
,
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
"
As
I
said
,
I
'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
your
mother
.
"
He
was
regarding
her
closely
,
his
very-blue
eyes
disconcertingly
direct
.
"
As
a
representative
of
the
company
who
insured
both
her
life
and
that
of
Mr
Martin
,
not
to
mention
the
boat
,
I
am
anxious
to
discover
the
truth
of
what
happened
.
"
"
I
'm
afraid
there
is
nothing
I
can
tell
you
.
I
was
four
years
old
when
my
mother
died
.
"
Something
unspoken
hung
in
the
air
between
them
.
She
felt
it
with
her
pores
,
saw
it
in
the
slight
lift
of
his
eyebrow
and
the
way
one
corner
of
his
mouth
tucked
.
Then
he
asked
suddenly.
:
"
When
did
you
last
see
your
mother
,
Miss
Varna
?
"
"
I
told
you
-
when
I
was
four
years
old
.
It
was
the
night
before
she
left
for
her
trip
.
She
came
to
my
room
to
say
goodnight
to
me
-
"
She
broke
off
as
another
memory
stirred
-
that
same
evening
,
but
later
,
raised
voices
coming
from
her
mother
's
room
,
her
child
's
feet
pattering
along
the
landing
,
peeping
through
a
crack
in
the
door
-
Her
eyes
darkened
as
she
relived
it
and
his
sharp
investigator
's
eye
noticed
it
.
"
And
?
"
he
prompted
her
.
"
After
that
?
"
"
I
tell
you
I
did
n't
see
her
again
after
that
night
.
"
"
But
something
happened
.
"
"
Nothing
happened
.
For
God
's
sake
-
"
"
What
did
she
say
to
you
,
then
,
when
she
looked
in
to
say
goodnight
?
Did
she
seem
her
usual
self
?
"
"
I
do
n't
know
.
I
do
n't
remember
.
Mom
was
always
-
Mom
.
And
I
ca
n't
see
that
what
she
said
to
me
is
any
of
your
business
.
"
"
I
'm
afraid
a
quarter
of
a
million
pounds
sterling
paid
out
on
your
mother
's
life
makes
it
my
business
.
"
He
crossed
to
a
small
occasional
table
,
picking
up
a
silver-framed
studio
portrait
.
"
When
was
this
taken
?
"
Suddenly
Harriet
had
had
enough
.
"
Put
that
down
!
"
she
snapped
.
"
It
is
your
mother
,
is
n't
it
?
"
"
Yes
it
is
.
It
was
taken
before
I
was
born
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
when
she
was
still
modelling
-
she
was
a
top
model
,
you
know
.
But
you
have
no
right
to
come
in
here
meddling
with
my
things
.
Even
a
policeman
would
n't
dare
poke
about
without
a
search
warrant
-
and
you
're
not
a
policeman
.
You
are
a
private
investigator
.
I
do
n't
have
to
talk
to
you
.
"
He
looked
up
from
the
photograph
,
totally
unruffled
.
"
I
usually
find
that
the
people
who
lose
their
tempers
when
I
start
asking
questions
are
the
ones
with
something
to
hide
,
"
he
said
easily
.
"
What
the
hell
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
"
I
'm
sure
you
can
work
it
out
for
yourself
,
Miss
Varna
.
"
"
No
,
I
ca
n't
.
Spell
it
out
for
me
,
please
.
You
're
accusing
me
of
complicity
in
fraud
,
is
that
it
?
"
"
A
four-year-old
child
?
Heaven
forbid
!
However
,
it
would
seem
that
Greg
Martin
,
your
mother
's
companion
when
the
yacht
was
lost
,
has
been
fooling
us
these
past
twenty
years
.
He
has
turned
up
in
Australia
,
has
n't
he
?
"
"
I
'm
sure
you
know
a
great
deal
more
about
it
than
I
do
.
I
only
know
what
I
read
in
the
papers
.
"
His
eyebrow
lifted
again
,
an
expression
of
polite
disbelief
.
"
Really
?
Then
this
must
all
be
very
distressing
to
you
.
"
She
ignored
the
somewhat
patronising
platitude
.
"
As
far
as
I
can
make
out
no
one
has
yet
said
conclusively
that
this
man
is
Greg
Martin'
,
she
argued
.
"
True
.
That
is
something
that
has
to
be
established
.
However
,
assuming
it
is
,
then
we
must
look
very
carefully
at
what
happened
to
your
mother
.
After
all
,
she
too
might
have
survived
the
explosion
.
"
His
words
jarred
Harriet
and
she
swallowed
at
the
ball
of
nerves
that
suddenly
seemed
to
be
constricting
her
throat
.
In
a
way
he
was
only
echoing
her
own
thoughts
but
to
hear
them
spoken
aloud
and
by
this
unsympathetic
stranger
was
oddly
disturbing
.
"
And
if
she
is
n't
dead
then
where
the
hell
is
she
?
"
she
demanded
.
"
That
is
what
I
am
being
paid
to
find
out
.
I
had
hoped
you
would
be
able
to
help
me
but
since
you
say
you
ca
n't
I
shall
have
to
pursue
other
avenues
.
It
may
take
me
a
little
longer
but
-
"
he
smiled
,
and
his
confidence
made
her
dislike
him
more
than
ever
,
"
I
promise
you
I
shall
get
there
in
the
end
.
"
"
Then
in
that
case
I
suggest
you
make
a
start
right
away
,
"
Harriet
said
.
She
crossed
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
.
"
Goodnight
,
Mr
O'Neill
.
"
"
Goodnight
Miss
Varna
.
Thank
you
for
your
time
.
"
She
did
not
reply
,
simply
stood
holding
the
door
until
he
had
gone
.
Then
she
leaned
against
it
,
realising
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
still
wearing
her
ski
jacket
in
the
warm
flat
,
she
was
shivering
again
.
She
levered
herself
away
from
the
door
,
crossed
to
the
heavy
old
sideboard
and
took
out
the
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
glass
.
Taken
neat
the
spirit
burned
her
throat
and
she
held
the
glass
cupped
between
her
hands
,
staring
into
space
.
Was
it
possible
Paula
was
still
alive
-
and
did
she
even
want
her
to
be
?
Of
course
the
immediate
answer
was
"
Yes
!
Oh
yes
!
"
but
in
truth
it
was
not
that
simple
.
What
sort
of
woman
would
willingly
choose
to
leave
her
husband
and
child
without
a
qualm
,
allow
them
to
grieve
for
her
and
believe
her
dead
?
Certainly
not
the
dream
mother
a
bereaved
child
had
created
for
herself
.
With
a
sense
of
shock
Harriet
realised
that
in
the
last
hours
Paula
had
become
more
of
a
stranger
to
her
than
she
had
ever
been
during
the
twenty
years
she
had
believed
her
dead
.
A
beautiful
face
in
a
photograph
,
a
few
misty
memories
,
a
haunting
perfume
tugging
at
her
senses
,
and
Paula
had
been
whatever
Harriet
wanted
her
to
be
.
Now
for
the
first
time
she
was
face
to
face
with
fragmented
suggestions
of
reality
,
distorted
perhaps
,
like
the
sun
glancing
on
water
,
but
hinting
at
something
very
different
from
the
fairy
tale
princess
the
child
Harriet
had
claimed
as
her
own
.
Could
you
have
done
such
a
thing
,
Mom
?
Harriet
asked
silently
and
was
as
far
as
ever
from
an
answer
.
The
image
was
all
she
had
.
She
knew
nothing
of
the
real
woman
behind
it
.
The
long
hours
of
the
night
stretched
ahead
of
her
and
the
prospect
opened
a
well
of
loneliness
within
her
.
Despising
herself
for
her
weakness
she
reached
for
the
telephone
,
dialling
Nick
's
number
.
For
a
long
while
the
bell
rang
and
Harriet
felt
the
sense
of
loneliness
deepen
.
He
was
n't
there
.
Then
just
as
she
was
about
to
replace
the
receiver
she
heard
his
voice
,
that
soft
familiar
Scottish
burr
.
"
Nick
"
,
she
said
,
choky
suddenly
.
"
Harriet
-
is
that
you
?
You
're
back
then
.
"
"
Yes
.
Just
.
I
was
beginning
to
think
you
were
n't
there
.
"
"
I
'm
listening
to
some
music
.
I
had
it
turned
up
a
bit
too
loud
.
I
did
n't
hear
the
phone
at
first
.
"
In
the
background
she
could
hear
The
Anvil
Chorus
from
Il
Trovatore
.
"
Nick
-
do
you
think
-
?
"
she
began
hesitantly
.
"
You
want
me
to
come
over
?
"
he
asked
,
reading
her
mind
.
"
Would
you
?
I
know
it
's
late
but
-
"
"
I
'll
be
with
you
in
-
twenty
minutes
.
"
"
Oh
Nick
-
thanks
!
"
"
My
pleasure
,
"
he
said
drily
.
"
You
ask
me
,
Harriet
,
all
too
seldom
.
"
"
And
for
goodness
sake
,
"
she
said
,
looking
at
the
almost-empty
Scotch
bottle
,
"
bring
something
good
and
strong
to
drink
with
you
.
"
In
the
time
it
took
Nick
to
arrive
Harriet
forced
herself
to
wash
and
change
into
a
clean
sweatshirt
,
though
the
most
mundane
of
everyday
actions
seemed
a
huge
effort
.
By
the
time
she
heard
his
car
squeezing
into
a
parking
space
outside
she
was
calmer
;
at
least
outwardly
,
opening
the
door
to
him
with
what
she
hoped
gave
the
appearance
of
nonchalance
.
"
Hi
!
Sorry
to
drag
you
out
on
a
night
like
this
.
"
"
Do
n't
even
think
of
it
.
"
He
kissed
her
briefly
on
the
lips
and
came
into
the
flat
,
a
slightly-built
sandy-haired
man
in
his
mid-thirties
wearing
a
heavy
black
overcoat
over
a
sweater
and
cords
.
From
one
of
the
voluminous
pockets
he
produced
a
bottle
of
Scotch
and
put
it
down
on
the
table
.
"
Drinks
-
as
ordered
.
I
take
it
you
are
in
need
.
"
"
Too
true
!
What
a
day
!
Oh
,
bless
you
Nick
.
"
She
fetched
her
glass
.
"
Pour
me
one
,
will
you
,
when
you
've
taken
your
coat
off
.
And
what
about
you
?
Are
you
drinking
too
?
"
"
I
'll
keep
you
company
.
But
better
make
it
a
small
one
-
If
I
'm
driving
.
"
There
was
just
the
hint
of
a
question
in
his
tone
.
She
ignored
it
,
habit
making
her
play
it
coolly
even
now
,
in
her
moment
of
need
.
"
I
got
the
pictures
,
Nick
.
Some
beauties
,
I
think
.
"
She
was
annoyed
to
hear
the
slight
tremble
in
her
voice
.
"
Great
.
"
He
had
tossed
his
coat
over
the
back
of
a
chair
and
was
pouring
whiskies
.
He
handed
one
to
her
,
looking
at
her
directly
.
"
You
did
n't
ask
me
over
here
to
discuss
the
pictures
though
,
Harriet
-
admit
it
.
It
's
-
the
other
business
,
is
n't
it
?
I
take
it
you
did
as
I
suggested
and
got
hold
of
a
paper
.
"
"
Yes
.
"
She
gulped
at
the
whisky
,
then
thought
better
of
it
.
"
I
'll
get
some
ice
.
"
When
she
returned
from
the
kitchen
he
had
made
himself
comfortable
on
the
sofa
.
She
went
over
and
perched
herself
on
the
ottoman
at
his
feet
.
"
I
've
had
the
insurance
investigators
here
,
"
she
said
.
He
raised
an
eyebrow
.
"
Already
?
They
do
n't
waste
time
.
"
"
No
.
I
suppose
,
as
the
man
said
,
with
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
million
at
stake
they
ca
n't
afford
to
,
but
all
the
same
,
it
was
n't
very
pleasant
.
Especially
since
I
'd
only
just
arrived
back
from
Paris
.
"
She
proceeded
to
relate
the
interview
,
keeping
nothing
back
apart
from
the
effect
it
had
had
on
her
,
but
Nick
knew
her
too
well
to
be
fooled
.
"
It
must
have
been
pretty
gruesome
,
"
he
said
.
"
Yes
-
well
-
it
's
such
a
damned
cheek
!
First
suggesting
I
was
involved
in
some
insurance
fraud
and
then
as
good
as
saying
Mom
walked
out
on
us
!
I
realise
from
his
point
of
view
his
company
would
be
a
quarter
of
a
million
better
off
if
they
could
prove
it
should
never
have
been
paid
in
the
first
place
,
but
-
it
is
my
mother
he
was
talking
about
dammit
!
"
"
Oh
Harri
,
darling
Harri
-
"
He
reached
for
her
,
pulling
her
up
onto
the
sofa
beside
him
and
putting
his
arm
around
her
.
"
And
what
do
you
think
?
"
"
What
do
I
think
?
Well
,
she
's
dead
of
course
.
She
'd
never
do
that
to
us
-
"
She
broke
off
.
"
No
,
to
be
truthful
,
that
's
what
I
told
him
,
but
deep
down
I
do
n't
know
.
I
honestly
do
n't
know
.
"
She
gulped
her
drink
.
"
Does
it
matter
?
"
he
asked
.
She
shook
herself
free
of
his
arm
.
"
Well
of
course
it
bloody
well
matters
!
"
"
That
's
not
the
point
.
"
"
Do
you
really
want
to
know
the
truth
?
It
might
be
a
pretty
upsetting
business
.
"
"
I
'm
upset
already
,
"
she
admitted
.
"
In
any
case
-
I
'm
going
to
have
to
face
it
sooner
or
later
.
That
O'Neill
man
is
n't
going
to
let
up
now
he
's
got
his
teeth
into
it
.
He
's
going
to
dig
and
dig
.
God
what
a
job
!
Imagine
doing
a
shitty
job
like
that
!
"
"
Not
unlike
a
journalist
really
,
"
Nick
observed
drily
.
"
Well
,
Harri
,
you
can
either
sit
back
and
let
him
do
the
digging
or
you
can
do
a
little
investigation
yourself
.
"
"
I
do
n't
know
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
want
to
.
"
"
I
was
rather
hoping
you
'd
do
a
nice
follow-up
photo
session
for
me
"
,
he
said
slyly
.
"
On
what
?
"
"
That
's
up
to
you
.
But
you
did
n't
cover
Kuwait
in
this
lot
,
did
you
?
Or
the
sweatshops
of
Korea
,
or
the
rip-off
merchants
in
Hong
Kong
?
A
trip
East
may
be
just
what
you
need
.
"
Yes
.
"
But
she
sounded
less
than
convinced
.
They
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
,
then
he
looked
meaningfully
at
the
whisky
bottle
.
"
Shall
I
have
another
drink
?
Or
am
I
going
to
be
driving
?
"
She
laughed
shortly
but
it
came
out
as
a
half-sob
.
"
Oh
Nick
,
what
would
I
do
without
you
?
"
"
That
is
the
first
time
I
've
heard
you
admit
it
,
"
he
said
ruefully
.
"
You
generally
seem
to
manage
by
yourself
very
well
.
"
She
did
not
answer
.
"
Well
?
"
he
pressed
her
.
"
Do
I
have
that
other
drink
or
not
?
"
She
reached
for
the
bottle
and
half
filled
his
tumbler
.
"
Have
the
bloody
drink
,
Nick
.
And
please
-
I
would
like
you
to
stay
.
"
At
first
she
slept
,
heavy
,
exhausted
,
whisky-induced
sleep
.
Then
suddenly
she
was
wide
awake
,
nerves
jangling
again
,
thoughts
chaotic
.
She
eased
herself
out
of
Nick
's
embrace
and
he
did
not
stir
.
How
she
hated
sleeping
in
his
arms
!
Making
love
was
all
very
well
,
pleasant
and
soporific
if
not
exactly
ecstatic
,
but
afterwards
-
she
needed
her
space
.
I
'm
a
bitch
,
she
thought
sometimes
.
I
use
Nick
shamelessly
and
I
do
n't
like
myself
for
it
.
But
he
's
got
no
one
to
blame
but
himself
.
He
allows
me
to
do
it
.
If
I
were
a
man
I
'd
tell
me
to
get
lost
-
and
fast
!
Tonight
,
however
,
she
had
no
room
for
such
introspection
.
There
were
other
things
on
her
mind
.
She
eased
herself
out
from
under
the
duvet
,
reaching
for
her
heavy
wool
man
's
dressing
gown
and
tying
it
firmly
around
her
,
crossed
to
the
window
.
It
had
stopped
snowing
now
and
the
sky
was
clear
and
black
with
a
few
stars
.
Beneath
her
window
she
could
see
the
white
humps
of
the
pot
in
her
backyard
-
pots
that
in
summer
she
filled
with
geraniums
and
petunias
in
an
effort
to
bring
some
colour
to
the
uniform
greyness
,
beyond
them
the
wall
that
bordered
the
yard
was
also
white-crusted
.
A
familiar
scene
,
yet
one
that
had
changed
subtly
since
yesterday
-
just
as
everything
else
had
been
changed
by
that
newspaper
item
,
the
whole
of
her
life
being
undermined
making
her
feel
that
nothing
was
quite
as
it
had
seemed
.
In
one
way
,
of
course
,
Nick
had
been
quite
right
when
he
had
said
that
whatever
the
truth
it
made
no
difference
.
There
was
no
going
back
now
,
no
way
to
rewrite
the
years
as
she
had
known
them
.
And
they
had
been
good
years
.
With
a
child
's
resilience
she
had
quickly
adjusted
to
the
loss
of
her
mother
,
who
had
never
been
more
than
a
glamorous
appendage
on
the
periphery
of
her
world
,
and
Sally
had
stepped
in
to
fill
the
breach
more
than
adequately
.
Now
,
looking
back
with
the
wisdom
of
adulthood
,
she
could
appreciate
what
she
had
taken
for
granted
at
the
time
.
The
moment
the
news
had
broken
Sally
had
been
there
,
comforting
her
,
buffering
her
,
cuddling
her
when
she
cried
.
There
was
a
warmth
about
Sally
that
superseded
all
her
amusing
little
vanities
and
softened
the
acid
remarks
she
was
prone
to
making
-
which
were
in
reality
a
defence
mechanism
.
Sally
had
a
great
capacity
for
love
and
a
down-to-earth
quality
that
Harriet
presumed
was
a
throw-back
to
her
early
upbringing
and
which
had
been
honed
and
tested
in
the
fire
when
she
had
given
birth
to
-
and
kept
-
an
illegitimate
son
in
the
days
when
illegitimacy
was
still
a
scandal
.
To
Harriet
Sally
had
become
a
surrogate
mother
and
after
she
had
married
Hugo
that
position
had
been
strengthened
so
that
Harriet
had
felt
secure
and
loved
,
never
questioning
her
importance
to
the
people
who
were
important
to
her
.
Although
the
glamorous
world
of
fashion
and
wealth
spread
wide
around
her
,
Harriet
's
own
family
circle
was
tight
-
her
father
,
Sally
,
and
Sally
's
illegitimate
son
,
Mark
Bristow
.
Mark
had
been
educated
in
England
and
later
decided
to
live
there
,
and
it
had
been
because
of
him
that
Harriet
had
first
decided
to
come
to
London
,
though
nowadays
she
saw
little
of
him
.
He
was
in
advertising
;
he
and
his
partner
,
Toby
Rogers
,
had
their
own
agency
,
and
paradoxically
Mark
had
spent
most
of
the
last
year
back
in
the
States
.
He
was
there
now
,
setting
up
some
important
job
or
other
.
Had
he
not
been
she
might
have
telephoned
him
instead
of
Nick
,
when
she
had
been
desperate
for
company
.
But
then
again
,
she
might
not
.
In
a
way
Mark
was
too
close
to
home
,
too
much
a
part
of
the
world
whose
foundations
had
just
been
rocked
,
yet
somehow
on
the
outside
.
No
matter
what
the
truth
might
turn
out
to
be
it
would
not
affect
Mark
.
The
foundations
upon
which
his
life
were
built
were
intact
.
Winds
of
change
might
blow
around
him
but
his
basics
were
not
under
threat
.
Beneath
the
duvet
Nick
stirred
,
flinging
his
arms
across
the
empty
space
where
Harriet
should
have
been
.
She
stood
stock
still
,
hoping
he
would
drift
off
to
sleep
once
more
without
realising
she
was
not
there
.
But
after
a
moment
he
turned
over
again
,
mumbling
thickly
:
"
Harri
?
Where
are
you
?
"
"
I
'm
here
,
"
she
hissed
.
"
Go
back
to
sleep
.
"
"
What
are
you
doing
out
of
bed
?
You
'll
catch
your
death
.
"
"
No
I
wo
n't
.
"
His
concern
irritated
her
.
Was
n't
that
what
she
had
wanted
,
though
?
Someone
to
be
here
,
to
care
about
her
?
So
why
now
did
the
very
fact
that
he
was
awake
and
talking
to
her
seem
like
an
invasion
of
her
privacy
?
"
Come
back
to
bed
,
love
.
"
"
I
'm
all
right
.
"
"
No
,
you
're
bloody
not
!
"
He
got
out
of
bed
,
exclaiming
as
the
cold
air
enveloped
his
warm
sleepy
frame
.
"
Christ
,
this
place
is
like
an
icebox
!
Has
n't
your
heater
come
on
?
"
"
I
do
n't
have
one
in
the
bedroom
,
Nick
.
It
's
healthier
not
to
.
"
"
Healthier
!
To
catch
bloody
pneumonia
!
"
He
caught
her
,
steering
her
back
to
the
bed
,
bundling
her
in
,
dressing
gown
and
all
.
She
allowed
him
to
do
it
though
her
irritation
mounted
.
She
could
n't
ask
him
to
stay
then
yell
at
him
for
caring
for
her
.
She
lay
stiffly
as
he
huddled
close
,
sharing
the
warmth
.
"
I
was
thinking
,
"
she
said
into
his
shoulder
.
"
Not
now
,
"
he
protested
.
"
There
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
that
tomorrow
.
"
"
No
,
there
wo
n't
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
've
made
up
my
mind
,
Nick
.
I
have
to
try
and
learn
the
truth
.
If
Mom
is
still
alive
I
have
to
find
her
.
If
she
's
not
,
well
-
"
He
did
not
answer
.
"
I
'm
going
home
,
"
she
said
.
"
On
the
first
available
flight
.
I
'm
sorry
.
"
"
Do
n't
be
sorry
.
I
suppose
you
'll
do
what
you
have
to
do
.
"
"
Yes
.
"
"
Only
one
thing
-
be
sure
you
take
your
camera
with
you
.
"
She
laughed
softly
.
"
Oh
Nick
,
always
first
and
foremost
the
editor
!
"
"
Always
that
.
"
There
was
regret
in
his
sleepy
voice
.
She
was
growing
warmer
now
and
drowsier
.
With
the
decision
made
she
felt
a
kind
of
temporary
peace
.
"
All
right
,
Nick
,
"
she
murmured
.
"
I
'll
take
my
camera
with
me
.
"
"
Promise
?
"
"
I
promise
.
"
She
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
he
was
thinking
not
so
much
of
the
next
photo
story
she
would
submit
to
him
as
the
necessary
therapy
it
might
provide
.
A
journey
into
the
past
,
with
skeletons
rattling
in
cupboards
at
every
dark
turning
,
was
almost
bound
to
be
upsetting
.
Nick
,
with
his
unfailing
journalist
's
instinct
,
felt
in
his
bones
that
this
one
would
be
more
traumatic
than
most
.
In
his
office
high
up
in
the
twenty-five
storey
building
that
is
550
Fashion
Avenue
,
mecca
of
the
New
York
fashion
industry
,
Hugo
Varna
sat
at
his
desk
and
fiddled
with
the
executive
toy
Sally
had
bought
for
him
last
Christmas
.
It
was
a
stupid
thing
,
he
thought
,
three
gold
baubles
on
springs
that
set
up
a
continual
motion
,
banging
one
against
the
other
,
and
he
kept
it
on
his
desk
only
to
please
her
.
But
today
with
his
mind
too
preoccupied
to
work
he
seemed
quite
unable
to
keep
his
hands
off
it
.
It
clicked
irritatingly
and
Hugo
pushed
it
aside
,
swivelling
his
chair
around
to
face
the
window
and
the
panoramic
view
of
Manhattan
.
Hugo
Varna
's
showrooms
occupied
an
entire
floor
of
the
550
building
and
from
the
moment
a
potential
client
stepped
out
of
the
brass
elevator
she
was
treated
to
an
ambience
of
unashamed
luxury
.
The
vast
foyer
was
carpeted
in
the
softest
green
imaginable
,
the
walls
were
even
paler
,
so
that
at
first
glance
they
might
have
been
taken
for
white
,
and
the
venetian
blinds
were
a
perfectly
blended
shade
of
moss
.
The
minimum
of
furniture
emphasised
the
impressive
size
of
the
foyer
-
only
small
modern
tables
bearing
huge
smoked
glass
ash
trays
,
two
or
three
low
chairs
and
a
huge
arrangement
of
dried
ferns
and
foliage
in
shades
of
brown
and
gold
graced
the
enormous
expanse
.
From
cunningly
concealed
speakers
piped
music
wafted
,
but
music
played
so
softly
that
it
was
almost
inaudible
to
the
human
ear
,
a
faint
teasing
melody
that
soothed
the
soul
and
created
a
restful
atmosphere
almost
without
one
being
aware
of
it
.
This
soft
green
womb
formed
an
oasis
of
peace
in
the
chaotic
tumble
that
was
Fashion
Avenue
.
Outside
in
the
street
the
traffic
might
roar
,
here
there
was
hush
broken
only
by
that
soft
subliminal
music
,
outside
the
air
might
be
heavy
with
the
mingled
smells
of
petrol
fumes
and
donuts
,
Macdonalds
'
burgers
,
trash
cans
,
and
sweat
,
here
there
was
just
the
faintest
perfume
of
a
pine
pot-pourri
,
subtle
as
the
music
.
Even
the
bustling
atmosphere
of
the
550
building
itself
seemed
not
to
have
invaded
the
Hugo
Varna
floor
.
Here
the
sales
staff
glided
about
with
languid
grace
more
reminiscent
of
Paris
than
New
York
,
the
house
models
managed
to
look
like
elegant
advertisements
for
Varna
even
after
a
long
session
of
standing
stock
still
while
a
toile
was
pinned
and
draped
and
adjusted
around
them
,
and
even
when
a
rail
of
sample
clothes
had
to
be
wheeled
across
the
hallowed
expanse
of
green
,
carefully
hidden
inside
grey
and
black
sample
bags
to
make
sure
they
were
safe
from
the
photographic
eye
of
a
fashion
spy
,
it
was
managed
with
what
Hugo
referred
to
as
"
panache
"
.
"
The
simplest
of
jobs
can
be
done
with
panache
"
,
he
would
instruct
whenever
one
of
his
staff
fell
short
of
his
standards
of
perfection
-
the
standards
that
endeared
him
to
his
"
Shiny
Set
"
customers
and
staff
alike
.
Hugo
himself
was
lithe
,
elegant
and
charming
with
a
slight
edge
of
fascinating
middle-European
foreignness
that
came
from
his
Bulgarian
father
.
But
it
was
his
own
formidable
talent
that
set
him
apart
.
Mostly
nowadays
Hugo
took
for
granted
all
the
assets
that
talent
had
brought
him
.
Twenty
years
at
the
pinnacle
of
his
profession
had
paid
him
handsomely
and
he
accepted
the
accolades
and
the
financial
rewards
as
no
more
than
his
due
.
But
on
occasions
he
stopped
in
his
tracks
to
wonder
just
what
he
was
doing
here
,
amidst
all
this
elegance
and
opulence
,
numbering
the
rich
and
famous
and
powerful
amongst
his
clients
-
and
his
friends
.
Not
bad
for
the
son
of
a
penniless
illegal
immigrant
,
he
thought
then
,
not
bad
for
a
boy
raised
on
the
wrong
side
of
town
.
"
Where
exactly
do
you
hail
from
,
Hugo
?
"
Margie
Llewellyn
,
the
chat-show
queen
,
had
asked
him
once
when
she
had
interviewed
him
,
and
he
had
mesmerised
her
millions
of
viewers
with
the
story
he
had
told
.
His
father
,
a
seaman
,
had
jumped
ship
to
seek
a
better
life
when
Bulgaria
had
been
on
the
brink
of
civil
war
in
the
1920s
.
He
had
taken
the
name
of
Varna
from
the
name
of
the
port
from
which
he
had
sailed
but
he
had
lived
his
life
in
terror
of
deportation
,
a
fear
that
had
haunted
him
long
after
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
real
threat
,
so
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
enjoy
his
son
's
success
,
seeing
it
only
as
something
which
drew
unwelcome
attention
to
the
Varna
family
.
Hugo
had
been
perfectly
happy
to
talk
at
length
on
the
Margie
Llewellyn
Show
about
the
days
when
he
had
played
on
the
streets
of
the
Bronx
,
and
how
in
this
unlikely
setting
a
talent
for
sketching
had
developed
into
an
interest
in
designing
clothes
.
Apart
from
his
father
,
Hugo
's
family
had
consisted
entirely
of
women
-
his
mother
,
his
three
sisters
,
his
maternal
grandmother
and
various
assorted
aunts
and
cousins
all
of
whom
(
his
mother
excepted
)
had
striven
to
dress
with
what
Hugo
would
later
call
"
panache
"
on
a
pittance
.
He
had
taken
far
more
interest
in
their
efforts
than
his
father
had
thought
was
right
and
proper
for
a
boy
and
when
Leonie
,
his
eldest
sister
,
had
been
apprenticed
to
a
dressmaker
his
fascination
had
grown
.
From
sketching
the
outfits
she
made
to
inventing
designs
of
his
own
was
but
a
short
step
and
by
the
time
he
left
High
School
he
knew
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
do
.
His
sisters
,
all
working
by
this
time
,
supported
him
through
a
course
at
the
New
York
Fashion
Institute
of
Technology
.
They
were
inordinately
proud
of
him
,
if
slightly
puzzled
by
their
unusually
talented
brother
.
When
he
graduated
Hugo
took
a
succession
of
low-paid
jobs
in
7th
Avenue
and
the
optimism
with
which
he
had
set
out
began
to
be
dimmed
by
the
sheer
sick-making
banality
of
what
he
had
to
do
-
cutting
samples
in
the
disgusting
fabrics
with
which
the
greedy
cutthroat
manufacturers
he
worked
for
made
their
living
.
But
all
the
while
he
was
learning
and
soon
the
time
had
come
when
he
was
no
longer
satisfied
to
design
for
others
.
He
began
cutting
his
own
samples
on
his
mother
's
kitchen
table
and
getting
them
made
up
by
his
sister
and
her
friends
at
the
dressmaker
's
where
she
worked
.
The
situation
could
not
last
,
of
course
.
One
day
Leonie
's
employer
had
got
wind
of
what
was
going
on
,
sacked
Leonie
and
placed
a
telephone
call
to
Victor
Nicholson
,
the
ignorant
,
ill-tempered
manufacturer
Hugo
was
contracted
to
at
the
time
.
A
distraught
Leonie
tried
unsuccessfully
to
contact
Hugo
to
warn
him
and
the
first
he
knew
of
the
debâcle
was
when
he
was
summoned
to
Nicholson
's
cramped
stale-tobacco
smelling
office
.
The
moment
he
walked
in
at
the
door
he
knew
something
was
very
wrong
.
Nicholson
,
who
could
often
be
found
reading
cartoon
comics
at
this
time
of
day
,
was
pacing
the
untidy
office
like
a
caged
lion
,
his
face
and
his
thick
neck
suffused
ugly
puce
above
the
none-too-white
collar
of
his
shirt
.
As
Hugo
entered
the
office
he
whirled
round
,
blundering
into
his
flimsy
chair
and
almost
overturning
it
.
"
What
the
hell
is
going
on
,
eh
,
you
little
runt
?
You
trying
to
ruin
me
,
is
that
it
?
"
Totally
taken
by
surprise
Hugo
could
only
stare
.
Nicholson
reached
across
the
desk
,
grabbing
Hugo
by
the
lapels
and
pulling
him
towards
him
.
"
Do
n't
stand
there
looking
like
Shirley
Bloody
Temple
.
You
know
what
I
'm
talking
about
.
You
've
been
cheating
me
,
you
stinking
ass
hole
,
letting
me
pay
you
for
second-rate
designs
while
you
market
the
best
ideas
yourself
.
"
Hugo
understood
then
.
He
began
to
shake
,
not
because
he
was
physically
afraid
of
Nicholson
,
though
the
man
was
twice
his
size
,
but
because
he
could
suddenly
see
his
world
falling
apart
around
him
.
He
'd
taken
a
chance
and
he
'd
been
found
out
.
"
I
suppose
this
means
you
want
me
to
leave
,
"
he
said
with
what
dignity
he
could
,
half-sprawled
across
the
desk
with
his
chin
six
inches
above
the
remains
of
a
take-away
pizza
and
a
cardboard
cup
of
coffee
dregs
.
"
Too
right
it
does
.
And
that
's
not
all
.
"
Nicholson
released
him
,
pushing
him
back
so
hard
he
almost
fell
.
"
Now
hear
this
and
hear
it
good
.
I
'm
suing
you
,
Varna
,
for
every
cent
you
've
made
from
your
dirty
little
deals
-
and
for
the
designs
.
They
belong
to
me
-
you
're
under
contract
,
do
n't
forget
.
"
Hugo
snorted
derisively
.
Although
the
very
thought
of
court
action
had
brought
him
out
in
a
cold
sweat
,
the
same
grittiness
which
had
enabled
his
father
to
jump
ship
and
seek
a
new
life
now
came
to
his
rescue
.
"
Waste
your
money
on
lawyers
if
that
's
the
way
you
want
it
,
"
he
retorted
.
"
You
'll
make
a
fool
of
yourself
though
.
Those
designs
are
mine
,
done
in
my
own
time
and
made
up
by
my
own
outworkers
.
You
'd
never
use
them
anyway
.
They
have
too
much
class
for
the
women
who
buy
the
rubbish
you
produce
.
"
Nicholson
had
turned
such
a
deep
shade
of
purple
Hugo
thought
he
was
about
to
suffer
a
stroke
.
"
Get
out
of
here
!
"
he
yelled
.
"
I
do
n't
want
to
see
your
ass
around
here
again
-
understand
?
Get
out
!
"
Hugo
had
got
out
.
He
had
left
the
squalid
little
office
that
afternoon
never
to
return
.
It
was
the
most
important
thing
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
,
he
had
told
Margie
Llewellyn
,
and
across
a
nation
the
rich
and
famous
,
the
elegant
and
the
glittering
society
women
who
were
his
clients
wholeheartedly
echoed
the
sentiment
.
Nicholson
had
never
carried
out
his
threat
to
sue
,
though
Hugo
had
endured
some
worrying
weeks
waiting
to
see
if
papers
would
be
served
on
him
,
and
the
experience
had
made
him
determined
never
to
work
for
the
likes
of
Nicholson
again
.
His
early
ventures
into
freelance
design
had
been
reasonably
successful
;
with
Leonie
's
encouragement
he
worked
long
hours
as
a
restaurant
porter
to
earn
enough
money
to
buy
a
couple
of
ancient
industrial
machines
which
he
set
up
at
one
end
of
the
living
room
of
his
mother
's
house
.
Soon
the
place
was
alive
with
their
busy
whirr
as
Leonie
and
one
of
her
friends
stitched
samples
;
to
their
accompaniment
Hugo
worked
on
new
designs
.
The
story
of
this
far
from
illustrious
beginning
was
one
Hugo
never
tired
of
telling
,
for
the
fact
that
he
had
started
with
nothing
but
raw
talent
and
stubborn
determination
was
something
of
which
he
was
justifiably
proud
but
he
was
less
forthcoming
about
what
had
happened
next
.
When
Margie
had
mentioned
his
association
with
Greg
Martin
,
the
financier
who
had
made
him
the
loan
which
had
set
him
up
in
a
small
showroom
and
enabled
him
to
move
the
sewing
machines
out
of
the
living
room
and
into
a
work
room
,
Hugo
became
not
so
much
evasive
as
totally
silent
.
Without
a
doubt
it
had
been
Greg
's
backing
which
had
propelled
him
into
the
big
league
;
without
him
,
for
all
his
talent
,
Hugo
might
have
been
trapped
in
small-time
design
and
manufacture
for
ever
.
But
the
very
mention
of
Greg
Martin
's
name
was
painful
to
Hugo
.
He
had
skilfully
evaded
Margie
's
questions
,
moving
on
to
talk
instead
about
Kurt
Eklund
,
the
financial
genius
he
had
hired
after
Greg
's
death
to
help
him
avoid
what
had
seemed
at
the
time
almost
certain
ruin
.
It
had
been
Kurt
who
had
set
up
the
dozens
of
licensing
deals
for
menswear
and
toiletries
,
bedlinen
and
beachwear
,
soft
furnishings
and
costume
jewellery
,
all
bearing
the
name
of
Hugo
Varna
,
which
had
not
only
saved
him
from
bankruptcy
but
also
made
him
his
first
million
.
In
the
process
Kurt
had
graduated
from
business
adviser
to
trusted
friend
;
Hugo
had
rewarded
him
with
a
fifteen
per
cent
share
of
the
business
and
never
regretted
it
.
Margie
had
not
pressed
Hugo
to
talk
about
Greg
Martin
though
her
professional
instincts
had
nagged
at
her
that
if
she
could
probe
a
little
into
the
association
it
would
produce
some
riveting
television
.
But
she
also
sensed
how
deep
Hugo
's
hurt
ran
and
since
his
first
wife
's
death
was
also
connected
with
the
man
she
told
herself
it
would
be
tasteless
to
dwell
on
it
.
The
truth
was
,
of
course
,
that
hard-nosed
journalist
though
she
was
,
Margie
was
as
attracted
to
Hugo
as
was
almost
every
other
woman
who
met
him
and
she
actually
wanted
him
to
like
her
.
The
momentary
weakness
had
bothered
her
for
weeks
afterwards
as
she
worried
as
to
whether
she
had
lost
her
professionalism
along
with
the
opportunity
to
grill
Hugo
Varna
over
the
truth
about
his
relationship
-
and
Paula
's
-
with
the
man
who
had
died
as
he
lived
in
a
blaze
of
publicity
.
But
whether
she
had
been
right
or
wrong
,
Hugo
had
been
allowed
off
the
hook
.
He
did
not
talk
about
Greg
Martin
.
He
did
not
even
think
about
Greg
Martin
if
he
could
help
it
.
As
he
left
the
studio
after
the
interview
his
well-programmed
defence
mechanism
had
come
into
operation
,
and
he
had
pushed
the
painful
memories
into
a
corner
of
his
brain
where
his
conscious
mind
could
not
reach
them
.
Now
,
however
,
to
his
intense
discomfort
,
Hugo
found
there
was
no
way
he
could
prevent
himself
from
thinking
about
Greg
Martin
.
From
the
moment
the
news
had
broken
that
he
was
not
dead
at
all
but
very
much
alive
in
Australia
he
had
been
unable
to
think
of
anything
else
.
None
of
the
usual
tricks
for
shutting
off
memory
would
work
now
;
whatever
he
did
,
whichever
way
he
diverted
his
attention
it
would
only
come
wandering
back
,
like
a
man
in
a
maze
who
continually
finds
himself
back
in
the
same
spot
.
It
was
insufferable
-
awful
.
He
was
beginning
to
think
he
was
going
mad
.
His
nerves
jangled
in
time
with
the
balls
on
the
executive
toy
on
his
desk
and
his
brain
felt
as
thick
and
muzzy
as
the
grey
January
sky
above
the
skyscrapers
of
Manhattan
.
A
slight
commotion
in
the
outer
office
attracted
his
attention
.
His
secretary
's
voice
,
raised
in
agitation
:
"
I
'm
sorry
-
Mr
Varna
is
not
to
be
disturbed
.
You
ca
n't
go
in
there
!
"
And
another
voice
,
one
he
instantly
recognised
:
"
Like
hell
I
ca
n't
!
"
The
door
flew
open
and
Harriet
burst
in
.
Behind
her
the
secretary
floundered
helplessly
.
"
I
'm
sorry
,
Mr
Varna
,
I
could
n't
stop
her
.
"
"
It
's
all
right
,
Nancy
.
This
is
my
daughter
.
"
"
Oh
,
Mr
Varna
,
I
'm
so
sorry
-
"
she
stuttered
,
even
more
horrified
by
her
gaffe
than
she
had
been
about
letting
a
strange
woman
push
her
way
into
the
holy
of
holies
.
Nancy
Ball
had
only
been
with
Hugo
for
a
few
months
and
it
was
much
longer
than
that
since
Harriet
had
visited
him
at
the
office
.
It
had
simply
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
young
woman
in
a
ski
jacket
with
faded
jeans
tucked
into
her
boots
might
actually
be
Hugo
Varna
's
daughter
!
"
Do
n't
worry
about
it
,
Nancy
,
"
he
said
comfortingly
.
"
You
were
n't
to
know
.
"
She
retreated
,
casting
one
last
flustered
glance
at
Harriet
.
Sally
,
Hugo
's
wife
,
was
always
so
beautifully
turned
out
,
while
this
girl
was
-
well
,
frankly
almost
scruffy
!
Women
simply
never
turned
up
at
the
showrooms
of
one
of
America
's
top
designers
dressed
like
that
,
and
with
practically
no
make-up
.
Hugo
's
daughter
!
Well
!
well
!
"
Dad
-
I
had
to
come
,
"
Harriet
said
as
the
door
closed
after
the
secretary
.
"
You
've
heard
the
news
,
of
course
.
"
"
Yes
.
"
Even
without
the
simple
affirmation
his
face
would
have
given
her
the
answer
;
he
looked
pale
and
drawn
,
as
if
he
had
slept
even
less
than
she
had
.
"
I
tried
to
call
you
but
there
was
no
reply
from
your
flat
.
"
"
I
was
in
Paris
on
a
job
.
I
saw
a
newspaper
there
.
I
rushed
back
to
London
,
packed
a
few
fresh
things
and
came
straight
here
.
"
"
Harriet
-
I
'm
so
sorry
.
"
"
Why
should
you
be
sorry
?
"
"
It
must
have
been
a
terrible
shock
for
you
-
"
"
And
for
you
!
"
she
said
hotly
.
"
After
all
this
time
-
it
's
almost
unbelievable
.
Do
you
suppose
there
's
any
truth
in
it
?
"
He
spread
his
hands
helplessly
.
"
I
wish
I
knew
.
But
I
ca
n't
see
why
anyone
should
invent
a
story
like
that
.
"
"
Maybe
she
's
some
kind
of
nut
.
"
"
Maybe
.
But
as
you
said
,
Harri
,
it
's
such
a
long
time
ago
.
Most
people
have
forgotten
all
about
Greg
Martin
.
I
ca
n't
imagine
what
would
prompt
this
woman
to
dredge
it
all
up
if
there
was
n't
some
truth
in
it
.
I
can
think
of
a
dozen
men
of
much
more
recent
notoriety
if
she
was
simply
inventing
it
for
some
cranky
reason
of
her
own
.
Besides
-
"
He
broke
off
,
staring
for
a
moment
at
the
glinting
gold
balls
,
then
raising
his
eyes
to
meet
Harriet
's
directly
,
"
if
you
look
at
the
past
,
it
's
quite
feasible
that
she
knew
Greg
.
There
was
a
connection
.
"
"
You
knew
her
?
"
Harriet
asked
,
surprised
.
"
No
,
but
I
know
of
her
family
.
"
"
Who
is
she
then
?
The
paper
said
she
was
Italian
,
did
n't
it
?
"
"
That
's
right
.
Her
family
were
fabric
manufacturers
with
mills
and
factories
around
Lake
Como
.
Greg
was
working
on
some
kind
of
deal
in
Italy
not
long
before
he
-
before
the
accident
.
It
's
quite
conceivable
they
were
involved
in
it
and
he
met
Maria
as
a
result
.
He
swept
her
off
her
feet
,
I
should
n't
wonder
.
"
His
lip
curled
in
a
bitter
smile
.
"
He
was
very
attractive
to
women
,
was
Greg
.
"
Harriet
ignored
the
implication
.
"
But
Dad
-
twenty
years
!
If
it
's
true
and
he
is
alive
where
has
he
been
all
this
time
?
And
why
the
hell
should
he
have
pretended
to
be
dead
if
he
was
n't
?
"
"
Because
I
guess
it
suited
him
.
"
Hugo
ran
a
finger
under
the
roll
collar
of
his
shirt
.
It
felt
tight
and
hot
in
spite
of
being
made
of
the
softest
combed
cotton
.
"
He
left
one
hell
of
a
mess
behind
him
,
Harriet
.
"
"
Financial
difficulties
,
you
mean
?
"
"
And
some
!
Oh
yes
,
he
'd
overstretched
himself
,
all
right
.
And
there
was
the
suggestion
of
fraud
,
too
.
It
took
months
-
and
the
best
financial
brains
in
New
York
-
to
unravel
his
dealings
and
what
they
found
was
a
web
of
debt
-
and
worse
.
What
a
time
that
was
!
"
His
eyes
darkened
at
the
memory
.
"
For
a
while
I
thought
we
'd
go
down
because
of
it
.
If
it
had
n't
been
for
Kurt
I
would
have
done
.
He
rescued
me
,
not
a
doubt
of
it
,
and
thank
God
he
did
.
But
as
for
Greg
-
I
suppose
you
could
say
I
was
all
kinds
of
a
fool
to
trust
him
,
but
I
'm
a
designer
,
not
an
accountant
.
And
I
was
n't
the
only
one
taken
in
by
him
-
far
from
it
.
There
were
plenty
of
others
with
more
experience
in
these
matters
than
I
who
were
deceived
.
Oh
yes
,
if
Greg
had
been
around
when
the
storm
broke
he
'd
have
faced
ruin
-
and
probably
gone
to
gaol
into
the
bargain
.
No
doubt
about
it
,
he
made
a
very
timely
exit
one
way
or
the
other
.
"
Harriet
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
chewing
on
her
thumbnail
.
So
-
Greg
had
been
little
better
than
a
crook
on
the
business
front
-
and
he
had
very
nearly
dragged
her
father
-
and
his
stupendous
talent
-
down
with
him
.
She
had
suspected
as
much
,
though
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
Greg
's
death
had
been
anything
but
an
accident
.
But
important
as
all
this
might
once
have
been
it
did
not
concern
her
now
.
Hugo
had
weathered
that
particular
storm
with
Kurt
's
help
and
backing
.
No
one
had
charged
him
with
anything
more
serious
than
naivety
and
now
he
was
one
of
the
most
successful
fashion
designers
in
New
York
.
Besides
,
business
dealings
never
figured
very
largely
in
Harriet
's
reckoning
.
There
were
other
,
far
more
important
aspects
to
life
-
and
death
.
"
Greg
is
only
half
the
story
though
is
n't
he
,
Dad
?
"
she
said
quietly
.
His
eyes
narrowed
,
emphasising
the
small
lines
and
creases
around
them
.
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
"
Oh
Dad
!
"
she
remonstrated
.
"
You
know
very
well
what
I
mean
.
What
about
Mom
?
"
He
looked
away
.
"
What
about
her
?
"
"
Dad
-
come
out
from
that
clam
shell
of
yours
.
I
know
how
good
you
are
at
hiding
away
inside
it
when
you
do
n't
want
to
face
up
to
the
real
world
.
But
it
's
out
here
and
it
wo
n't
go
away
.
"
"
Your
mother
is
dead
"
,
he
said
flatly
.
"
Is
she
though
?
"
Harriet
shook
her
head
slowly
.
"
We
do
n't
really
know
that
any
more
do
we
?
We
were
always
led
to
believe
there
were
no
survivors
when
the
Lorelei
blew
up
.
Now
it
seems
that
was
n't
the
case
.
If
this
Maria
Vincenti
is
to
be
believed
,
Greg
survived
.
So
I
repeat
-
what
happened
to
Mom
?
"
"
Harriet
-
"
He
leaned
on
his
desk
wearily
,
not
looking
at
her
.
"
It
's
so
long
ago
now
.
"
"
What
difference
does
that
make
?
Twenty
weeks
-
twenty
months
-
twenty
years
-
the
questions
are
still
the
same
and
they
have
to
be
answered
.
If
we
do
n't
ask
them
someone
else
will
.
The
insurance
people
are
already
starting
to
probe
.
One
of
them
came
to
see
me
last
night
when
I
got
back
from
Paris
.
He
wanted
to
know
when
I
last
saw
Mom
.
"
He
blanched
visibly
.
"
Bastards
!
I
was
afraid
of
something
like
this
.
So
they
think
-
yes
,
I
suppose
they
would
.
What
did
you
tell
him
?
"
"
That
I
'd
never
seen
her
from
that
day
to
this
,
of
course
.
But
that
's
no
longer
enough
,
is
it
?
For
God
's
sake
what
happened
when
the
Lorelei
blew
up
?
And
what
happened
afterwards
?
Do
n't
you
want
to
know
?
Dad
-
stop
fiddling
with
that
damned
desk
toy
and
listen
to
me
!
"
He
straightened
,
whirling
round
on
her
suddenly
,
much
as
he
had
turned
on
Victor
Nicholson
all
those
years
ago
.
Gone
was
the
vagueness
,
gone
the
composure
.
His
eyes
were
bright
now
with
suppressed
passion
and
pain
.
"
No
,
Harriet
,
you
listen
to
me
.
There
are
some
things
best
left
alone
-
some
things
it
's
better
not
to
know
.
"
"
But
the
explosion
might
not
have
been
an
accident
,
"
she
persisted
.
"
Have
you
thought
of
that
?
It
would
explain
how
Greg
manages
to
be
in
one
piece
while
the
Lorelei
is
nothing
but
a
few
planks
of
driftwood
.
And
If
what
you
say
about
the
state
of
his
finances
is
true
then
he
'd
have
every
reason
for
faking
his
death
to
escape
the
music
.
But
it
does
n't
answer
my
question
.
What
happened
to
Mom
?
"
"
Your
mother
is
dead
.
"
"
So
you
keep
saying
.
It
's
almost
as
if
you
want
to
believe
it
.
"
"
Perhaps
I
do
.
"
His
voice
was
tired
.
"
Perhaps
even
that
is
preferable
to
thinking
she
could
just
disappear
and
let
us
think
she
was
dead
.
"
"
But
Dad
-
"
"
How
would
you
feel
if
you
discovered
that
was
the
case
?
That
she
could
abandon
you
-
her
four-year-old
child
-
and
never
see
you
again
?
Is
that
what
you
want
to
hear
?
"
"
No
,
of
course
not
!
"
"
There
are
things
I
hoped
you
'd
never
find
out
,
Harriet
,
"
he
said'
.
"
But
I
see
now
there
's
no
point
in
hiding
them
any
longer
.
Besides
,
you
are
a
grown
woman
now
,
and
I
dare
say
the
truth
will
come
out
whether
I
tell
you
or
not
.
Your
mother
was
having
an
affair
with
Greg
Martin
.
She
was
besotted
by
him
.
When
she
followed
him
to
Italy
I
believe
she
had
already
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
us
and
go
to
him
.
That
was
why
what
happened
on
the
boat
makes
very
little
difference
to
me
.
Whether
she
was
killed
or
not
is
almost
immaterial
.
As
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
she
was
dead
to
me
the
moment
she
walked
out
the
door
.
"
Harriet
crossed
to
the
window
and
looked
out
.
The
towers
of
Manhattan
seemed
almost
to
be
touching
the
cold
grey
sky
.
Far
below
,
in
the
street
opposite
the
550
building
,
stood
the
tall
statue
of
the
Garment
Worker
,
strangely
distorted
from
this
angle
,
and
around
the
plinth
on
which
it
stood
ant-like
figures
of
vagrants
and
layabouts
sat
,
oblivious
to
the
cold
.
For
long
minutes
Harriet
stared
down
,
unseeing
.
It
was
not
her
father
's
revelation
of
an
affair
that
surprised
her
.
The
official
story
had
always
been
that
Greg
was
simply
a
close
family
friend
,
but
a
child
could
have
seen
through
the
pretence
and
she
had
not
been
a
child
for
a
very
long
time
,
perhaps
not
since
that
long-ago
night
when
she
was
four
years
old
and
had
stood
,
unseen
,
outside
a
bedroom
door
-
No
,
it
was
her
father
's
attitude
that
had
shocked
her
.
"
She
was
dead
to
me
,
"
he
had
said
and
she
could
see
he
meant
it
.
She
was
used
to
his
ostrich
ways
-
his
ability
to
bury
his
head
in
the
sand
and
shut
out
the
things
that
displeased
or
upset
him
.
But
all
the
same
-
Harriet
gave
her
head
a
small
shake
,
hardly
able
to
believe
that
even
he
could
be
quite
so
coldly
dismissive
.
"
Could
I
have
a
drink
?
"
she
requested
.
"
Coffee
?
I
'll
buzz
Nancy
.
"
"
No
-
a
proper
drink
.
The
alcoholic
sort
.
"
She
broke
off
with
a
short
laugh
.
"
Do
n't
look
at
me
like
that
,
Dad
.
This
may
be
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
to
you
,
to
me
it
's
evening
-
and
the
end
of
a
very
long
day
.
"
"
Whisky
?
Bourbon
?
"
he
asked
,
opening
the
elegant
black-lacquered
cabinet
.
"
Whisky
,
please
.
Scotch
if
you
've
got
it
-
or
are
you
waving
the
emerald
flag
for
the
benefit
of
certain
up-and:coming
Irish
politicians
of
the
lineage
of
the
closest
thing
we
in
the
States
have
to
a
royal
family
?
"
"
I
have
Irish
whiskey
,
of
course
-
but
also
Scotch
.
"
He
poured
her
some
and
handed
it
to
her
.
"
I
wo
n't
pretend
it
pleases
me
to
see
you
drinking
it
,
Harriet
.
I
know
you
're
a
grown
woman
but
so
are
most
of
the
others
who
lurch
their
way
down
the
not-so-primrosy
path
to
the
Betty
Ford
Clinic
.
"
"
Dad
!
"
She
rolled
her
eyes
heavenward
.
"
I
know
.
I
sound
like
a
nagging
father
.
But
I
've
seen
a
few
of
them
on
the
slippery
slope
-
the
Shiny
Set
,
the
stars
,
the
Washington
widows
.
"
"
Inadequates
.
"
"
Do
n't
be
so
sure
.
It
gets
a
hold
of
you
,
Harriet
.
"
"
All
right
,
Dad
,
you
've
made
your
point
.
I
wish
I
had
n't
asked
for
the
damned
drink
now
.
But
as
I
said
,
my
body
has
n't
adjusted
to
the
time-lag
yet
.
When
it
does
,
I
promise
not
a
drop
will
pass
my
lips
before
dinner
.
Except
of
course
-
"
she
broke
off
to
toss
back
the
rest
of
the
whisky
and
set
the
tumbler
down
on
Hugo
's
desk
,
"
except
of
course
that
I
do
n't
suppose
I
shall
be
here
long
enough
to
make
the
adjustment
.
"
He
was
unable
to
hide
his
disappointment
.
"
You
're
going
back
to
London
?
"
"
No
.
Not
yet
.
I
'm
going
to
Australia
.
"
"
Australia
?
-
oh
!
"
She
nodded
.
"
Yes
.
I
'm
going
to
try
and
find
Greg
Martin
.
I
'm
sorry
,
Dad
,
but
I
ca
n't
just
let
this
thing
pass
-
sit
back
and
pretend
it
has
n't
happened
.
It
's
very
important
to
me
-
and
,
I
should
have
thought
,
to
you
too
.
It
's
Mom
we
're
talking
about
-
not
a
stranger
in
a
sensational
newspaper
item
-
and
there
are
too
many
unanswered
questions
about
her
death
-
or
her
disappearance
.
If
Greg
Martin
is
alive
then
perhaps
he
is
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
can
supply
the
answers
.
"
"
But
Harriet
,
it
sounds
as
if
he
has
gone
into
hiding
again
.
If
the
police
ca
n't
find
him
what
makes
you
think
you
could
?
And
if
they
have
picked
him
up
he
'll
be
in
custody
.
They
'd
never
let
you
see
him
.
"
Her
mouth
set
in
a
stubborn
line
he
knew
so
well
.
"
You
may
be
right
.
But
I
have
to
try
.
Perhaps
you
do
n't
want
to
know
the
truth
-
that
's
how
it
looks
from
where
I
'm
standing
.
But
I
want
to
know
.
I
want
to
find
out
what
happened
.
Damn
it
-
I
'm
going
to
find
out
!
"
He
shook
his
head
.
"
What
good
do
you
think
will
come
from
it
,
Harriet
?
If
she
is
alive
and
you
find
her
-
do
you
think
that
would
mean
you
'd
have
your
Mom
back
?
Of
course
it
would
n't
.
But
I
honestly
believe
she
is
dead
.
I
have
thought
so
for
a
very
long
time
.
"
"
If
that
is
so
then
it
is
all
the
more
important
to
find
out
the
truth
,
"
she
said
quietly
.
"
Why
?
What
difference
can
it
make
now
?
"
"
Because
it
seems
as
though
Greg
arranged
the
accident
in
order
to
fake
his
own
death
.
That
's
what
the
woman
alleged
and
what
you
have
said
confirms
it
is
quite
likely
.
But
when
he
sailed
Mom
was
with
him
-
no
dispute
about
that
is
there
?
So
if
he
survived
and
Mom
died
then
-
do
n't
you
see
?
He
murdered
her
.
"
"
Harriet
-
for
God
's
sake
!
"
"
I
'm
sorry
,
Dad
,
but
it
's
true
.
It
has
to
be
a
possibility
.
And
that
is
why
I
'll
see
Greg
Martin
if
it
's
the
last
thing
I
do
.
"
His
eyes
were
distant
.
He
looked
like
an
old
man
suddenly
and
she
realised
how
he
had
aged
since
she
had
seen
him
last
.
Aged
since
yesterday
,
perhaps
?
Never
a
big
man
,
overnight
his
frame
seemed
to
have
become
almost
frail
and
the
sinews
in
his
neck
were
raised
and
stringy
above
the
cotton
roll-neck
.
She
put
her
arms
around
him
.
"
I
do
n't
want
to
upset
you
,
Dad
,
but
I
have
to
do
it
.
You
must
see
that
-
"
She
stopped
speaking
as
the
buzzer
on
his
desk
interrupted
her
.
He
broke
away
,
depressing
the
button
.
"
Yes
,
Nancy
?
What
is
it
?
"
"
I
'm
sorry
to
disturb
you
,
Mr
Varna
,
but
I
have
a
Mr
O'Neill
here
who
says
he
is
from
the
British
and
Cosmopolitan
Assurance
Company
.
He
insists
on
seeing
you
.
"
"
The
man
who
more
or
less
forced
his
way
into
my
flat
last
night
!
"
Harriet
said
grimly
.
"
What
is
he
doing
in
New
York
?
"
"
Come
to
see
me
,
obviously
,
"
Hugo
returned
drily
.
But
his
smile
was
strained
and
Harriet
was
alarmed
by
how
drawn
and
old
lie
suddenly
looked
.
"
Leave
him
to
me
,
Dad
.
I
'll
deal
with
him
.
"
Tom
O'Neill
was
in
the
outer
office
looking
at
one
of
the
pictures
that
lines
the
walls
-
Rena
,
Hugo
's
favourite
house
model
,
wearing
a
loose
cut
trench
coat
over
a
tailored
shirt
and
doe-skin
pants
.
"
Mr
O'Neill
,
I
really
would
prefer
it
if
you
did
n't
bother
my
father
just
now
.
There
is
nothing
he
can
tell
you
beyond
what
I
already
have
-
that
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
my
mother
has
been
dead
for
more
than
twenty
years
.
"
"
Perhaps
.
"
Today
,
in
the
half
daylight
,
half
white
neon
of
the
office
,
his
eyes
managed
to
look
bluer
and
sharper
than
ever
,
like
the
ice-cold
waters
of
a
sunlit
fiord
.
"
Nevertheless
I
am
afraid
I
must
insist
on
seeing
him
,
Miss
Varna
.
"
"
Look
-
he
's
in
no
fit
state
-
"
Harriet
argued
.
"
Why
do
n't
you
go
to
Australia
and
talk
to
the
Vincenti
woman
before
you
start
bothering
us
?
"
"
That
is
my
next
port
of
call
,
"
he
said
easily
.
"
But
right
now
I
am
here
.
So
if
you
would
kindly
tell
your
father
-
"
"
Mr
O'Neill
,
I
'm
telling
you
-
"
"
Quit
trying
to
protect
me
,
Harriet
.
"
Hugo
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
his
office
.
"
I
know
you
are
only
trying
to
help
but
the
sooner
we
get
this
over
with
the
better
.
I
'll
see
Mr
O'Neill
now
.
I
have
nothing
to
hide
.
"
"
Dad
!
"
"
You
go
home
,
Harriet
.
I
'll
see
you
at
dinner
.
And
perhaps
you
'd
warm
Sally
I
might
be
a
little
late
.
"
"
Dad
!
"
"
Come
this
way
,
please
,
Mr
O'Neill
.
"
The
door
closed
after
them
and
Harriet
could
do
nothing
but
glare
at
it
impotently
.
Dammit
,
he
deserved
to
be
reported
to
whatever
professional
body
insurance
investigators
belonged
to
and
if
he
upset
her
father
she
'd
see
to
it
that
he
was
.
Still
fuming
at
the
insensitive
arrogance
of
the
man
she
turned
and
left
the
office
.
In
her
room
at
Hugo
's
Central
Park
triplex
Harriet
was
dressed
and
ready
for
dinner
.
At
home
in
London
she
rarely
bothered
with
such
irrelevances
;
here
she
knew
it
was
expected
of
her
and
accordingly
she
had
showered
,
dumped
her
travel-weary
jeans
into
the
laundry
basket
from
which
they
would
be
rescued
by
a
maid
,
washed
,
ironed
and
returned
to
her
next
day
,
and
dressed
herself
in
a
loose
silk
jersey
jacket
and
pants
suit
,
simple
and
easy
enough
to
please
her
yet
enough
of
a
transformation
to
satisfy
her
father
and
Sally
.
She
was
tired
out
now
,
her
eyes
ached
from
lack
of
sleep
and
jet-lag
,
and
she
glanced
longingly
at
the
king-sized
bed
with
its
lace-trimmed
peach
silk
sheets
.
Oh
to
be
able
to
fall
into
it
and
sink
into
oblivion
!
But
it
would
be
several
more
hours
yet
before
she
could
do
that
.
Was
her
father
home
yet
?
she
wondered
.
She
was
anxious
to
see
him
the
moment
he
arrived
,
and
make
sure
he
was
all
right
after
the
trauma
of
the
interview
with
the
insurance
investigator
.
But
when
she
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
looked
down
she
could
see
that
his
study
door
was
ajar
and
the
house
was
quiet
and
she
returned
to
her
room
.
He
had
said
he
might
be
late
,
after
all
,
and
she
decided
to
snatch
a
few
more
moments
of
privacy
to
recharge
her
batteries
in
the
one
place
in
the
whole
luxurious
house
where
she
was
able
to
relax
and
feel
she
was
her
own
person
.
What
was
it
about
unashamed
luxury
,
Harriet
sometimes
asked
herself
,
which
made
her
feel
so
uncomfortable
?
Most
people
would
be
only
to
happy
to
be
able
to
enjoy
such
surroundings
.
A
top
line
interior
decorator
had
been
given
a
free
hand
when
Hugo
had
bought
the
triplex
two
years
ago
and
no
expense
had
been
spared
-
the
walls
were
hung
with
some
of
Hugo
's
collection
of
Old
Masters
,
glowing
against
the
background
of
watered
silk
,
the
shelves
were
lined
with
leather
bound
first
editions
which
neither
Hugo
nor
Sally
would
ever
open
,
much
less
read
,
every
nook
and
cranny
was
filled
with
treasures
and
objets
d'art
displayed
on
dainty
pedestals
.
The
sofas
and
chairs
were
deep
and
soft
enough
to
fall
asleep
in
,
a
fireplace
was
topped
by
an
Adam
mantel
which
Hugo
had
had
flown
out
from
England
and
everywhere
there
were
fresh
flowers
-
long
stemmed
hothouse
roses
,
orchids
flown
in
from
Singapore
,
daffodils
and
narcissi
and
heavy
perfumed
hyacinths
.
But
to
Harriet
the
grandeur
and
studied
comfort
were
somehow
artificial
,
the
atmosphere
more
reminiscent
of
a
luxury
hotel
than
a
home
.
Perhaps
,
she
thought
,
it
was
because
she
had
never
lived
in
this
house
.
There
was
nothing
to
arouse
childhood
memories
.
Only
in
the
room
Sally
had
chosen
especially
for
her
was
Harriet
amongst
familiar
echoes
of
the
past
and
she
never
entered
it
without
feeling
a
wave
of
gratitude
towards
her
aunt
.
Here
,
at
Sally
's
instigation
,
were
many
of
the
things
Harriet
remembered
and
loved
from
her
childhood
and
growing-up
years
-
the
rosettes
she
had
won
with
her
pony
,
her
graduation
dress
,
her
old
collection
of
Osmond
and
Jackson
records
,
her
early
attempts
at
photography
,
proudly
framed
,
a
pressed
flower
that
reminded
her
of
her
first
proper
date
.
Small
things
,
but
important
,
the
little
touches
that
were
typical
of
Sally
and
which
made
it
possible
to
feel
charity
-
and
love
-
for
her
when
she
was
fussy
or
critical
or
just
plain
annoying
as
she
had
been
when
Harriet
had
arrived
without
warning
this
afternoon
.
"
Why
did
n't
you
let
us
know
you
were
coming
?
"
Sally
had
chided
when
the
taxi
had
dropped
Harriet
off
and
she
had
bundled
unceremoniously
into
the
house
.
"
You
should
have
called
,
darling
,
and
warned
us
.
I
might
have
been
out
or
anything
.
"
"
There
was
n't
time
,
"
Harriet
had
said
,
kissing
her
.
"
And
anyway
,
you
were
n't
out
.
"
"
No
,
but
I
will
be
tomorrow
.
I
have
a
charity
luncheon
to
attend
and
-
"
"
I
probably
wo
n't
be
here
tomorrow
either
.
It
's
a
flying
visit
only
.
"
"
Oh
if
only
I
'd
known
!
I
'd
have
asked
Mark
to
dinner
.
He
's
in
New
York
,
you
know
,
though
he
insists
on
staying
with
a
friend
in
that
dreadful
apartment
over
on
the
West
side
.
He
'd
have
loved
to
see
you
.
"
"
And
I
'd
have
loved
to
see
him
.
But
that
's
not
why
I
'm
here
,
Sally
.
"
"
Why
then
?
Oh
no
,
do
n't
tell
me
.
"
Sally
held
up
a
manicured
hand
.
"
I
do
n't
think
I
want
to
know
.
Your
father
and
I
talked
about
nothing
else
last
night
.
Harriet
,
I
'm
sorry
,
but
I
do
n't
think
I
could
stand
to
begin
going
all
over
that
again
-
not
just
now
.
And
I
think
I
just
might
try
to
get
hold
of
Mark
.
It
might
not
be
too
late
to
invite
him
to
dinner
,
If
he
's
got
nothing
else
planned
.
I
'll
warn
Jane
we
shall
be
at
least
one
,
possibly
two
,
extra
-
"
"
Sally
,
hang
on
a
minute
.
"
Harriet
managed
to
interrupt
her
flow
.
"
I
can
understand
your
reluctance
to
talk
about
what
's
happened
but
you
ca
n't
just
push
it
to
one
side
.
That
's
Dad
's
trick
,
but
it
's
not
like
you
.
"
"
It
's
just
that
I
do
n't
like
wasting
my
energy
worrying
about
things
I
can
do
nothing
about
,
"
Sally
said
matter-of-factly
.
"
Please
,
Harriet
.
I
have
had
it
up
to
here
!
"
She
drew
an
imaginary
line
across
the
base
of
her
throat
,
brushing
her
double-strand
pearl
choker
.
"
Ca
n't
we
just
leave
it
?
"
Harriet
sighed
.
"
No
,
I
do
n't
think
we
can
.
I
called
in
to
see
Dad
before
coming
here
and
while
I
was
there
an
insurance
investigator
called
Tom
O'Neill
came
to
see
him
.
The
same
man
was
at
my
flat
last
night
asking
questions
and
for
all
I
know
his
next
visit
will
be
here
,
to
see
you
,
so
-
"
She
broke
off
.
Sally
's
hand
was
clutching
at
her
pearls
now
and
she
had
turned
very
pale
beneath
her
makeup
.
"
Sally
,
are
you
all
right
?
"
she
asked
swiftly
.
"
An
insurance
investigator
,
you
say
?
"
Sally
repeated
in
a
shocked
voice
.
"
That
's
right
.
There
was
a
big
pay-out
on
Mom
's
life
,
was
n't
there
?
Well
,
the
insurance
company
seem
to
have
got
it
into
their
heads
that
If
Greg
Martin
is
alive
Mom
might
be
too
.
They
're
more
or
less
accusing
us
of
some
kind
of
fraud
.
"
"
My
God
,
"
Sally
said
.
"
It
's
not
the
end
of
the
world
,
"
Harriet
exclaimed
,
irritated
by
Sally
's
uncharacteristic
behaviour
.
"
As
Dad
said
,
we
have
nothing
to
hide
and
hopefully
he
'll
soon
realise
that
and
go
away
.
But
it
's
pretty
unpleasant
,
especially
for
Dad
,
to
have
all
this
raked
up
.
He
's
under
a
terrible
strain
.
"
"
Are
n't
we
all
?
"
Sally
said
faintly
.
"
Perhaps
,
but
it
's
different
for
us
,
"
Harriet
said
,
mindful
of
what
her
father
had
told
her
.
"
She
was
his
wife
,
after
all
.
"
"
And
your
mother
.
And
my
sister
.
"
"
Yes
,
I
know
that
.
But
all
the
same
-
I
think
we
should
do
all
we
can
to
support
him
.
Sally
,
are
you
listening
to
what
I
'm
saying
?
"
Sally
was
staring
into
space
,
still
plucking
at
her
pearl
choker
in
agitation
.
A
tiny
muscle
was
working
near
her
mouth
,
making
her
lip
tremble
.
"
I
knew
something
like
this
would
happen
,
"
she
whispered
.
"
It
's
what
I
've
been
afraid
of
.
"
Harriet
stared
at
her
.
"
I
suppose
it
's
inevitable
,
"
she
conceded
.
"
But
there
's
no
point
getting
so
worked
up
about
it
.
I
just
wanted
to
warn
you
,
that
's
all
.
And
to
ask
you
to
support
Dad
.
"
"
Yes
.
"
Sally
collected
herself
.
"
I
expect
you
'd
like
to
bath
and
change
,
Harriet
.
You
must
be
exhausted
.
And
I
was
going
to
try
to
get
hold
of
Mark
.
I
'll
ask
Danny
to
bring
up
your
things
.
"
"
It
's
all
right
,
I
can
manage
them
.
Do
n't
bother
Danny
.
"
Danny
was
the
chauffeur
.
Harriet
picked
up
her
hold-all
and
escaped
.
She
was
puzzled
by
Sally
's
reaction
.
Anger
,
yes
,
she
'd
expected
that
.
But
Sally
had
seemed
really
upset
,
not
at
all
her
usual
contained
self
.
She
was
getting
quite
neurotic
,
Harriet
reflected
,
and
the
same
thought
occurred
to
her
now
as
she
checked
her
image
in
the
full
length
mirror
,
tucking
her
camisole
top
more
neatly
in
at
the
waist
of
her
pants
and
straightening
the
ornamental
clasp
of
the
loose
belt
she
had
fastened
around
her
hips
.
She
only
hoped
Sally
was
able
to
get
hold
of
Mark
.
It
would
be
nice
to
see
him
and
his
presence
would
lighten
things
.
Mark
always
managed
to
be
deliciously
irreverent
,
no
matter
how
heavy
things
got
.
It
was
the
English
in
him
,
she
supposed
,
that
laid-back
refusal
to
take
himself
-
or
anyone
else
-
seriously
.
Somewhere
in
the
house
a
telephone
was
ringing
.
Harriet
took
no
notice
of
it
but
a
minute
or
two
later
there
was
a
tap
at
her
door
and
a
maid
stood
there
with
one
of
the
portable
receivers
-
there
was
no
extension
in
Harriet
's
room
.
"
For
me
?
"
she
asked
,
surprised
.
The
maid
nodded
.
Harriet
waited
until
the
door
had
closed
after
her
and
flicked
the
button
,
feeling
oddly
apprehensive
.
The
last
thirty-six
hours
had
held
too
many
unpleasant
shocks
for
comfort
.
"
Hello
?
"
"
Harriet
-
it
's
me
.
"
"
Nick
!
"
"
Hi
.
I
'm
just
about
to
go
to
bed
and
I
thought
I
'd
ring
and
see
how
things
are
with
you
.
"
"
Oh
,
I
'm
fine
.
"
"
You
arrived
safely
then
?
"
He
sounded
so
close
he
might
almost
have
been
in
the
next
room
instead
of
the
other
side
of
the
Atlantic
ocean
.
"
Yes
.
I
've
seen
Dad
and
we
shall
soon
be
having
dinner
.
"
"
Good
.
Tired
,
I
expect
?
"
"
Exhausted
.
"
"
But
otherwise
all
right
?
"
"
Yes
.
"
There
was
a
silence
.
There
was
really
nothing
else
to
say
.
"
I
wo
n't
keep
you
then
.
I
just
thought
I
'd
let
you
know
I
was
thinking
of
you
.
"
"
Thanks
,
Nick
,
it
was
sweet
of
you
.
"
"
OK
.
Take
care
then
,
Harriet
.
And
keep
in
touch
.
"
The
slight
sense
of
claustrophobia
he
could
always
arouse
in
her
stirred
.
"
Yes
.
Goodnight
,
Nick
.
Thanks
again
for
ringing
.
"
Then
he
was
gone
and
she
held
the
receiver
for
a
moment
feeling
unexpectedly
bereft
.
He
was
so
good
to
her
.
So
caring
.
Why
could
n't
she
let
him
in
to
that
private
part
of
herself
that
sometimes
cried
out
for
-
what
?
But
she
could
n't
.
Nick
was
there
for
her
and
she
was
grateful
,
but
that
was
all
.
The
moment
she
knew
it
she
did
n't
want
him
any
more
,
simple
as
that
.
What
the
hell
is
the
matter
with
me
?
Harriet
wondered
briefly
.
She
glanced
at
her
watch
.
Half
an
hour
or
so
to
dinner
.
She
might
as
well
go
down
,
have
a
pre-dinner
drink
with
Sally
and
see
if
her
father
was
home
yet
.
Halfway
down
the
stairs
she
heard
voices
and
through
the
partly-open
drawing-room
door
caught
a
glimpse
of
Sally
in
peacock-blue
cashmere
and
the
tall
figure
of
a
young
man
,
fine
hair
above
a
chestnut
brown
suede
jacket
.
Her
heart
leaped
and
she
ran
the
rest
of
the
way
like
a
child
in
her
delight
.
"
Mark
!
Oh
,
it
's
so
good
to
see
you
!
"
"
Hey
,
steady
!
"
He
set
down
his
glass
and
hugged
her
.
"
Fancy
you
being
in
New
York
too
.
What
a
turn-up
for
the
books
!
"
"
I
know
.
But
I
had
to
come
.
You
've
heard
the
news
,
of
course
.
"
"
Yes
.
I
talked
to
Sally
on
the
telephone
last
night
.
It
must
have
come
as
one
hell
of
a
shock
for
you
,
Skeeter
.
"
It
was
his
nickname
for
her
;
he
had
started
calling
her
that
when
she
was
small
and
it
had
stuck
even
though
she
was
now
a
respectable
five-feet-seven
.
"
For
all
of
us
.
"
She
glanced
at
Sally
,
but
her
aunt
seemed
to
have
regained
her
composure
.
"
Is
Dad
home
yet
?
"
"
No
.
I
hope
he
's
not
going
to
be
much
longer
.
"
"
I
left
him
with
an
insurance
investigator
,
"
Harriet
explained
to
Mark
.
"
Mark
-
get
Harriet
a
drink
,
"
Sally
said
.
"
I
'm
going
to
ask
Jane
to
hold
dinner
back
a
bit
.
"
She
hurried
out
,
but
not
before
Harriet
had
seen
the
haunted
look
was
back
in
her
eyes
.
"
What
will
you
have
,
Skeeter
?
"
Mark
asked
.
"
Oh
-
better
make
it
Martini
.
I
've
already
had
one
telling-off
from
Dad
today
for
drinking
Scotch
.
If
he
finds
me
at
it
again
he
'll
be
convinced
I
'm
on
the
slippery
slope
.
"
"
Right
.
"
He
poured
it
for
her
and
watched
with
one
eyebrow
raised
as
she
gulped
at
it
.
"
It
's
all
been
a
bit
bloody
,
I
gather
.
"
"
Yep
.
"
She
brought
him
up
to
date
with
what
had
happened
.
"
Your
mother
seems
to
have
taken
it
pretty
badly
"
,
she
concluded
.
"
Yes
,
she
does
look
a
bit
grey
for
her
does
n't
she
?
Of
course
she
was
very
close
to
Paula
,
I
understand
.
Anyway
,
let's
talk
about
something
quite
different
.
What
have
you
been
up
to
?
"
She
told
him
about
Paris
and
her
new
assignment
for
Focus
Now
.
"
And
what
about
you
?
"
she
asked
.
"
How
is
the
advertising
business
?
"
"
Booming
.
I
think
I
've
just
sewn
up
a
deal
on
a
new
account
.
"
"
Good
for
you
!
"
She
looked
at
him
over
the
top
of
her
glass
.
"
You
're
spending
a
good
deal
of
time
in
New
York
now
,
Mark
.
I
thought
you
were
in
love
with
London
.
"
"
I
'm
in
love
with
wherever
the
business
is
.
And
at
the
moment
it
's
in
New
York
.
"
"
Are
you
sure
that
's
the
real
reason
?
It
's
not
that
you
're
deliberately
staying
away
from
London
by
any
chance
is
it
?
"
He
tossed
back
his
drink
.
"
Now
why
should
I
do
that
?
"
"
Oh
I
could
think
of
several
reasons
.
"
She
eyed
him
shrewdly
.
"
But
I
think
the
most
likely
is
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
a
girl
.
"
The
moment
she
said
it
she
knew
she
had
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
It
was
there
in
his
expression
though
he
feigned
bored
impatience
.
"
Now
why
the
hell
should
you
think
that
?
"
"
Feminine
intuition
.
Who
was
it
,
Mark
?
What
went
wrong
?
You
must
have
cared
an
awful
lot
about
her
to
deliberately
stay
away
from
London
because
of
her
.
Now
wait
a
minute
-
it
would
n't
be
that
young
fashion
designer
,
would
it
?
The
one
with
the
place
over
in
Whitechapel
?
"
He
set
his
glass
down
sharply
.
"
What
do
you
know
about
her
?
"
"
Nothing
really
.
Just
that
someone
told
me
you
'd
been
seeing
her
.
It
is
her
,
is
n't
it
?
Oh
come
on
,
Mark
,
you
can
tell
me
!
"
"
Has
n't
it
occurred
to
you
,
Skeeter
,
that
I
might
not
want
to
?
Being
my
step-sister
does
n't
give
you
a
God-given
right
to
know
all
my
business
.
"
His
tone
was
still
laconic
but
she
heard
the
undertones
and
was
warned
.
Mark
could
bite
If
upset
-
and
of
course
he
was
quite
right
,
she
should
n't
pry
into
what
was
none
of
her
business
.
"
Sorry
,
"
she
said
.
"
It
's
all
right
.
"
But
he
still
looked
a
little
spiky
.
The
girl
must
have
given
him
the
elbow
,
Harriet
decided
.
Most
unusual
-
where
Mark
was
concerned
it
was
usually
the
other
way
round
.
"
Shall
we
have
another
drink
?
"
he
suggested
.
She
hesitated
,
then
pushed
her
glass
towards
him
.
"
Why
not
?
If
Dad
is
going
to
brand
me
an
alcoholic
I
might
as
well
have
the
game
as
well
as
the
name
!
"
When
Hugo
returned
home
dinner
was
served
as
soon
as
he
had
had
time
to
change
.
It
was
a
sombre
meal
in
spite
of
Mark
's
presence
.
Hugo
looked
even
more
tired
and
strained
than
he
had
earlier
,
Harriet
thought
,
and
Sally
was
edgy
and
preoccupied
though
she
seemed
greatly
relieved
when
Hugo
told
her
that
the
insurance
investigator
,
Tom
O'Neill
,
had
seemed
satisfied
with
what
he
had
been
able
to
tell
him
and
had
not
expressed
any
desire
for
a
further
interview
or
the
need
to
come
to
the
house
to
speak
to
Sally
.
"
He
tells
me
he
is
going
straight
on
to
Australia
to
see
Greg
,
"
Hugo
said
.
"
Let's
hope
the
whole
thing
ends
there
.
Though
somehow
I
doubt
it
.
"
"
Why
?
Why
should
you
doubt
it
?
"
Sally
demanded
.
Harriet
noticed
her
hands
were
shaking
.
"
Because
the
son
of
a
bitch
wo
n't
let
up
while
he
thinks
there
is
the
slightest
chance
of
getting
back
his
quarter
of
a
million
,
"
Hugo
said
.
"
Then
why
do
n't
you
just
give
it
to
him
?
"
Sally
suggested
.
"
It
would
be
worth
it
,
Hugo
,
to
get
him
off
our
backs
.
"
"
If
that
were
the
case
he
could
have
it
and
welcome
.
But
it
would
simply
look
like
an
admission
of
guilt
and
I
'm
damned
If
I
'm
going
to
do
that
when
I
've
nothing
to
hide
.
"
"
Sydney
,
New
South
Wales
,
"
Harriet
said
irrelevantly
.
They
all
looked
at
her
questioningly
and
she
explained
:
"
I
was
just
thinking
aloud
"
.
"
You
're
not
still
entertaining
this
foolish
idea
of
going
to
Australia
to
try
to
see
Greg
Martin
yourself
,
I
hope
,
"
Hugo
said
sharply
.
"
Yes
"
,
Harriet
said
.
"
I
am
.
I
'm
sorry
,
Dad
,
but
I
ca
n't
see
it
the
way
you
do
.
I
'm
not
prepared
to
simply
brush
it
under
the
carpet
and
try
to
pretend
it
has
n't
happened
.
I
want
to
find
out
the
truth
.
"
"
For
goodness
"
sake
,
Harriet
,
do
n't
do
anything
so
foolish
-
"
Sally
had
turned
pale
again
.
"
You
do
n't
want
to
see
Greg
!
"
"
It
'll
be
a
wasted
journey
.
If
he
's
in
police
custody
as
he
may
well
be
by
now
they
'll
never
let
her
see
him
,
"
Hugo
said
.
"
I
intend
to
try
.
"
"
All
I
can
say
is
I
hope
you
were
n't
too
rude
to
that
insurance
investigator
then
,
"
Mark
put
in
drily
.
"
If
you
want
to
see
Greg
then
he
's
got
to
be
your
best
chance
.
You
should
persuade
him
to
let
you
pose
as
his
secretary
or
something
.
"
"
Oh
for
heaven
's
sake
,
Mark
,
do
you
have
to
make
everything
into
a
joke
?
"
Harriet
demanded
.
"
I
'm
not
joking
-
I
'm
perfectly
serious
.
He
'll
be
given
access
to
Martin
,
I
should
think
.
He
is
a
professional
investigator
,
after
all
.
"
"
I
would
n't
ask
him
for
help
if
I
were
on
a
sinking
ship
and
he
was
the
only
one
with
a
lifebelt
!
"
Harriet
said
decisively
.
At
that
moment
Sally
knocked
over
her
glass
of
wine
.
It
ran
in
a
red
river
across
the
polished
table
top
and
cascaded
onto
her
peacock-blue
cashmere
skirt
.
She
leaped
up
,
dabbing
at
it
with
a
napkin
.
"
Oh
no
!
It
'll
be
ruined
!
I
must
take
it
off
at
once
and
give
it
to
Donna
so
that
she
can
rinse
it
-
"
She
hurried
from
the
room
.
"
Sally
is
in
one
hell
of
a
state
,
"
Mark
said
easily
.
"
This
business
has
made
her
really
jumpy
.
She
's
not
herself
at
all
.
"
"
Is
it
surprising
?
"
Hugo
snapped
.
"
I
should
have
thought
anyone
with
a
grain
of
sensitivity
would
realise
how
painful
it
is
for
all
of
us
to
have
this
all
raked
up
again
.
as
if
it
was
n't
bad
enough
for
us
to
live
through
it
once
-
"
Harriet
stood
up
.
"
I
'll
go
and
see
if
she
's
all
right
.
I
do
n't
want
any
more
dinner
.
I
am
honestly
not
hungry
.
"
"
Neither
I
think
are
any
of
us
,
"
Hugo
observed
.
In
her
room
Sally
eventually
managed
to
get
out
of
her
dress
though
her
hands
were
trembling
so
much
she
had
great
difficulty
with
the
zipper
.
Then
she
kicked
it
away
and
sank
onto
the
bed
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
.
God
in
heaven
,
where
was
this
nightmare
going
to
end
?
Was
it
really
only
the
day
before
yesterday
when
everything
had
been
so
pleasant
and
normal
?
When
she
had
been
able
to
plan
her
charity
lunches
and
her
dinner
parties
,
go
shopping
,
gossip
with
friends
,
look
at
her
life
and
know
that
at
last
she
had
achieved
all
she
had
ever
wanted
,
even
If
sometimes
it
was
a
little
lonely
,
a
little
empty
?
Now
in
every
corner
,
wherever
she
looked
,
the
ghosts
of
the
past
seemed
to
be
congregating
to
mock
her
until
she
felt
sure
she
must
be
going
mad
.
A
tap
at
the
door
and
without
waiting
for
her
answer
it
opened
a
fraction
.
"
Sally
?
"
It
was
Harriet
s
voice
,
Harriet
s
anxious
face
peeping
round
.
"
Are
you
all
right
?
"
"
Yes
.
"
Somehow
she
got
a
hold
of
herself
and
went
to
pick
up
her
dress
.
"
How
could
I
be
so
clumsy
?
"
"
You
're
upset
.
Let
me
take
the
dress
to
Donna
while
you
find
something
else
to
put
on
.
"
Sally
let
her
take
it
.
Then
before
she
could
stop
herself
she
asked
:
"
You
're
not
really
going
to
Australia
are
you
,
Harriet
?
"
"
Yes
,
I
am
.
"
Sally
caught
at
her
arm
.
"
Do
n't
go
,
darling
,
please
.
You
never
know
,
you
might
find
out
something
you
'd
rather
not
know
.
"
Harriet
's
brows
came
together
in
a
puzzled
little
line
.
"
Dad
said
something
similar
.
You
're
afraid
,
both
of
you
,
that
I
might
discover
Mom
is
n't
dead
at
all
,
are
n't
you
?
"
Sally
said
nothing
,
and
Harriet
went
on
:
"
You
do
n't
really
think
she
could
do
something
like
that
,
do
you
?
Disappear
and
let
us
all
think
she
was
dead
if
she
was
n't
?
"
For
a
moment
Sally
did
not
answer
.
"
Your
mom
was
a
very
determined
lady
when
she
wanted
something
,
"
she
said
,
avoiding
Harriet
's
eyes
.
"
She
usually
got
it
one
way
or
another
.
"
"
You
mean
you
do
think
-
Sally
,
she
was
your
sister
,
dammit
!
"
"
Yes
"
,
Sally
said
softly
.
"
She
was
my
sister
all
right
.
"
She
crossed
to
one
of
her
closets
,
sliding
hangers
along
the
rail
.
"
Go
back
to
the
others
,
Harriet
.
I
'm
all
right
.
I
'll
be
down
in
a
minute
.
"
For
a
moment
longer
Harriet
hesitated
,
then
she
nodded
.
"
If
you
're
sure
you
're
all
right
.
"
"
Yes
,
really
.
Go
along
with
you
.
"
The
door
closed
after
Harriet
,
and
Sally
rifled
through
her
wardrobe
looking
for
a
dress
of
mauve-sprigged
white
seersucker
,
slightly
yellowed
now
,
and
quite
out
of
place
amongst
the
designer
gowns
.
She
should
have
thrown
it
out
years
ago
but
somehow
she
'd
never
had
the
heart
.
She
'd
loved
that
dress
,
felt
so
grown
up
in
it
!
She
slipped
it
off
its
hanger
and
held
it
against
herself
and
it
was
almost
as
if
the
face
looking
back
at
her
from
the
mirror
across
it
was
fourteen
years
old
again
.
As
she
stood
there
holding
it
the
memories
came
flooding
back
-
and
not
all
of
them
pleasant
.
For
she
had
been
wearing
this
dress
the
night
she
had
first
glimpsed
the
truth
about
her
sister
,
a
truth
that
was
as
unpalatable
now
as
it
had
been
then
.
"
Oh
Paula
!
"
she
whispered
and
suddenly
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
,
making
rivulets
in
her
carefully-applied
make-up
.
"
What
happened
to
you
?
And
dear
God
,
what
happened
to
me
?
"
She
stood
quite
still
,
holding
the
dress
with
arms
folded
around
her
waist
,
and
remembered
.
As
she
climbed
the
stairs
Sally
could
hear
the
low
voices
and
the
giggles
coming
from
the
bedroom
she
shared
with
her
sister
and
knew
what
it
meant
.
Paula
had
brought
her
friend
Louise
home
with
her
and
they
would
be
sharing
the
sort
of
older-girl
talk
that
always
made
Sally
feel
like
an
intruder
-
and
a
very
gauche
,
childish
intruder
at
that
.
She
hesitated
,
torn
between
the
unaccountable
shyness
she
always
felt
in
Louise
's
presence
and
the
overwhelming
desire
to
be
in
on
whatever
it
was
they
were
giggling
about
,
even
if
she
was
only
a
barely
tolerated
spectator
.
Fascination
with
the
older
girls
won
just
as
it
always
did
and
she
crossed
the
landing
,
an
expanse
of
lino
dotted
with
what
her
mother
referred
to
as
"
slip
mats
"
,
pushed
open
the
door
and
went
in
.
Two
pairs
of
accusing
eyes
focused
on
her
.
Paula
,
wearing
tight
pedal
pushers
and
a
cotton
off-the-shoulder
jersey
,
was
sprawled
on
her
elbows
on
the
tiled
fire-surround
,
smoking
and
puffing
the
smoke
up
the
chimney
whilst
Louise
,
stripped
to
her
sexy
black
lace
underwear
,
was
lying
on
the
bed
pounding
at
her
thighs
with
some
kind
of
massager
which
appeared
to
consist
of
a
collection
of
rubber
pimples
on
a
brush
head
.
"
Sally
!
What
are
you
doing
here
?
"
Paula
demanded
.
"
It
's
my
room
too
,
"
Sally
said
defensively
.
"
I
can
come
in
if
I
like
.
"
"
Oh
you
're
such
a
nuisance
!
Go
and
listen
to
the
radio
or
something
.
"
"
There
's
nothing
on
the
radio
.
I
want
to
get
a
book
.
"
"
Well
hurry
up
and
leave
us
alone
.
"
"
Oh
,
cherie
,
do
n't
be
so
hard
on
her
!
"
Louise
said
,
still
pounding
away
at
what
she
considered
to
be
her
fat
legs
.
Louise
was
French
and
luscious
,
as
every
male
in
the
district
between
the
ages
of
fourteen
and
eighty-four
would
testify
-
most
from
wishful
thinking
but
quite
a
number
from
experience
.
Louise
was
what
was
known
as
an
"
exchange
student
"
;
at
home
in
Nîmes
she
was
training
to
be
an
English
teacher
and
she
was
doing
a
year
's
exchange
as
part
of
her
course
,
teaching
French
conversation
at
the
local
grammar
school
.
She
and
Paula
,
who
was
in
the
sixth
form
,
had
struck
up
a
close
relationship
;
when
Louise
was
not
occupied
in
tantalising
and
inflaming
some
poor
young
man
she
and
Paula
were
always
together
,
drinking
endless
cups
of
espresso
coffee
to
the
accompaniment
of
Elvis
and
Cliff
and
Tommy
Steele
on
the
juke-box
in
the
Black
Cat
Coffee
Bar
,
haring
about
on
Louise
's
smart
little
Lambretta
scooter
,
or
simply
spending
an
evening
painting
one
another
's
toenails
,
plucking
one
another
's
eyebrows
and
generally
trying
to
make
themselves
even
more
fatally
attractive
to
the
opposite
sex
,
which
,
without
doubt
,
they
already
were
.
"
You
are
not
kind
to
your
little
seester
!
"
Louise
said
reprovingly
.
"
Do
n't
stand
in
the
doorway
,
Sally
,
come
in
.
Come
in
quickly
or
the
smell
of
smoke
will
go
downstairs
,
will
it
not
?
"
"
Oh
no
!
"
Paula
wailed
.
"
If
Mum
finds
out
I
've
been
smoking
she
'll
kill
me
.
Do
n't
you
dare
tell
her
either
,
Sally
,
or
I
'll
kill
you
!
"
"
Of
course
I
wo
n't
tell
.
But
she
's
bound
to
smell
the
smoke
anyway
.
"
"
She
wo
n't
.
It
's
going
up
the
chimney
.
And
if
you
stay
you
're
not
to
tell
her
what
we
're
talking
about
either
.
Go
on
.
Louise
,
you
were
telling
me
about
Roger
Clarke
.
Is
he
a
fast
worker
?
Everybody
says
he
is
.
"
Louise
giggled
.
"
'ee
theenks
'ee
is
.
But
I
could
teach
'im
a
thing
or
two
.
All
he
wants
to
do
is
to
get
his
hand
inside
my
blouse
or
up
my
skirt
,
but
if
I
gave
him
the
chance
to
do
anything
more
he
'd
be
so
scared
he
'd
wet
his
pants
.
"
"
You
would
n't
let
him
though
,
would
you
?
"
"
I
might
.
And
then
again
I
might
not
.
"
Louise
gave
her
thigh
one
more
enthusiastic
pummel
,
then
sat
up
.
"
There
-
that
ees
better
.
Do
you
want
a
go
with
this
theeng
,
Paula
?
"
"
No
,
it
's
made
your
legs
go
all
red
.
"
"
That
will
soon
go
.
And
it
's
better
than
being
fat
.
But
then
,
you
are
not
fat
,
are
you
,
Paula
?
"
She
gazed
enviously
at
Paula
's
long
legs
,
slim
and
shapely
in
the
skin-tight
pedal
pushers
.
"
What
about
you
,
Sally
?
Do
you
want
to
try
?
"
"
Do
n't
encourage
her
,
"
Paula
warned
.
"
Why
not
?
Why
should
n't
Sally
look
nice
too
?
"
She
turned
to
Sally
,
who
was
kneeling
in
the
corner
beside
her
bookcase
,
trying
to
make
herself
unobtrusive
.
"
Come
on
,
Sally
,
let
me
look
at
you
.
You
'ave
fat
legs
like
me
.
We
big
girls
must
stick
together
.
"
Sally
was
unsure
whether
to
be
pleased
that
Louise
was
including
her
or
annoyed
that
she
had
called
her
fat
.
She
was
n't
fat
,
but
then
neither
was
Louise
,
so
perhaps
it
was
all
right
.
She
slipped
out
of
her
cotton
skirt
and
the
enormously
full
paper
nylon
petticoat
she
wore
beneath
it
.
It
lay
like
a
great
wounded
butterfly
on
the
rug
.
Then
she
sat
on
the
bed
,
trying
not
to
wince
as
Louise
rubbed
cream
into
her
thighs
and
pounded
at
them
enthusiastically
.
"
What
are
you
wearing
to
the
youth
club
dance
on
Saturday
night
,
Louise
?
"
Paula
asked
,
stubbing
out
her
cigarette
and
concealing
the
end
in
an
empty
lozenge
tin
she
used
as
an
ashtray
.
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
-
"
The
older
girls
drifted
off
into
one
of
their
exclusive
conversations
and
Sally
bit
her
lip
against
the
rasp
of
Louise
's
massager
and
wished
desperately
that
she
could
go
to
the
youth
club
dance
too
.
Not
only
would
it
make
her
feel
almost
as
grown
up
as
Paula
and
Louise
,
but
Pete
Jackson
,
with
whom
Sally
was
hopelessly
in
love
,
was
certain
to
be
there
.
Pete
was
in
her
form
at
school
and
whenever
she
looked
at
him
little
quivers
she
could
not
identify
started
deep
inside
her
.
Sometimes
she
thought
from
the
way
he
seemed
to
watch
her
that
he
might
like
her
too
but
he
had
never
said
anything
and
Sally
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
he
never
would
.
But
if
they
were
to
meet
away
from
school
,
out
of
uniform
,
no
longer
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the
masters
and
mistresses
in
their
chalk-marked
black
gowns
,
then
maybe
it
would
be
different
.
"
Do
you
think
Mum
would
let
me
come
too
?
"
she
asked
.
"
I
should
n't
think
so
,
"
Paula
said
quickly
.
"
There
is
someone
you
fancy
?
"
Louise
asked
perceptively
,
and
when
Sally
blushed
she
turned
to
Paula
.
"
Oh
,
we
could
tell
your
mother
we
will
look
after
her
.
Then
she
would
let
her
go
,
no
?
"
"
No
!
"
Paula
protested
.
Most
of
her
life
,
it
seemed
to
her
,
she
had
been
hampered
by
having
to
look
after
Sally
and
she
had
no
intention
of
having
her
Saturday
evening
's
fun
spoiled
.
There
was
a
boy
she
fancied
herself
-
Jeff
Freeman
-
and
she
was
busy
laying
plans
to
entice
him
away
from
his
steady
girlfriend
.
The
presence
of
her
kid
sister
would
inhibit
her
horribly
.
"
She
has
n't
got
anything
to
wear
anyway
"
,
she
continued
scathingly
.
"
Then
I
shall
lend
her
something
of
mine
.
We
are
about
the
same
size
,
no
?
I
shall
make
her
so
beautiful
no
boy
will
be
able
to
resist
.
"
She
ran
the
massager
up
the
inside
of
Sally
's
thigh
again
but
suddenly
it
did
not
hurt
any
more
.
As
the
rim
brushed
her
groin
Sally
felt
a
sharp
sweet
pleasure
which
seemed
to
shoot
up
inside
her
on
silken
cords
to
that
deep
core
where
the
trickles
of
excitement
played
every
time
she
thought
of
Pete
.
As
Louise
moved
away
she
experienced
a
powerful
urge
to
grab
the
massager
and
tug
it
close
to
her
secret
places
again
but
she
did
not
dare
.
She
just
lay
thinking
how
wonderful
it
would
be
if
she
could
actually
make
Pete
notice
her
.
It
had
always
seemed
such
an
impossible
dream
,
but
with
Louise
talking
about
it
so
matter-of-factly
it
seemed
almost
a
fait
accompli
.
Much
to
Paula
's
annoyance
Louise
persuaded
Gwen
Bristow
to
allow
Sally
to
go
to
the
dance
.
Sally
was
triumphant
,
but
by
the
time
Saturday
came
she
was
almost
sick
with
excitement
and
apprehension
.
Oh
,
if
only
she
looked
more
like
Paula
!
she
thought
longingly
.
If
only
she
could
lose
her
puppy
fat
and
get
her
hair
done
at
a
proper
salon
instead
of
having
it
cut
by
Ivy
Tucker
who
lived
down
the
road
and
who
did
hairdressing
for
pin
money
.
But
it
was
n't
easy
to
lose
puppy
fat
when
Mum
fed
her
on
stodgy
good
home
cooking
-
stews
with
dumplings
and
meat
pies
with
pastry
crusts
and
steamed
sponge
puddings
,
and
there
was
no
money
to
spare
for
proper
hairdressing
salons
.
Sally
knew
her
mother
had
trouble
making
ends
meet
on
the
nine
pounds
ten
shillings
a
week
that
her
father
brought
home
from
his
job
as
an
electrician
's
mate
and
she
did
n't
have
the
heart
to
plead
for
luxuries
she
knew
they
could
not
afford
as
Paula
did
.
Too
often
she
had
seen
her
mother
frowning
with
anxiety
as
she
divided
the
contents
of
her
father
's
wage
packet
up
between
the
jars
labelled
"
Rent
"
and
"
Electric
"
and
"
Coal
Money
"
,
too
often
at
the
end
of
the
week
she
had
watched
her
count
out
the
pennies
for
a
pound
of
sausages
only
to
be
able
to
buy
just
a
half-pound
,
two
for
her
father
,
one
each
for
Paula
and
Sally
,
and
only
the
scrapings
of
the
pan
to
go
with
her
own
potatoes
.
"
When
I
grow
up
I
'll
make
sure
I
've
always
got
enough
money
for
a
whole
pound
of
sausages
and
eggs
to
go
with
them
,
"
Sally
thought
,
but
she
never
said
anything
.
She
did
not
want
to
add
to
her
mother
's
troubles
.
At
four
o'clock
Louise
arrived
on
her
scooter
and
parked
it
outside
the
Bristows
'
council
house
.
The
house
was
semi-detached
,
which
put
them
on
a
higher
social
level
than
the
people
who
lived
in
the
long
uniform
ranks
,
a
pleasant
,
gravel-faced
house
which
had
been
built
after
the
war
and
which
had
a
good
sized
garden
back
and
front
,
three
bedrooms
,
a
bathroom
-
and
an
outside
toilet
,
coal
house
and
glory
hole
.
Sally
loved
the
house
.
Before
moving
into
it
the
family
had
lived
with
Sally
's
grandparents
and
it
had
been
very
cramped
.
Their
grandparents
had
made
the
lounge
into
a
bedroom
so
that
Grandad
did
n't
have
to
do
the
stairs
with
his
bad
legs
and
a
bedroom
had
been
turned
into
a
sitting
room
and
furnished
with
a
table
,
chairs
and
sideboard
that
her
parents
had
acquired
when
they
got
married
though
they
had
no
house
to
put
it
in
.
When
Paula
and
Sally
played
records
on
the
wind-up
gramophone
in
the
sitting
room
Grandad
banged
on
the
ceiling
with
his
stick
to
warn
them
to
be
quieter
.
After
this
the
council
house
seemed
the
height
of
luxury
to
Sally
.
She
kept
rabbits
in
a
hutch
in
the
back
garden
behind
the
rows
of
cabbages
and
the
clump
of
rhubarb
and
did
not
mind
at
all
that
in
winter
she
had
to
wash
at
night
in
a
bowl
set
on
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
in
front
of
the
living
room
fire
because
there
was
no
heater
in
the
bathroom
.
Louise
was
carrying
a
large
bag
which
she
had
managed
to
balance
on
the
handlebars
of
her
scooter
.
Paula
and
Sally
took
her
straight
up
to
their
bedroom
.
"
Thees
is
the
dress
I
bring
for
you
,
"
she
announced
,
pulling
it
out
of
its
tissue
paper
and
spreading
it
,
slightly
creased
,
on
the
bed
.
"
You
like
it
?
"
"
Oh
yes
!
"
Sally
gasped
.
It
was
a
beautiful
dress
,
white
seersucker
dotted
with
small
mauve
flowers
.
It
had
a
deep
"
sweetheart
"
neckline
,
little
puffed
sleeves
and
a
full
skirt
gathered
into
three
tiers
.
Next
out
of
the
bag
came
a
paper
nylon
petticoat
with
many
more
layers
of
frothy
rainbow-coloured
net
than
the
one
Sally
carefully
washed
in
sugar
water
after
each
wearing
,
and
then
,
to
Sally
's
delight
,
a
saucy
little
white
basque
,
boned
and
trimmed
with
lace
.
"
She
ca
n't
possibly
wear
that
!
"
Paula
exclaimed
,
scandalised
.
"
She
's
much
too
young
-
and
it
will
never
fit
her
,
anyway
.
"
"
Of
course
it
will
.
It
fits
me
.
And
with
this
dress
she
needs
a
tiny
waist
.
Why
ca
n't
she
wear
it
?
"
"
You
could
have
lent
it
to
me
,
"
Paula
said
,
peeved
.
"
No
,
it
is
for
Sally
.
Please
try
it
on
,
Sally
.
"
Sally
held
her
breath
as
Louise
fastened
the
multitude
of
little
hooks
and
eyes
and
tried
not
to
notice
the
little
roll
of
fat
that
squeezed
out
above
and
below
it
.
"
Now
the
petticoat
.
"
It
rustled
satisfyingly
.
"
And
the
dress
-
well
,
what
do
you
think
,
Sally
?
"
Sally
tipped
the
dressing
table
mirror
to
get
a
view
first
of
her
top
half
,
then
her
lower
.
"
It
's
lovely
-
but
what
about
shoes
?
Mine
are
clumsy
and
awful
.
"
Louise
dived
into
her
carrier
bag
again
.
"
Voila
!
"
she
said
,
producing
a
pair
of
strappy
white
sandals
.
Sally
squeezed
her
feet
into
them
and
surveyed
her
image
again
.
Unbelievable
!
Just
wait
until
Pete
saw
her
!
He
was
certain
to
ask
her
to
dance
when
she
looked
like
this
!
"
Now
-
your
hair
,
"
Louise
said
matter-of-factly
.
"
We
will
make
it
wet
and
put
it
in
rags
.
It
will
be
dry
by
the
time
we
leave
for
the
dance
.
"
Sure
enough
,
it
was
.
When
the
rags
came
out
the
mass
of
frizz
made
Sally
screech
with
horror
but
when
Louise
had
teased
it
a
little
with
her
Mason
Pearson
brush
and
a
long
tail
comb
Sally
saw
that
the
usually
severe
schoolgirlish
cut
had
been
transformed
into
a
mop
of
pretty
curls
.
Paula
and
Louise
were
looking
lovely
too
-
Paula
in
a
little
white
top
with
a
boat
shaped
neck
and
a
bright
turquoise
circular
skirt
,
Louise
in
a
figure
hugging
number
which
left
none
of
her
curves
to
the
imagination
-
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
Sally
felt
she
could
compete
with
them
on
equal
terms
.
"
Be
sure
to
come
straight
home
after
the
dance
.
And
make
sure
you
stay
together
,
"
Grace
warned
.
Paula
pursed
her
lips
and
tossed
her
head
,
looking
annoyed
.
But
Sally
scarcely
noticed
.
By
nine-thirty
the
dance
was
in
full
swing
.
As
it
was
a
special
fundraising
dance
instead
of
the
regularly
fortnightly
hop
,
a
three-piece
band
had
been
brought
in
to
replace
the
usual
stack
of
gramophone
records
and
there
was
"
real
food
"
-
fishpaste
sandwiches
,
sausage
rolls
and
cheese
and
pineapple
on
sticks
-
which
the
"
committee
"
had
spent
the
entire
afternoon
preparing
.
Paula
and
Louise
had
been
nominated
to
sell
the
raffle
tickets
and
did
a
round
of
the
hall
,
flirting
outrageously
and
telling
all
the
boys
the
tickets
were
"
sixpence
each
or
two
shillings
a
strip
"
.
Naturally
most
of
the
boys
opted
for
"
the
strip
"
and
each
time
the
innuendo
was
made
the
girls
pretended
it
was
terribly
witty
and
original
,
If
a
little
naughty
,
just
as
they
did
when
they
were
asked
for
the
twentieth
time
if
perhaps
they
might
be
the
prize
.
Selling
the
tickets
gave
Paula
an
opportunity
to
make
her
play
for
Jeff
Freeman
.
She
waited
for
Jean
,
his
girlfriend
,
to
go
to
the
Ladies
,
and
then
pounced
,
flirting
madly
and
manoeuvring
him
into
bartering
with
her
that
he
would
buy
two
whole
strips
if
she
would
have
a
dance
with
him
.
Then
without
the
slightest
compunction
she
thrust
her
basin
of
money
and
book
of
tickets
into
Sally
's
lap
and
let
him
drag
her
,
protesting
theatrically
,
onto
the
dance
floor
.
When
Jean
returned
from
the
Ladies
there
was
no
sign
of
either
of
them
,
for
at
the
end
of
the
dance
they
had
slipped
unnoticed
out
of
one
of
the
wide-open
fire
exits
and
around
the
back
of
the
hall
where
only
courting
couples
went
.
Half
an
hour
later
they
were
still
missing
.
When
she
finished
selling
the
remaining
tickets
Sally
looked
around
for
them
,
realised
what
had
happened
and
went
back
to
sit
on
one
of
the
hard
upright
chairs
which
lined
the
hall
.
She
was
feeling
wretched
.
For
her
,
the
evening
had
not
turned
out
at
all
as
she
had
hoped
.
Several
boys
had
asked
her
to
dance
but
she
had
refused
them
all
,
afraid
she
might
miss
her
chance
with
Pete
,
but
he
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
her
at
all
in
spite
of
Louise
's
dress
.
Once
she
had
thought
he
was
coming
in
her
direction
and
her
heart
had
begun
to
pump
with
excitement
but
he
had
walked
straight
past
,
heading
for
the
bar
that
was
selling
soft
drinks
only
(
with
a
crate
of
beer
hidden
under
the
counter
for
the
benefit
of
the
band
)
.
Tears
pricked
her
eyes
and
she
stared
hard
at
the
floor
.
"
Wan
na
dance
?
"
a
voice
enquired
and
Sally
looked
up
to
see
a
boy
in
a
velvet-collared
jacket
,
drainpipes
and
crepe-soled
shoes
standing
in
front
of
her
,
a
lick
of
greasy
hair
falling
across
a
face
shiny
with
perspiration
.
"
No
thank
you
,
"
she
started
to
say
,
then
caught
sight
of
Pete
-
dancing
with
someone
else
.
Her
heart
dropped
like
a
stone
and
somehow
she
got
to
her
feet
.
The
boy
grabbed
her
hand
with
his
sweaty
one
.
She
danced
in
a
haze
of
misery
,
scarcely
noticing
when
the
music
changed
from
vibrant
rock-and-roll
to
"
the
creep
"
and
when
the
lights
were
lowered
and
he
pulled
her
close
she
could
n't
be
bothered
to
protest
though
she
was
revolted
by
the
smell
of
beer
on
his
breath
(
where
had
he
got
it
?
)
mingling
with
strong
body
odours
.
The
teddy-boy
seemed
to
take
her
listlessness
for
acquiescence
.
His
hands
strayed
down
to
a
spot
just
below
the
first
frill
on
her
skirt
and
he
pushed
his
hips
against
hers
so
that
she
could
clearly
feel
the
bulge
between
his
legs
.
Suddenly
it
was
all
to
much
for
Sally
.
She
grabbed
his
hands
and
removed
them
from
her
bottom
.
Then
she
turned
and
fled
from
the
dance
floor
,
pushing
her
way
between
the
smooching
couples
and
heading
for
the
Ladies
,
a
box
of
a
room
with
pegs
lining
two
walls
,
a
flyblown
mirror
over
a
grubby
cracked
china
sink
and
two
cubicles
.
Ignoring
the
girls
who
were
primping
in
front
of
the
mirror
she
ran
to
the
cubicles
and
dived
inside
one
,
slamming
the
door
after
her
and
leaning
against
it
.
What
a
disaster
!
If
only
she
could
just
go
home
,
hide
away
and
never
have
to
see
anyone
again
-
but
she
had
promised
to
stick
with
Paula
and
there
would
be
all
kinds
of
awkward
questions
and
recriminations
if
she
arrived
home
alone
.
High
heels
pattered
across
the
cloakroom
floor
and
someone
pushed
at
the
toilet
door
.
"
Damn
,
"
said
a
voice
outside
.
"
They
're
both
occupied
.
"
"
Never
mind
,
they
wo
n't
be
long
.
"
"
I
have
n't
got
long
.
If
I
do
n't
get
back
and
find
Jeff
soon
it
'll
be
time
for
my
last
bus
and
I
ca
n't
go
without
seeing
him
.
He
is
supposed
to
be
my
boyfriend
,
after
all
.
"
"
Supposed
to
be
.
Some
boyfriend
if
you
ask
me
!
"
Sally
stood
motionless
.
She
had
recognised
the
voices
-
Jean
,
Jeff
's
girl
and
her
friend
,
Peggy
.
"
I
would
n't
stand
for
it
If
I
were
you
,
"
Peggy
was
saying
indignantly
.
"
I
would
n't
let
him
treat
me
like
that
.
"
"
It
's
not
his
fault
.
It
's
that
Paula
Bristow
-
Lady
Muck
herself
.
Who
does
she
think
she
is
?
"
Jean
's
voice
was
rising
;
she
sounded
tearful
.
"
Do
n't
upset
yourself
,
Jean
.
He
's
not
worth
it
.
Nor
is
she
.
She
's
a
fast
cat
.
She
'll
let
the
boys
do
what
they
like
.
That
's
why
they
flock
round
her
.
You
ask
my
brother
.
The
things
he
could
tell
you
about
her
would
make
your
hair
curl
.
She
's
got
no
pride
.
She
just
does
n't
care
.
"
Sally
began
to
quiver
with
anger
.
Forgetting
her
own
misery
and
embarrassment
she
threw
open
the
door
.
"
That
's
my
sister
you
're
talking
about
!
"
For
a
moment
the
two
girls
stared
at
her
,
shocked
,
then
Peggy
recovered
herself
.
"
It
's
true
,
anyway
,
"
she
said
defiantly
.
"
And
you
're
as
bad
as
she
is
!
You
'll
let
any
boy
paw
you
too
.
I
saw
you
just
now
with
Gary
.
His
hands
were
all
over
you
!
"
"
You
're
just
jealous
!
"
Sally
cried
,
her
face
scarlet
.
She
pushed
past
the
girls
and
marched
over
to
the
wastepaper
bin
beneath
the
sink
.
It
was
full
of
used
cloakroom
tickets
,
torn
paper
towel
,
bits
of
face-powdery
cotton
wool
and
the
shavings
of
eyebrow
pencils
.
She
picked
it
up
,
went
back
to
the
two
girls
and
dumped
it
unceremoniously
over
Peggy
's
head
.
Then
she
ran
from
the
cloakroom
,
down
the
narrow
dark
passage
and
out
into
the
night
.
The
sound
of
merriment
emanating
from
the
hall
jangled
her
nerves
,
the
sight
of
the
courting
couples
pressed
against
the
wall
was
enough
to
bring
her
to
the
edge
of
tears
again
.
What
an
evening
!
Bad
enough
that
Pete
did
n't
want
her
.
But
to
overhear
Jean
and
Peggy
saying
those
things
about
Paula
was
somehow
almost
worse
,
for
in
her
heart
Sally
knew
they
were
not
far
removed
from
the
truth
.
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
as
if
the
veil
had
been
stripped
from
her
idol
and
she
was
looking
at
the
real
person
who
hid
away
inside
a
beautiful
body
,
seeing
her
through
the
eyes
of
others
who
had
no
family
love
for
her
to
colour
what
they
saw
.
Paula
was
a
flirt
.
She
did
think
she
was
a
little
bit
better
than
everyone
else
.
And
she
was
prepared
to
go
to
any
lengths
to
get
what
she
wanted
-
and
almost
always
succeeded
.
"
Oh
sugar
!
"
Sally
said
.
And
there
in
the
darkness
,
with
half
an
hour
to
wait
before
she
could
even
start
looking
for
Paula
with
a
view
to
going
home
,
she
began
to
cry
.
After
three
weeks
of
misery
Sally
woke
up
one
morning
and
realised
she
was
no
longer
in
love
with
Pete
.
The
fact
that
her
stomach
no
longer
turned
over
when
he
looked
at
her
came
as
a
surprise
and
disappointment
-
even
unrequited
love
was
better
than
no
love
at
all
.
A
fortnight
after
she
had
made
this
earth-shattering
discovery
she
was
amazed
when
he
stuttered
out
an
invitation
to
the
cinema
.
Hoping
to
rekindle
the
fire
Sally
accepted
,
but
it
was
no
use
.
Close
to
,
she
discovered
,
Pete
smelled
of
carbolic
soap
,
a
dreadful
turn-off
,
and
when
he
kissed
her
in
the
dark
it
was
so
wet
and
sloppy
she
longed
only
to
search
for
her
handkerchief
and
wipe
her
mouth
dry
.
During
the
next
year
Sally
fell
in
and
out
of
love
a
half
dozen
times
and
each
time
it
proved
to
be
just
as
disastrous
.
A
few
boys
asked
her
out
but
never
the
right
ones
,
never
the
ones
she
wanted
to
ask
her
,
and
Sally
began
to
wonder
how
two
people
ever
came
to
be
in
love
with
one
another
at
the
same
time
.
It
was
a
miracle
that
so
many
people
managed
it
-
and
for
long
enough
to
get
engaged
and
married
.
But
perhaps
they
were
luckier
than
she
was
,
or
just
plain
less
fussy
.
Paula
certainly
never
seemed
to
encounter
such
problems
.
She
had
a
string
of
boyfriends
and
no
matter
how
badly
she
treated
them
there
were
always
others
lined
up
and
waiting
.
But
then
of
course
Paula
was
so
lovely
she
had
only
to
look
at
a
boy
to
have
him
crazy
about
her
,
Sally
thought
wretchedly
.
Then
,
in
the
spring
when
she
was
sixteen
,
the
miracle
happened
.
His
name
was
Edward
Blake
and
he
was
nineteen
years
old
-
really
grown
up
!
Besides
this
he
was
stunningly
handsome
.
It
was
the
beginning
of
the
tennis
season
.
As
a
member
of
the
school
team
Sally
was
expected
to
stay
behind
after
school
to
practise
.
One
afternoon
after
an
especially
long
session
she
was
forced
to
catch
a
much
later
bus
home
than
usual
.
She
sprinted
across
the
playground
,
hampered
by
her
satchel
and
tennis
racket
,
just
as
the
bus
was
about
to
pull
away
,
and
leaped
aboard
.
The
bus
was
full
and
the
conductor
grumpy
.
"
Hold
on
tight
now
!
"
he
called
,
ringing
the
bell
.
Sally
staggered
down
the
aisle
,
trying
not
to
bang
the
other
passengers
with
her
tennis
racket
.
"
Let
me
take
that
,
"
said
a
male
voice
and
turning
she
found
herself
looking
into
a
pair
of
startlingly
blue
eyes
.
"
There
's
a
seat
here
,
"
he
went
on
,
moving
to
let
her
in
.
She
sat
down
,
settling
her
satchel
on
her
lap
and
stealing
another
glance
at
him
.
Thick
fair
hair
,
a
wonderful
complexion
-
not
a
sign
of
a
spot
!
-
and
those
blue
eyes
!
Sally
felt
a
little
flush
of
excitement
creeping
up
her
cheeks
and
she
was
acutely
conscious
of
her
gingham
uniform
dress
and
the
beret
which
school
rules
said
must
be
worn
at
all
times
when
outside
the
school
grounds
.
Failure
to
do
so
was
punished
by
being
forced
to
wear
the
hated
beret
for
a
whole
day
in
school
-
for
lessons
,
lunch
,
everything
,
a
badge
of
shame
Sally
had
so
far
managed
to
avoid
.
But
just
now
she
thought
she
would
willingly
endure
any
punishment
if
only
she
dared
take
her
hat
off
without
making
it
perfectly
obvious
she
was
making
a
pass
at
him
.
"
You
are
n't
usually
on
this
bus
,
"
he
said
and
Sally
felt
her
cheeks
grow
hotter
.
Oh
please
do
n't
let
me
blush
now
!
she
prayed
.
"
No
,
I
'm
late
.
I
've
been
playing
tennis
.
"
"
That
explains
it
.
"
He
shifted
the
racket
between
his
knees
.
"
Do
you
play
a
lot
?
"
"
When
I
can
.
"
"
Are
you
good
?
"
"
Not
bad
,
considering
the
shaky
start
I
had
.
When
I
was
a
first
year
I
was
put
in
as
ballboy
and
I
did
n't
know
the
rules
.
I
kept
throwing
the
ball
back
to
the
wrong
player
.
Every
time
I
thought
I
'd
got
the
hang
of
it
the
service
changed
.
And
then
I
was
sent
to
retrieve
the
balls
from
the
headmaster
's
garden
.
I
was
terrified
of
knocking
on
the
door
of
the
house
to
ask
permission
but
I
was
even
more
terrified
of
going
back
and
making
a
fool
of
myself
because
of
my
ignorance
on
court
so
I
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
skulking
behind
the
sweet
peas
.
"
He
laughed
.
He
had
a
nice
laugh
,
she
thought
.
They
chattered
until
Sally
realised
the
bus
was
pulling
up
at
her
stop
.
She
scrambled
to
her
feet
.
"
I
get
off
here
.
"
He
handed
her
her
racket
.
"
When
can
I
see
you
again
?
"
"
Oh
!
"
She
knew
her
cheeks
were
flaming
now
.
"
I
do
n't
know
-
"
"
Are
you
getting
off
or
not
?
"
the
conductor
yelled
,
his
finger
on
the
bell
.
"
Can
you
get
to
Bath
?
I
'll
see
you
on
Saturday
-
half
past
seven
at
the
bus
stop
,
"
the
boy
said
.
"
Yes
,
all
right
-
"
She
staggered
down
the
gangway
,
shell-shocked
,
and
walked
home
feeling
as
if
she
was
floating
on
air
but
as
Saturday
approached
the
nervousness
began
.
she
could
get
a
bus
to
Bath
,
but
how
would
she
get
home
again
?
Where
would
he
take
her
?
What
should
she
wear
?
She
did
n't
even
know
his
name
but
she
did
know
that
this
time
she
was
IN
LOVE
!
The
question
of
what
to
wear
was
easily
settled
.
Louise
had
gone
back
to
Nîmes
now
but
she
had
left
Sally
the
white
dress
as
a
parting
gift
and
even
without
the
waspie-waisted
basque
it
was
by
far
the
nicest
thing
Sally
owned
.
She
wore
it
with
a
pair
of
new
white
sandals
and
a
lacy
white
cardigan
her
mother
had
knitted
for
her
.
At
a
quarter
past
seven
she
got
off
the
bus
in
Bath
worrying
that
he
might
stand
her
up
.
But
he
was
there
waiting
and
looked
more
handsome
than
ever
in
a
grey
suit
with
a
white
shirt
.
"
Would
you
like
to
go
to
the
dance
at
the
Regency
?
"
lie
asked
.
"
Oh
yes
-
only
I
've
got
to
catch
the
last
bus
home
and
it
leaves
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
-
"
"
Do
n't
worry
,
I
'll
have
you
on
it
,
"
he
promised
.
The
Regency
had
once
been
a
Palace
of
Varieties
.
There
was
a
bar
selling
alcoholic
drinks
and
two
milk
bars
,
one
at
floor
level
,
one
in
what
had
once
been
the
balcony
,
and
a
huge
multi-faceted
glass
ball
which
hung
over
the
dance
floor
.
A
narrow
gallery
ran
around
the
other
three
sides
of
the
hall
from
which
it
was
possible
to
watch
the
dancers
or
enjoy
the
band
-
a
real
band
,
at
least
a
dozen
musicians
,
all
in
uniform
blazers
and
bow
ties
.
Sometimes
the
big
name
bands
came
to
the
Regency
-
Kenny
Ball
and
Ted
Heath
,
Acker
Bilk
and
The
Temperance
Seven
,
but
tonight
it
was
the
resident
band
.
The
whole
place
seemed
to
be
throbbing
with
the
music
they
made
.
Sally
left
her
bag
in
the
cloakroom
and
met
Edward
in
the
balcony
milk
bar
where
he
had
a
strawberry
milk
shake
waiting
for
her
.
She
sipped
it
through
a
straw
looking
around
with
interest
.
The
place
had
n't
filled
up
yet
but
she
noticed
that
the
boys
were
congregating
at
the
end
of
the
hall
beneath
the
balcony
and
on
the
left
hand
side
while
the
girls
were
spread
between
the
tables
and
chairs
on
the
opposite
wall
,
chatting
and
giggling
and
trying
to
pretend
they
were
not
waiting
to
be
asked
to
dance
.
A
few
girls
were
dancing
together
as
they
did
at
the
youth
club
hops
and
the
dancing
was
of
the
proper
"
ballroom
variety
"
-
waltzes
,
quicksteps
and
foxtrots
.
When
Edward
suggested
they
dance
Sally
was
grateful
for
the
lessons
she
had
endured
in
the
school
gymnasium
with
Miss
Smart
the
games
teacher
yelling
"
slow
,
slow
,
quick
quick
,
slow
"
in
time
to
the
music
.
Edward
danced
well
,
guiding
her
with
confidence
,
and
soon
he
was
holding
her
very
close
.
Unlike
Pete
he
smelled
nice
-
Sally
thought
it
was
Old
Spice
-
and
when
he
pressed
his
hips
against
hers
she
was
excited
by
the
sensations
it
aroused
,
not
revolted
as
she
had
been
with
the
Teddy
Boy
at
the
youth
club
dance
.
Over
his
shoulder
she
glanced
at
the
clock
over
the
door
-
the
hands
seemed
to
be
moving
very
fast
and
she
was
reluctant
to
say
it
was
time
she
was
going
.
At
last
she
could
postpone
it
no
longer
-
she
had
just
ten
minutes
to
get
to
her
bus
!
She
collected
her
bag
and
hand
in
hand
they
ran
all
the
way
-
just
in
time
to
see
the
bus
disappearing
along
the
road
.
"
Whatever
will
I
do
?
Mum
will
kill
me
!
"
Sally
wailed
.
"
Do
n't
worry
,
I
'll
get
you
a
taxi
,
"
he
promised
.
He
'd
never
ask
her
out
again
now
,
Sally
thought
gloomily
.
But
as
they
walked
to
the
taxi
rank
he
said
:
"
Could
you
get
into
Bath
in
the
week
?
We
could
go
to
the
pictures
,
"
and
she
agreed
happily
.
Edward
paid
the
taxi
driver
in
advance
and
all
the
way
home
she
sat
in
a
happy
daze
.
The
curtains
twitched
as
the
taxi
pulled
up
outside
her
house
and
her
mother
was
in
the
doorway
.
"
What
on
earth
are
you
doing
coming
home
in
a
taxi
?
"
"
Edward
got
it
for
me
.
"
"
Edward
is
it
?
Well
all
I
can
say
is
he
must
have
money
to
burn
!
"
"
He
just
wanted
to
make
sure
I
got
home
safely
,
"
Sally
said
smugly
.
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
she
had
outdone
Paula
,
who
had
never
,
ever
,
arrived
home
in
a
taxi
!
That
summer
was
the
most
exciting
Sally
had
ever
known
.
Twice
weekly
she
went
to
Bath
to
meet
Edward
,
though
ever
afterwards
he
made
sure
she
was
on
the
last
bus
home
.
Sometimes
they
went
to
the
cinema
,
sometimes
they
sat
in
coffee
bars
holding
hands
across
the
table
,
sometimes
they
walked
in
the
park
,
and
on
Saturdays
they
almost
always
went
to
the
dance
.
Sally
lived
in
a
happy
whirl
marred
only
by
worrying
about
how
far
she
should
go
.
After
the
first
few
dates
when
he
had
kissed
and
cuddled
her
and
only
touched
her
breasts
through
her
blouse
,
he
had
started
slipping
his
hand
inside
.
Although
she
felt
a
little
guilty
about
letting
him
do
it
Sally
found
she
quite
liked
the
feel
of
his
fingers
stroking
her
flesh
and
teasing
her
nipples
but
when
he
tried
to
put
his
hand
up
her
skirt
beneath
her
scratchy
petticoats
she
tried
to
stop
him
.
"
Do
n't
,
please
,
"
she
begged
,
grabbing
his
hand
.
"
Why
?
"
he
asked
,
creeping
up
further
.
"
Because
.
"
But
he
refused
to
take
no
for
an
answer
and
after
a
few
unseemly
tussles
Sally
decided
it
was
easier
to
give
in
and
let
him
explore
inside
the
leg
of
her
panties
.
At
first
it
was
n't
too
bad
but
soon
his
finger
was
prodding
right
inside
her
and
that
hurt
,
a
sharp
,
squeaky
sort
of
pain
like
someone
drawing
a
fingernail
across
a
sheet
of
plastic
.
As
he
prodded
around
all
the
dreamy
romantic
feelings
she
experienced
when
he
kissed
her
disappeared
and
all
she
could
think
of
was
when
would
he
stop
,
and
could
n't
he
please
just
hold
her
again
,
very
close
,
with
the
firm
bulge
of
his
body
against
her
,
far
more
erotic
through
several
layers
of
clothes
than
his
scratching
,
poking
finger
.
The
next
thing
was
that
he
wanted
her
to
hold
the
bulge
.
The
first
time
was
in
the
cinema
.
In
the
darkness
,
under
cover
of
which
they
had
been
kissing
cuddling
so
much
(
with
his
hand
inside
her
blouse
)
that
she
had
not
the
first
idea
what
the
film
was
about
,
he
took
her
hand
and
guided
it
down
to
his
lap
.
Sally
almost
jumped
as
she
encountered
the
rigid
roll
.
She
took
her
hand
away
,
but
Edward
only
replaced
it
.
What
was
she
supposed
to
do
?
Taking
a
deep
breath
she
gripped
the
roll
and
held
onto
it
,
not
moving
.
She
simply
could
n't
bring
herself
to
stroke
or
rub
it
.
But
Edward
seemed
satisfied
.
He
kissed
her
fervently
and
they
stayed
that
way
until
the
lights
went
up
and
the
usherettes
began
moving
down
the
aisles
with
their
trays
of
icecream
.
Sally
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
,
squinting
down
to
make
sure
her
blouse
was
done
up
properly
and
embarrassed
to
meet
Edward
's
eyes
.
Presumably
everybody
else
in
the
world
did
it
she
thought
.
But
remembering
still
made
her
blush
all
over
.
One
thing
she
was
quite
certain
of
-
she
was
in
love
with
Edward
and
that
meant
she
would
have
to
continue
to
let
him
-
or
he
would
find
someone
else
who
would
.
Boys
were
like
that
-
the
girls
at
school
said
so
.
The
trouble
was
that
if
you
permitted
intimacy
you
would
be
thought
of
as
"
cheap
"
and
perhaps
be
talked
about
as
the
girls
at
the
dance
had
talked
about
Paula
,
only
by
the
boys
,
which
was
worse
,
but
if
you
did
n't
no
boy
would
be
prepared
to
bother
with
you
for
long
.
The
dilemma
threatened
to
spoil
Sally
's
happiness
but
one
thing
she
was
certain
of
-
whatever
it
took
she
would
do
it
because
she
could
n't
bear
to
lose
him
.
"
Sally
,
I
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
,
"
Paula
said
.
Her
voice
had
that
familiar
note
that
was
halfway
between
wheedling
and
autocracy
and
Sally
's
heart
sank
.
When
Paula
used
that
tone
it
usually
meant
trouble
.
"
What
?
"
she
asked
,
rather
aggressively
.
"
Sally
!
"
Paula
gave
her
a
hurt
glare
.
"
I
do
n't
very
often
ask
you
to
do
anything
for
me
-
and
I
did
lend
you
my
ear-rings
when
you
went
out
with
that
Edward
last
week
.
"
"
All
right
-
what
is
it
you
want
?
"
"
Help
me
get
out
of
going
to
Gran
's
on
Sunday
.
"
Once
a
fortnight
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
the
girls
went
to
tea
with
Gran
Bristow
in
the
little
house
that
had
once
been
their
home
.
Sally
quite
enjoyed
the
visits
but
Paula
had
no
patience
for
making
conversation
with
Gran
,
who
tended
to
have
very
old-fashioned
,
dyed-in-the-wool
ideas
and
was
easily
shocked
,
and
she
hated
having
to
eat
her
way
through
the
ham
salad
and
bread
and
butter
,
Victoria
sponge
and
tinned
fruit
and
cream
which
Gran
not
only
laid
on
but
also
piled
high
on
her
plate
because
she
thought
Paula
much
too
thin
.
"
Oh
Paula
!
"
Sally
scolded
.
"
You
know
how
Gran
looks
forward
to
seeing
us
.
And
Mum
and
Dad
are
going
off
on
holiday
on
Saturday
,
so
they
wo
n't
be
popping
in
to
visit
for
a
couple
of
weeks
.
"
"
Exactly
.
That
's
why
you
can
tell
Gran
a
white
lie
and
she
wo
n't
know
any
different
.
"
"
What
sort
of
a
white
lie
?
"
Paula
's
face
took
on
a
vixenish
wickedness
.
"
I
did
think
you
could
say
I
had
a
cold
because
you
know
how
frightened
Gran
is
of
catching
colds
.
But
it
's
a
bit
boring
and
it
is
the
middle
of
summer
.
So
tell
her
I
broke
the
heel
on
my
shoe
as
we
were
walking
over
.
"
"
Wo
n't
she
expect
you
to
come
over
once
you
've
been
home
and
changed
your
shoes
?
"
Sally
asked
reasonably
.
"
You
can
say
I
twisted
my
ankle
when
the
heel
broke
,
"
Paula
improvised
.
"
But
why
do
n't
you
want
to
go
to
Gran
's
?
"
Sally
asked
.
"
It
's
a
drag
.
All
my
friends
will
be
at
the
coffee
bar
.
"
"
I
'm
not
telling
lies
for
you
just
because
you
want
to
go
to
the
coffee
bar
,
"
Sally
objected
.
"
In
fact
I
do
n't
like
telling
lies
for
you
full
stop
.
If
you
do
n't
want
to
go
you
'll
just
have
to
say
so
.
"
"
Well
,
if
you
're
going
to
be
like
that
-
"
Paula
said
slyly
,
"
I
might
just
tell
Mum
what
you
and
Edward
get
up
to
in
the
pictures
.
"
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
Sally
demanded
,
but
a
scarlet
flush
was
creeping
up
her
neck
at
an
alarming
rate
and
flooding
her
cheeks
.
Paula
smiled
,
enjoying
her
sister
's
discomfort
-
and
the
feeling
of
power
it
gave
her
.
"
as
if
you
did
n't
know
!
But
if
you
really
want
me
to
go
into
details
Valerie
Mitchell
was
sitting
not
far
from
you
last
week
.
And
she
was
pretty
shocked
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
Valerie
Mitchell
lived
in
the
next
road
and
travelled
to
work
on
the
same
bus
as
Paula
.
What
she
had
actually
said
was
:
"
Your
little
sister
has
grown
up
,
has
n't
she
?
Well
,
enough
to
have
a
good
time
in
the
back
row
at
the
pictures
anyway
,
"
and
she
had
certainly
not
elaborated
.
But
Sally
was
not
to
know
that
and
she
was
mortified
.
Oh
God
,
if
Valerie
had
been
shocked
perhaps
she
was
going
too
far
!
And
if
Paula
should
tell
her
mother
she
thought
she
would
die
of
shame
!
"
I
should
n't
think
Mum
would
let
you
go
out
with
Edward
again
if
she
knew
what
you
get
up
to
,
"
Paula
said
carelessly
.
"
But
of
course
if
you
tell
Gran
about
my
broken
shoe
on
Sunday
there
really
wo
n't
be
any
need
for
her
to
know
.
"
"
Sometimes
I
hate
you
,
Paula
,
"
Sally
said
.
"
Sometimes
I
wish
you
were
n't
my
sister
.
You
really
are
n't
very
nice
at
all
.
"
Paula
shrugged
,
looking
very
smug
.
"
Who
cares
about
being
nice
?
"
she
asked
.
"
Getting
what
you
want
is
much
more
important
.
And
I
am
going
to
get
what
I
want
,
are
n't
I
?
"
Sally
nodded
.
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
in
a
small
,
ashamed
voice
.
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
you
are
.
You
always
do
.
"
In
spite
of
all
the
worrying
about
it
the
next
stage
with
Edward
still
took
Sally
by
surprise
when
it
actually
happened
.
They
were
in
a
dark
corner
behind
the
bandstand
in
the
park
and
had
quickly
gone
through
all
the
other
stages
,
including
the
one
Sally
liked
best
,
kissing
and
pressing
the
lower
half
of
their
bodies
close
together
as
if
they
were
dancing
.
Tonight
her
skirt
was
rucked
up
almost
to
her
waist
and
she
found
this
was
even
better
than
usual
because
the
bulge
fitted
neatly
between
her
thighs
and
touched
even
deeper
chords
of
excitement
.
So
ecstatic
was
she
that
she
did
not
notice
Edward
fumbling
with
his
clothes
until
she
became
aware
of
moist
clingy
flesh
,
thrusting
and
rubbing
.
Her
heart
came
into
her
mouth
with
a
great
choking
leap
.
"
Edward
-
stop
it
!
"
she
gasped
.
He
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
.
He
was
rocking
and
moaning
,
his
breathing
heavy
and
catchy
.
"
Edward
!
"
she
protested
,
wriggling
.
She
could
feel
the
tip
probing
up
the
leg
of
her
panties
and
she
knew
it
should
not
be
there
.
This
was
not
just
embarrassing
,
it
was
downright
dangerous
.
She
put
her
hand
down
to
push
him
away
and
he
grabbed
it
,
squeezing
it
around
the
erect
penis
and
forcing
her
to
rub
it
up
and
down
.
As
she
felt
the
muscular
ridges
pulsing
and
throbbing
she
almost
sobbed
aloud
from
a
mixture
of
fear
,
curiosity
and
excitement
,
but
at
least
the
thing
was
no
longer
between
her
legs
.
Then
she
felt
it
jerk
violently
and
Edward
shuddered
and
bit
her
neck
as
warm
sticky
fluid
spurted
into
her
hand
.
She
stood
quite
still
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
after
a
moment
he
pulled
away
,
reached
into
his
pocket
for
a
handkerchief
and
wiped
himself
,
his
hand
and
hers
.
Then
he
threw
his
handkerchief
into
a
bush
.
"
Ca
n't
take
that
home
,
"
he
said
with
a
shaky
laugh
.
Sally
felt
shaky
too
.
She
wriggled
her
skirt
down
over
her
thighs
and
when
she
risked
a
look
she
was
relieved
to
discover
Edward
had
done
his
trousers
up
again
.
Suddenly
she
longed
to
have
him
kiss
her
again
and
hold
her
close
.
That
would
somehow
make
everything
all
right
.
But
he
no
longer
seemed
interested
.
"
It
's
time
for
your
bus
,
"
he
said
.
Inexplicably
Sally
felt
like
crying
.
He
held
her
hand
as
they
walked
through
the
streets
but
Sally
could
not
feel
any
of
the
warmth
she
so
desperately
needed
.
It
was
a
clear
night
and
there
was
an
enormous
moon
which
was
reflected
in
the
dark
waters
of
the
river
Avon
-
it
should
be
so
romantic
,
Sally
thought
,
but
somehow
it
was
n't
.
She
felt
sadder
than
ever
.
"
I
'll
see
you
on
Saturday
,
same
time
,
same
place
,
"
Edward
said
giving
her
a
quick
peck
and
pushing
her
up
the
steps
of
the
bus
.
On
the
way
home
Sally
could
feel
people
looking
at
her
and
wondered
why
.
It
was
only
when
she
got
home
and
looked
in
the
hall
mirror
that
she
saw
the
enormous
dark
red
love
bite
on
her
neck
.
Quickly
she
covered
the
bruise
with
her
collar
.
Heaven
knew
how
she
would
conceal
it
at
school
tomorrow
,
especially
as
she
had
games
.
Perhaps
face
powder
or
foundation
?
Sally
felt
even
more
like
crying
.
She
loved
Edward
.
But
why
did
it
all
have
to
be
so
messy
and
complicated
?
Why
did
it
have
to
make
her
feel
so
horrid
and
ashamed
?
She
was
still
looking
in
the
mirror
making
sure
there
were
no
other
tell-tale
signs
of
the
evening
's
activities
when
the
living-room
door
was
thrown
open
and
her
mother
,
looking
very
stern
,
appeared
.
"
Sally
-
come
in
here
this
minute
!
"
she
ordered
.
Sally
quaked
inwardly
.
Oh
God
,
she
must
have
been
found
out
!
But
who
could
have
seen
her
in
the
park
and
reported
back
this
quickly
?
Nervously
smoothing
her
skirt
and
praying
there
were
no
stains
she
had
missed
,
she
went
along
the
hall
and
into
the
living
room
.
She
knew
at
once
it
was
serious
because
her
father
was
still
up
.
Having
to
get
up
very
early
in
the
mornings
he
tended
to
be
in
bed
by
the
time
she
arrived
home
on
the
last
bus
from
Bath
.
But
here
he
was
,
still
sitting
in
his
chair
(
and
looking
as
though
he
wished
he
were
n't
)
whilst
her
mother
stood
on
the
hearth-rug
,
arms
folded
and
wearing
a
furious
expression
.
Sally
began
to
tremble
in
earnest
.
"
Well
,
madam
!
"
her
mother
demanded
.
"
What
I
would
like
to
know
is
why
you
saw
fit
to
tell
barefaced
lies
to
your
grandmother
while
your
Dad
and
I
were
on
holiday
.
"
Sally
was
so
surprised
she
could
only
stare
.
"
And
what
a
stupid
lie
too
!
"
Grace
went
on
furiously
.
"
Saying
she
'd
broken
the
heel
on
her
shoe
!
The
minute
your
gran
told
me
about
it
I
knew
it
was
n't
true
-
and
so
did
she
,
or
suspected
as
much
,
anyway
.
Why
did
you
do
it
,
Sally
?
You
know
I
wo
n't
have
you
telling
lies
.
"
"
I
-
well
,
Paula
told
me
to
,
"
Sally
said
miserably
.
"
Oh
yes
,
made
up
a
story
like
that
that
she
'd
have
known
her
gran
would
see
through
-
I
can
believe
that
.
"
"
She
did
.
She
told
me
to
say
it
.
"
"
I
've
already
talked
to
Paula
about
this
,
"
Grace
said
sternly
.
"
She
tells
me
she
was
n't
feeling
well
.
That
was
what
you
were
supposed
to
tell
your
gran
.
"
"
No
.
"
"
Do
n't
lie
again
,
Sally
.
I
suppose
you
thought
you
'd
paint
Paula
in
a
bad
light
and
make
it
seem
as
though
she
could
n't
be
bothered
to
go
.
Well
,
I
'm
ashamed
of
you
,
I
am
really
.
No
!
"
she
wagged
a
finger
to
silence
Sally
's
protest
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
any
more
.
But
I
promise
you
this
,
my
girl
,
if
you
tell
lies
again
,
particularly
spiteful
ones
,
then
I
shall
find
some
way
of
punishing
you
that
you
wo
n't
forget
in
a
hurry
.
Go
on
to
bed
now
.
"
Sally
went
,
relieved
at
not
having
had
her
love
bite
spotted
but
filled
with
indignation
at
having
been
blamed
so
unjustly
for
the
Gran
Bristow
episode
.
Paula
was
already
in
bed
,
reading
a
paper
novelette
.
"
I
've
just
caught
it
hot
and
holy
for
telling
Gran
lies
,
"
Sally
yelled
at
her
.
"
You
've
got
to
tell
Mum
I
only
said
what
you
told
me
to
.
"
Paula
did
not
even
look
up
from
her
book
.
"
No
.
Why
should
I
?
"
"
Because
it
's
not
fair
!
They
think
I
did
it
to
get
you
into
trouble
or
something
.
You
've
got
to
tell
them
the
truth
!
"
"
I
'm
not
saying
anything
.
I
'd
only
end
up
in
the
doghouse
myself
would
n't
I
?
Just
leave
it
,
Sal
.
"
"
But
why
should
I
get
the
blame
?
"
Sally
cried
.
"
Because
you
're
the
twit
.
"
"
And
you
're
a
horrible
,
selfish
cow
and
I
hate
you
!
Oh
,
how
I
hate
you
!
"
There
was
a
loud
bang
on
the
door
and
Grace
's
angry
voice
called
:
"
And
you
can
stop
that
quarrelling
,
the
pair
of
you
.
You
're
like
a
pair
of
tom
cats
!
"
"
I
hate
you
!
I
hate
you
!
"
Sally
hissed
under
her
breath
.
"
Keep
quiet
,
Sally
,
you
heard
what
Mum
said
.
"
"
And
I
'll
never
forgive
you
.
Never
!
"
But
even
as
she
seethed
she
knew
it
was
not
true
.
By
this
time
tomorrow
the
whole
thing
would
be
forgotten
and
she
would
have
forgiven
Paula
.
Paula
could
not
help
herself
.
It
was
just
the
way
she
was
.
Others
might
say
they
hated
her
and
mean
it
.
Sally
never
would
.
Whatever
Paula
did
,
however
mean
and
underhand
,
however
selfish
,
in
the
end
Sally
would
find
an
excuse
for
her
.
Was
n't
that
what
sisters
were
for
?
Ever
since
she
had
left
school
Paula
had
worked
in
one
of
the
big
department
stores
in
Bristol
and
she
loved
it
,
although
the
lengthy
journey
made
for
very
long
days
and
the
bus
fares
ate
holes
in
her
meagre
salary
.
But
to
Paula
Ladies
'
Fashions
was
a
veritable
Aladdin
's
cave
of
delights
.
She
loved
the
rails
of
beautiful
clothes
-
the
tailored
suits
and
the
beaded
evening
dresses
,
the
taffeta
and
lace
and
wool
baratheas
and
most
of
all
the
furs
,
and
when
she
could
she
would
slip
into
one
of
the
changing
rooms
and
try
things
on
.
Because
she
was
so
tall
and
slim
all
the
clothes
looked
marvellous
on
her
and
the
other
girls
would
groan
their
envy
.
It
simply
was
not
fair
that
anyone
could
look
so
good
in
absolutely
everything
!
Paula
disagreed
.
The
greatest
unfairness
,
she
thought
,
was
that
the
women
who
could
afford
to
buy
the
beautiful
clothes
simply
did
not
do
them
justice
,
while
she
,
who
showed
them
off
so
well
,
had
to
save
for
weeks
,
even
given
her
staff
discount
,
for
the
most
modestly
priced
item
.
All
too
often
she
had
to
watch
the
garment
she
had
set
her
heart
on
disappear
out
of
the
store
inside
one
of
the
giant
shiny
carrier
bags
with
rope
handles
.
One
day
,
she
promised
herself
,
she
would
be
rich
enough
to
buy
whatever
she
wanted
-
not
only
clothes
but
jewellery
and
perfume
,
real
leather
shoes
and
the
very
best
cosmetics
-
no
more
Miners
and
Outdoor
Girl
from
Woolworths
!
Jenkinsons
,
the
department
store
,
occupied
a
grand
old
building
in
the
heart
of
Bristol
and
a
good
third
of
the
top
floor
was
taken
up
by
a
restaurant
-
The
Palm
Court
.
Genteel
and
restful
with
lace
cloths
on
the
little
tables
,
parlour
palms
in
pots
around
what
might
almost
have
been
a
dais
for
a
three-piece
orchestra
,
and
table
service
by
waitresses
in
neat
black
dresses
and
white
lace
caps
and
aprons
,
the
Palm
Court
was
invariably
at
its
busiest
with
morning
coffees
and
afternoon
teas
when
shoppers
were
tempted
with
an
array
of
dainty
cakes
and
pastries
and
hot
toasted
teacakes
in
silver
dishes
complete
with
lids
.
The
clientele
made
a
perfect
captive
audience
and
in
the
early
autumn
of
Paula
's
second
year
at
the
store
the
management
decided
to
bring
in
models
to
show
the
new
season
's
fashions
at
the
times
when
the
restaurant
was
most
likely
to
be
full
of
ladies
who
had
accounts
with
Jenkinsons
and
cheque
books
in
their
capacious
handbags
.
A
local
model
agency
provided
the
girls
for
the
twice-weekly
shows
and
Paula
was
detailed
to
help
"
backstage
"
.
When
the
three
girls
arrived
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
in
spite
of
their
sophistication
they
were
not
much
older
than
she
was
and
as
she
watched
them
glide
out
in
the
first
selection
of
fashions
she
felt
a
small
prickle
of
excitement
.
If
they
could
do
it
-
why
should
n't
she
?
She
was
as
tall
as
they
were
,
she
wore
the
clothes
just
as
well
and
she
was
just
as
pretty
,
if
not
prettier
.
Whilst
dressing
the
models
she
tried
to
chat
to
them
and
ask
how
they
had
come
by
their
jobs
but
they
were
not
very
forthcoming
.
It
was
as
if
they
considered
themselves
above
socialising
with
a
mere
shop
assistant
.
Paula
was
annoyed
but
not
subdued
.
Her
own
self-confidence
made
her
impervious
to
the
intended
snubs
.
One
morning
as
she
was
rushing
back
to
the
changing
rooms
one
of
the
models
slipped
and
twisted
her
ankle
.
As
she
hobbled
and
hopped
in
agony
Mrs
Freer
,
the
Fashion
Buyer
,
fumed
.
"
We
have
n't
shown
the
cornflower
blue
yet
and
I
particularly
wanted
it
to
have
an
airing
.
At
the
price
it
is
,
the
sooner
I
can
find
a
buyer
for
it
the
happier
I
'll
be
.
"
Paula
,
who
was
zipping
one
of
the
other
models
into
a
cocktail
dress
,
felt
her
skin
begin
to
prick
with
excitement
.
"
Let
me
wear
it
,
Mrs
Freer
!
"
she
suggested
.
"
It
fits
me
.
And
I
could
model
,
I
know
I
could
!
"
The
other
girls
looked
at
her
with
dislike
but
Paula
ignored
them
.
"
Very
well
,
"
Mrs
Freer
said
after
a
moment
's
consideration
.
"
Try
it
on
.
Hmm
.
It
does
look
good
on
you
.
But
you
'll
need
a
little
more
eye
shadow
-
blue
to
bring
out
the
colour
of
the
suit
.
And
will
the
hat
sit
right
on
your
hair
?
"
On
the
shop
floor
Paula
wore
her
hair
in
a
French
pleat
.
Now
she
let
it
down
and
tied
it
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
with
a
scarf
.
Above
it
,
the
hat
sat
perfectly
.
A
touch
more
eyeshadow
and
mascara
and
she
twirled
for
Mrs
Freer
.
"
Will
I
do
?
"
"
Yes
.
Now
take
your
time
,
wo
n't
you
?
Do
n't
rush
.
Give
the
customers
plenty
of
opportunity
to
see
you
from
all
angles
and
let
them
feel
the
cloth
if
they
want
to
.
And
do
n't
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
bump
into
a
table
or
one
of
the
waitresses
-
"
"
I
know
,
"
Paula
said
impatiently
.
Had
n't
she
been
watching
the
models
for
weeks
and
dying
for
a
chance
to
imitate
them
?
As
she
walked
onto
the
floor
her
heart
was
beating
fast
with
excitement
but
her
face
was
a
smiling
serene
mask
.
She
moved
with
natural
grace
,
gliding
between
the
tables
,
approaching
customers
who
showed
an
interest
to
give
them
an
extra
twirl
,
unbuttoning
the
little
figure-hugging
jacket
and
posing
with
her
hand
on
her
waist
,
rucking
up
the
jacket
slightly
to
display
the
blouse
underneath
as
she
had
seen
the
professional
models
do
.
She
was
enjoying
herself
so
much
that
she
stayed
on
the
floor
longer
than
she
should
have
done
and
it
was
only
when
she
saw
Mrs
Freer
making
furious
faces
at
her
from
the
doorway
that
she
turned
and
glided
back
.
She
felt
as
if
she
were
floating
on
air
.
"
Over
exposure
wo
n't
help
one
bit
!
"
Mrs
Freer
hissed
as
she
passed
her
and
in
the
dressing
room
the
other
models
pointedly
turned
their
backs
on
her
,
annoyed
that
an
untrained
shop
girl
should
have
been
allowed
to
trespass
in
their
territory
.
But
to
Paula
's
triumphant
delight
the
suit
was
snapped
up
the
moment
it
went
back
onto
its
hanger
-
a
solicitor
's
wife
who
had
stopped
for
a
coffee
had
fallen
in
love
with
it
,
even
if
the
skirt
did
have
to
be
taken
up
four
full
inches
to
make
it
fit
her
less-than-willow
tall
frame
.
"
You
did
quite
well
,
"
Mrs
Freer
admitted
grudgingly
,
then
spoiled
it
by
adding
:
"
Do
n't
let
it
go
to
your
head
.
"
The
remark
was
lost
on
Paula
.
She
knew
now
without
a
moment
's
doubt
exactly
what
she
was
going
to
do
.
On
her
very
next
day
off
Paula
made
herself
up
carefully
,
put
on
her
smartest
suit
-
a
cheap
version
of
the
one
she
had
shown
in
the
restaurant
-
and
caught
a
bus
to
Bristol
.
The
model
agency
office
was
in
a
tall
old
house
in
Clifton
and
Paula
splashed
out
some
of
her
savings
on
a
taxi
so
that
she
could
at
least
arrive
in
style
.
Her
stomach
was
turning
nervous
somersaults
as
she
rang
the
bell
but
she
was
determined
no
one
should
realise
it
.
Arlene
Frampton-Cox
,
who
ran
the
agency
,
had
once
been
a
model
herself
-
and
it
showed
.
She
was
tall
and
beautifully
groomed
with
iron-grey
hair
,
a
smooth
,
high-cheekboned
face
and
a
most
intimidating
manner
.
When
Paula
was
shown
into
her
office
Arlene
looked
up
from
a
sheaf
of
photographs
which
were
spread
on
her
desk
with
just
a
hint
of
impatience
.
"
Yes
?
"
"
I
want
to
be
a
model
,
"
Paula
said
directly
.
"
Could
you
take
me
onto
your
books
?
"
Arlene
looked
her
up
and
down
with
a
practised
eye
.
Although
she
gave
no
hint
of
it
,
she
liked
what
she
saw
.
"
What
training
have
you
had
?
"
she
enquired
.
"
I
have
n't
,
"
Paula
admitted
.
"
But
I
did
stand
in
for
one
of
your
girls
at
Jenkinsons
last
week
-
and
I
sold
the
suit
I
showed
.
"
Arlene
's
scarlet
lips
tightened
a
shade
.
She
did
not
approve
of
amateurs
,
especially
amateurs
who
thought
they
could
step
into
the
shoes
of
professional
models
.
"
I
'm
sorry
but
I
'm
afraid
there
is
no
way
I
could
take
an
untrained
girl
onto
my
books
.
Though
it
may
look
easy
there
is
a
right
way
to
walk
,
to
sit
,
to
turn
,
to
remove
a
coat
.
"
Paula
's
heart
sank
.
She
had
thought
she
knew
how
to
do
these
things
but
this
imposing
woman
was
making
her
feel
very
gauche
,
very
uncomfortable
.
Arlene
's
mouth
twitched
slightly
but
Paula
did
not
notice
it
.
"
Of
course
,
if
you
wish
to
learn
I
do
run
classes
in
the
art
of
modelling
,
"
she
continued
smoothly
.
"
Twelve
lessons
is
normal
,
though
if
a
girl
is
particularly
adept
eight
might
be
sufficient
.
I
use
a
room
at
the
Grand
Hotel
twice
weekly
,
on
a
Tuesday
and
Thursday
evening
and
do
all
the
teaching
myself
.
That
way
I
can
be
certain
my
pupils
are
properly
trained
.
"
"
And
if
I
took
the
classes
then
you
would
take
me
onto
your
books
?
"
Paula
asked
.
"
If
you
do
well
enough
I
would
consider
it
.
"
The
steely-grey
eyes
ran
over
Paula
again
.
"
How
tall
are
you
?
"
"
Five
nine
and
a
half
.
"
"
And
what
are
your
measurements
?
"
"
33
-
21
-
32
.
"
"
Too
big
in
the
bust
,
"
Arlene
said
shortly
.
"
But
I
dare
say
we
could
get
around
that
.
A
good
strong
binder
instead
of
a
brassiere
-
it
's
been
done
before
.
"
Paula
shuddered
.
She
had
spent
most
of
her
life
wishing
she
had
"
more
up
top
"
.
To
be
told
she
would
have
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the
little
she
had
was
not
what
she
had
expected
-
or
wanted
to
hear
.
But
she
was
too
determined
to
be
put
off
now
.
"
When
can
I
start
?
"
she
asked
.
For
the
first
time
during
the
interview
Arlene
smiled
faintly
.
"
Come
along
next
Tuesday
and
I
'll
see
you
are
enrolled
,
"
she
said
.
"
Modelling
?
"
Grace
repeated
in
horror
when
Paula
told
her
of
her
plans
.
"
I
've
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
!
Whatever
put
an
idea
like
that
in
your
head
?
"
"
Why
should
n't
I
?
"
Paula
argued
.
"
I
'm
the
right
shape
-
Mrs
Frampton-Cox
said
so
.
And
I
want
to
do
it
!
It
's
a
wonderful
job
!
"
"
You
have
a
good
job
.
"
"
No
I
have
n't
.
I
've
got
a
crummy
ordinary
dogsbody
job
.
I
want
to
do
something
special
.
"
"
But
modelling
!
Whatever
will
people
say
?
I
've
always
been
so
proud
of
you
,
Paula
.
I
'd
never
be
able
to
hold
up
my
head
again
!
"
"
Oh
really
!
"
Paula
retorted
.
"
I
shall
be
modelling
clothes
,
not
doing
a
strip-tease
.
"
"
One
thing
leads
to
another
,
"
Grace
said
darkly
.
"
It
's
the
life
,
Paula
.
It
's
not
right
for
a
young
girl
.
Is
it
,
Reg
?
"
she
appealed
to
Paula
's
father
,
who
was
reading
the
Daily
Mirror
and
enjoying
a
Woodbine
after
his
well-earned
tea
.
"
I
do
n't
suppose
she
'll
come
to
much
harm
,
Grace
,
"
he
replied
mildly
.
Grace
sighed
with
exasperation
.
Could
n't
Reg
ever
take
anything
seriously
?
Could
n't
he
see
,
as
she
could
,
the
moral
dangers
of
getting
into
that
sort
of
fickle
world
?
"
I
do
n't
care
what
you
say
,
I
'm
going
to
do
it
,
"
Paula
said
and
Grace
shook
her
head
resignedly
.
Paula
might
look
as
if
butter
would
n't
melt
in
her
mouth
but
when
her
mind
was
made
up
to
something
it
took
a
stronger
woman
than
Grace
to
talk
her
out
of
it
.
It
had
always
been
the
same
,
ever
since
she
was
a
little
girl
.
"
Well
I
hope
you
'll
look
out
for
yourself
and
remember
how
we
've
brought
you
up
"
,
Grace
warned
.
Paula
smiled
,
all
sunshine
now
she
had
her
own
way
,
and
treated
her
mother
to
a
hug
that
was
enthusiastic
yet
somehow
oddly
impersonal
.
"
I
will
.
And
when
I
'm
famous
you
'll
be
proud
of
me
,
"
she
promised
.
After
only
eight
lessons
Arlene
asked
Paula
to
wait
at
the
end
of
class
.
"
If
you
're
interested
I
have
a
job
for
you
,
"
she
said
shortly
.
"
Really
?
"
Paula
's
heart
leaped
.
"
You
mean
you
think
I
'm
good
enough
?
"
she
asked
tentatively
.
She
had
enjoyed
the
classes
but
the
first
thing
they
had
taught
her
was
how
much
she
did
not
know
,
denting
her
confidence
somewhat
,
and
she
was
still
terrified
of
the
daunting
Mrs
Frampton-Cox
.
"
You
've
done
quite
well
,
"
Arlene
conceded
,
keeping
to
herself
the
growing
excitement
with
which
she
had
been
watching
Paula
over
the
past
weeks
.
The
girl
had
something
-
quite
apart
from
her
natural
grace
and
outstanding
good
looks
,
quite
apart
from
the
lithe
,
leggy
body
that
was
simply
made
for
modelling
,
there
was
a
quality
about
her
that
made
her
stand
out
from
all
the
others
girls
in
the
class
,
which
drew
the
eye
and
held
it
,
so
that
even
someone
as
cynical
as
Arlene
looked
and
wanted
to
go
on
looking
.
Sometimes
,
in
fact
,
she
had
felt
she
was
in
danger
of
neglecting
the
rest
of
her
pupils
for
though
her
voice
continued
to
drone
on
,
snapping
out
an
instruction
here
,
a
correction
there
,
she
was
in
reality
watching
Paula
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
,
and
experiencing
the
same
excitement
of
discovery
that
she
had
felt
on
the
day
when
Paula
had
first
walked
into
her
office
.
The
girl
could
be
a
top
model
,
not
a
doubt
of
it
.
She
needed
a
little
experience
here
in
the
provinces
first
,
of
course
,
just
enough
to
give
her
finesse
and
confidence
,
not
too
much
so
that
she
became
jaded
,
and
then
-
I
can
get
her
work
in
London
-
I
know
it
!
Arlene
thought
,
barely
able
to
conceal
her
jubilation
.
Anyone
would
be
delighted
to
have
her
,
maybe
even
the
top
couture
houses
.
The
thought
was
a
heady
one
.
Though
she
had
been
quite
a
successful
model
herself
Arlene
had
never
reached
those
giddy
heights
-
the
thought
that
now
a
pupil
and
protege
of
hers
might
achieve
it
made
her
prickle
with
excitement
.
She
glanced
at
the
girl
standing
eagerly
in
front
of
her
.
"
It
's
a
fashion
show
for
charity
,
"
she
explained
.
"
Two
of
the
big
stores
in
town
are
getting
together
to
put
it
on
.
There
will
be
two
rehearsals
,
one
on
the
previous
Saturday
,
one
on
the
afternoon
of
the
show
.
I
shall
expect
you
to
be
there
promptly
,
with
a
selection
of
shoes
.
The
stores
will
provide
the
jewellery
and
accessories
.
The
show
is
on
the
Thursday
evening
,
by
the
way
.
Can
you
do
it
?
"
"
Oh
yes
!
"
Paula
breathed
.
Already
her
mind
was
busy
with
the
practical
problems
-
did
she
have
the
right
shoes
and
if
not
how
could
she
afford
to
buy
them
.
And
Thursday
was
not
one
of
her
days
off
-
how
could
she
be
free
in
the
afternoon
?
But
somehow
she
would
manage
it
.
She
'd
beg
,
borrow
or
steal
the
money
for
the
shoes
,
and
if
she
was
given
notice
at
the
store
when
she
insisted
on
having
the
afternoon
off
,
well
,
so
be
it
.
Modelling
was
going
to
be
her
career
from
now
on
.
And
she
was
going
to
make
sure
that
nothing
stood
in
her
way
!
Edward
had
a
car
-
an
ancient
but
still
magnificent-looking
Ford
Zephyr
.
When
Sally
got
off
the
bus
he
was
waiting
for
her
,
leaning
against
the
bonnet
,
smoking
a
cigarette
and
looking
more
than
ever
the
dashing
young
man-about-town
.
"
Well
,
what
do
you
think
?
"
he
asked
her
.
"
It
's
beautiful
!
"
she
gasped
,
much
impressed
.
"
I
thought
we
'd
go
for
a
drive
and
put
her
through
her
paces
,
"
he
suggested
.
Sally
agreed
readily
.
To
go
for
a
drive
in
a
boyfriend
's
car
seemed
the
height
of
sophistication
.
She
only
wished
there
was
someone
who
knew
her
to
see
her
climbing
in
.
The
car
had
a
bench
seat
in
the
front
and
smelled
of
warm
leather
and
old
cigarette
smoke
.
Edward
took
her
on
a
tour
of
Bath
-
perhaps
he
was
also
hoping
to
be
seen
by
someone
who
knew
him
!
-
and
then
headed
out
into
the
country
.
It
was
a
fine
warm
autumn
evening
and
although
the
light
was
already
dying
out
of
the
sky
the
trees
still
looked
magnificent
,
shades
of
gold
and
red
blending
with
some
still-green
foliage
.
As
they
bowled
along
the
country
roads
Sally
sat
erect
on
the
bench-seat
feeling
like
a
queen
.
After
about
an
hour
's
driving
Edward
pulled
onto
the
forecourt
of
a
country
pub
.
"
This
is
supposed
to
be
a
nice
place
,
"
he
said
.
"
All
the
best
pubs
are
out
of
town
.
"
The
pub
was
picturesque
and
cosy
with
beams
laden
with
gleaming
horse-brasses
,
farm
implements
on
the
walls
and
a
huge
inglenook
fireplace
.
They
found
a
wooden
bench
seat
in
a
corner
and
squeezed
into
it
with
their
drinks
-
Edward
had
a
pint
of
bitter
and
Sally
a
Babycham
in
a
pretty
glass
decorated
with
a
dancing
fawn
in
a
blue
neck-bow
.
Edward
put
his
arm
around
Sally
and
little
prickles
of
excitement
started
deep
inside
her
.
She
sat
quite
still
enjoying
them
.
Why
did
n't
they
last
when
Edward
tried
to
go
further
,
she
wondered
?
When
she
thought
about
the
things
he
did
they
became
even
sharper
,
so
that
it
felt
as
if
an
electric
shock
was
passing
right
through
the
centre
of
her
body
.
But
the
reality
was
different
.
All
the
lovely
prickles
and
twists
stopped
and
she
was
left
with
nothing
but
a
feeling
of
panic
,
able
to
think
of
nothing
but
how
could
she
stop
him
without
making
him
angry
.
And
afterwards
there
was
just
a
feeling
of
let-down
,
of
wanting
him
to
hold
her
and
kiss
her
and
pet
her
like
a
little
girl
.
No
-
pet
was
the
wrong
word
.
Petting
meant
doing
that
so
no
,
she
certainly
did
not
want
to
be
petted
and
much
less
to
pet
Edward
.
Perhaps
there
was
something
wrong
with
her
,
Sally
thought
glumly
.
"
This
is
the
life
?
"
Edward
said
,
squeezing
her
gently
.
"
What
a
day
!
"
"
We
had
some
excitement
at
home
yesterday
,
"
Sally
offered
.
"
My
sister
is
going
to
model
in
a
charity
show
.
I
told
you
she
was
taking
classes
,
did
n't
I
?
"
"
Yes
,
you
said
.
"
Naturally
Sally
talked
about
Paula
.
For
one
thing
she
was
very
proud
of
her
,
for
another
when
she
talked
about
her
lovely
sister
and
her
exciting
life
she
felt
as
if
some
of
the
glamour
rubbed
off
onto
her
.
But
Edward
had
never
met
Paula
.
"
Sounds
as
if
she
's
doing
well
,
"
Edward
said
.
"
I
know
.
She
's
only
done
half
the
course
and
already
she
has
been
picked
out
for
this
job
.
I
think
she
's
going
to
go
a
long
way
-
which
she
deserves
to
.
"
Sally
speared
the
cherry
which
was
floating
in
her
Babycham
and
popped
it
into
her
mouth
.
"
Where
is
the
show
?
"
Edward
asked
.
"
Bristol
.
Why
?
"
"
Do
n't
you
think
we
ought
to
go
along
and
support
her
?
"
Sally
was
so
surprised
she
almost
choked
on
her
cherry
.
She
did
not
think
men
were
interested
in
fashion
.
"
Now
that
I
've
got
the
car
we
can
do
things
like
that
,
"
Edward
went
on
.
"
We
could
take
your
sister
home
afterwards
-
if
she
wants
a
lift
,
that
is
.
"
"
So
we
could
,
"
Sally
said
,
pleased
.
The
thought
that
she
was
the
one
with
a
boyfriend
with
a
car
made
her
feel
very
important
-
one
up
on
Paula
for
a
change
!
They
finished
their
drinks
and
left
.
It
was
completely
dark
by
now
,
a
black
velvety
night
sprinkled
with
stars
.
Sally
sat
close
to
Edward
on
the
bench
seat
and
he
drove
with
one
arm
around
her
,
somehow
managing
to
change
gear
with
his
right
hand
.
When
they
were
almost
home
Edward
pulled
into
a
farm
gateway
and
turned
off
the
engine
.
He
pulled
Sally
close
,
kissing
her
,
and
she
wound
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
enjoying
the
first
little
prickles
of
yearning
.
All
too
soon
however
his
hands
began
their
usual
wandering
,
slipping
inside
her
blouse
to
unclip
her
bra
hooks
,
pushing
her
skirt
well
up
her
thighs
and
trying
to
slip
her
panties
off
.
Sally
sat
down
hard
on
them
,
forcing
her
legs
together
,
but
as
usual
in
the
end
he
won
and
she
retrieved
the
panties
from
the
floor
,
pushing
them
behind
her
on
the
seat
before
they
were
trampled
underfoot
.
"
Let's
get
in
the
back
.
It
would
be
much
more
comfortable
,
"
Edward
suggested
.
"
No
!
"
Sally
said
,
realising
the
dangers
of
the
back
seat
.
"
We
ought
to
be
getting
home
.
Mum
will
be
expecting
me
to
be
on
the
bus
,
remember
.
"
Edward
ignored
her
protest
,
somehow
contorting
himself
so
that
he
could
kiss
her
breasts
,
bare
now
,
since
her
bra
was
around
her
waist
,
and
still
keep
his
hand
between
her
legs
beneath
the
rucked-up
skirt
.
Something
about
the
feel
of
his
lips
tugging
at
her
nipples
began
to
excite
Sally
and
though
she
still
felt
nothing
but
discomfort
from
his
probing
finger
she
relaxed
a
little
,
leaning
her
head
back
into
the
corner
provided
by
the
bench
seat
and
the
window
.
It
really
was
a
rather
pleasant
sensation
.
Edward
contorted
again
,
biting
first
at
her
throat
and
then
kissing
her
full
on
the
mouth
,
forcing
her
lips
apart
with
his
tongue
.
Sally
could
taste
the
cigarettes
and
beer
and
found
that
that
too
was
exciting
.
Then
somehow
she
was
spreadeagled
along
the
seat
and
he
was
half-kneeling
,
half
-lying
on
top
of
her
and
suddenly
she
did
not
think
that
what
was
between
her
legs
was
his
finger
.
It
was
less
sharp
,
bigger
,
hotter
and
instead
of
scratching
painfully
it
felt
good
.
Carefully
Sally
moved
against
it
and
felt
a
sort
of
yearning
begin
in
the
sensitised
area
between
her
thighs
.
She
moved
again
experimentally
.
It
was
nice
-
oooh
,
really
nice
.
Edward
was
still
kissing
her
,
his
tongue
circling
inside
her
mouth
,
but
all
she
could
think
about
was
this
new
sensation
between
her
legs
,
a
little
like
the
way
she
felt
when
they
danced
,
but
even
better
.
"
Oh
,
Sally
!
"
he
whispered
,
his
breath
ragged
.
Then
suddenly
he
lunged
and
the
pleasant
sensation
was
gone
,
replaced
not
by
pain
but
by
a
strange
,
full
feeling
and
Sally
began
to
feel
frightened
again
.
She
wanted
him
to
stop
yet
at
the
same
time
wanted
him
to
go
on
in
the
hope
that
the
lovely
sensations
would
begin
again
.
She
was
also
dimly
aware
that
they
had
passed
the
point
of
no
return
-
now
she
had
allowed
him
inside
her
it
seemed
wrong
to
yell
at
him
to
stop
or
begin
fighting
him
.
After
a
few
thrusting
minutes
Edward
gave
a
strangled
cry
that
seemed
to
come
from
deep
in
his
throat
and
jerked
out
of
her
.
He
sprawled
back
behind
the
steering
wheel
,
eyes
closed
,
breathing
heavily
and
clutching
a
handkerchief
to
himself
.
Sally
lay
without
moving
,
looking
at
him
in
the
light
of
the
moon
.
She
felt
stunned
,
as
if
what
he
had
done
to
her
had
somehow
paralysed
not
only
her
limbs
but
her
senses
too
,
leaving
her
tense
.
There
was
no
satisfaction
,
no
pleasure
,
just
a
kind
of
aching
emptiness
.
Then
suddenly
she
became
aware
of
how
inelegant
she
must
look
,
sprawled
there
with
her
skirt
up
around
her
hips
and
her
bra
dangling
out
of
her
open
blouse
.
She
sat
up
,
straightening
her
clothes
just
as
Edward
opened
the
steamed-up
window
of
the
car
and
dumped
the
handkerchief
out
into
the
hedge
.
"
You
wo
n't
have
any
hankies
left
as
this
rate
,
"
she
said
,
then
giggled
with
embarrassment
.
What
a
stupid
thing
to
have
said
!
"
Who
cares
?
"
Edward
asked
grandly
.
He
reached
for
her
to
kiss
her
again
and
Sally
clung
to
him
hoping
that
somehow
the
contact
would
make
everything
come
right
.
But
after
a
minute
he
put
her
away
and
started
the
engine
.
"
I
'd
better
get
you
home
,
"
he
said
.
Sally
felt
like
crying
again
.
There
must
be
something
wrong
with
her
.
They
'd
gone
all
the
way
and
still
she
did
n't
feel
any
of
the
things
one
was
supposed
to
feel
-
elated
,
contented
,
together
.
Now
that
it
was
over
Edward
seemed
to
have
gone
a
very
long
way
away
from
her
,
as
if
she
was
no
more
than
a
stranger
to
whom
he
was
giving
a
lift
.
For
the
remainder
of
the
journey
she
fiddled
with
her
clothes
,
trying
to
make
sure
she
would
look
respectable
when
she
arrived
home
and
arranging
the
neck
of
her
blouse
to
cover
her
throat
where
she
was
sure
she
must
have
another
love
bite
.
"
See
you
on
Saturday
-
same
place
?
"
Edward
said
as
he
stopped
the
car
outside
her
house
.
Sally
nodded
,
the
feeling
of
let-down
growing
.
She
had
hoped
he
might
arrange
to
come
and
collect
her
now
that
he
had
the
car
-
and
now
that
things
were
,
well
,
serious
between
them
.
But
she
did
n't
like
to
suggest
it
.
As
she
slammed
the
car
door
she
saw
curtains
at
lighted
windows
twitching
up
and
down
the
road
.
Well
,
at
least
he
'd
brought
her
home
.
At
least
the
neighbours
would
know
she
had
a
boyfriend
with
a
car
.
Walking
up
the
path
to
the
front
door
on
legs
that
felt
slightly
wobbly
Sally
realised
she
would
have
to
be
satisfied
with
that
.
Sally
and
Edward
sat
in
the
very
front
row
of
the
audience
at
the
Fashion
Show
on
canvas
hospital-style
chairs
.
Two
feet
in
front
of
them
was
the
catwalk
,
a
bare
narrow
wooden
platform
angling
away
from
a
curtained
entrance
.
Sally
stared
at
the
curtains
wondering
what
was
going
on
behind
them
.
Chaos
,
probably
.
Paula
had
told
her
there
were
twelve
models
in
the
show
and
each
of
them
had
to
wear
at
least
ten
outfits
.
One
hundred
and
twenty
outfits
,
not
to
mention
all
the
shoes
and
hats
and
gloves
.
How
on
earth
did
they
keep
track
of
them
all
?
When
she
was
dressing
to
go
out
Sally
was
invariably
unable
to
find
the
belt
she
wanted
,
one
shoe
had
gone
missing
or
one
stocking
developed
a
ladder
.
But
one
hundred
and
twenty
outfits
-
what
a
nightmare
!
She
glanced
around
at
the
audience
who
were
appearing
in
twos
and
threes
.
Mostly
they
were
very
smart
women
in
suits
and
soft
draped
dresses
.
Sally
had
agonised
over
what
to
wear
-
she
was
so
afraid
of
letting
Paula
down
-
but
eventually
she
had
settled
on
a
neat
shirt-waister
blouse
and
pencil
skirt
and
Paula
had
loaned
her
a
poplin
duster
coat
in
duck-egg
blue
with
a
thick
soft
grey
Lucca
Lamb
collar
.
Sally
felt
good
in
it
-
the
fur
was
gorgeously
soft
when
she
buried
her
chin
in
it
and
she
thought
that
at
least
she
could
hold
her
own
in
the
midst
of
all
this
elegance
.
The
background
music
stopped
and
was
replaced
by
an
expectant
hum
,
then
that
too
ceased
as
the
curtains
parted
and
a
man
in
a
dinner
jacket
and
black
bow
tie
stepped
out
onto
the
catwalk
.
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
-
welcome
!
"
he
boomed
.
His
microphone
whistled
a
little
and
Sally
winced
in
embarrassment
.
The
first
model
appeared
on
the
catwalk
,
looking
so
glamorous
,
so
unbelievably
chic
,
that
Sally
could
scarcely
believe
that
her
very
own
sister
could
be
a
part
of
this
glittering
performance
.
But
a
few
moments
later
there
she
was
-
tall
and
beautiful
in
a
little
green
boucle
dress
with
matching
jacket
.
"
It
's
her
-
it
's
Paula
!
"
Sally
hissed
,
almost
falling
off
her
chair
in
excitement
.
"
That
is
?
"
Edward
whispered
back
,
stunned
.
"
Yes
,
does
n't
she
look
marvellous
?
"
Someone
behind
them
coughed
pointedly
and
they
went
quiet
but
Sally
was
wishing
she
could
shout
to
the
whole
room
:
"
That
's
my
sister
!
"
She
was
so
proud
she
thought
she
would
burst
.
And
so
happy
and
excited
that
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
worry
about
the
devastating
effect
Paula
was
having
on
Edward
.
Behind
the
scenes
Paula
slipped
out
of
one
outfit
,
letting
it
fall
to
the
floor
,
and
reached
for
the
next
,
hanging
in
the
correct
order
on
her
clothes
rail
.
The
girl
who
was
dressing
her
pulled
up
the
zipper
while
Paula
kicked
off
a
pair
of
black
suede
shoes
and
eased
her
feet
into
crocodile
ones
.
A
quick
flick
of
a
comb
through
her
hair
-
there
was
no
hat
to
accessorise
this
dress
-
she
reached
for
the
crocodile
clutch
bag
and
moved
towards
the
doorway
for
Arlene
to
give
her
a
quick
check
before
she
stepped
out
onto
the
catwalk
again
.
She
felt
alive
as
never
before
,
and
her
eyes
were
glittering
with
excitement
.
Her
initial
nerves
had
all
gone
now
although
it
still
felt
strange
to
be
on
a
catwalk
rather
than
the
carpeted
floor
of
the
room
at
the
Grand
Hotel
.
Arlene
gave
her
a
small
push
to
indicate
it
was
time
and
she
moved
out
.
She
could
n't
wait
to
be
back
under
the
lights
again
with
all
eyes
on
her
.
As
she
sashayed
down
the
catwalk
she
caught
sight
of
Sally
and
Edward
.
The
first
time
out
she
had
seen
nothing
but
a
sea
of
faces
,
so
hard
had
she
been
concentrating
on
what
she
was
doing
.
Now
she
let
her
eyes
dwell
on
them
for
a
moment
-
Sally
glowing
with
pride
,
Edward
with
a
slightly
dazed
expression
on
his
handsome
face
.
Not
bad
!
Paula
thought
.
Not
bad
at
all
.
You
have
quite
a
catch
there
,
little
sister
.
She
did
not
dare
look
at
them
for
too
long
for
fear
of
missing
her
footing
or
forgetting
a
move
but
the
look
on
Edward
's
face
added
another
notch
to
her
enjoyment
.
She
twirled
slowly
,
feeling
his
eyes
on
her
so
that
it
was
as
though
she
was
receiving
an
injection
of
adrenalin
.
Oh
how
she
was
enjoying
herself
!
She
wanted
it
to
go
on
for
ever
and
ever
!
She
was
back
at
the
curtains
again
.
Time
to
turn
,
hold
one
last
pose
,
then
move
out
.
But
there
were
still
eight
outfits
to
go
.
Paula
intended
to
make
the
most
of
every
one
of
them
.
"
Well
,
did
you
enjoy
it
?
"
"
Oh
yes
!
Paula
,
you
were
wonderful
!
"
The
show
was
over
,
the
audience
had
drifted
away
to
a
reception
room
where
they
would
be
further
wooed
with
a
glass
of
champagne
and
a
selection
of
canapes
and
nibbles
and
Paula
,
dressed
now
in
one
of
her
own
suits
,
smart
black
barathea
,
had
emerged
from
the
dressing
rooms
to
meet
the
waiting
Sally
and
Edward
.
She
was
still
on
a
"
high
"
,
the
potent
adrenalin
pumping
through
her
veins
,
eyes
sparkling
,
cheeks
glowing
with
a
becoming
flush
that
owed
nothing
to
the
skilfully
applied
make-up
.
"
Did
you
see
anything
you
'd
like
to
buy
?
"
"
Oh
yes
-
everything
!
But
you
know
very
well
I
ca
n't
.
And
anyway
,
it
was
you
we
came
to
see
.
"
"
You
were
n't
supposed
to
be
looking
at
me
.
You
were
supposed
to
be
looking
at
the
clothes
,
"
Paula
said
artlessly
.
She
was
watching
Edward
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
Yes
,
he
was
every
bit
as
good
looking
as
she
had
thought
he
was
when
she
had
glimpsed
him
from
the
catwalk
.
And
he
owned
a
car
!
Not
bad
at
all
.
He
was
only
an
office
worker
,
of
course
,
a
clerk
of
sorts
,
Sally
had
said
,
not
quite
in
the
class
that
Paula
intended
to
aim
at
,
but
very
presentable
for
all
that
.
And
to
think
he
was
going
out
with
Sally
!
The
fact
was
somehow
offensive
to
Paula
's
ego
.
In
that
moment
she
made
up
her
mind
.
She
did
n't
really
want
him
,
of
course
but
she
simply
had
to
prove
to
herself
that
he
would
prefer
her
to
Sally
,
given
the
choice
.
She
smiled
at
him
and
felt
his
quickening
interest
.
It
was
so
easy
,
so
incredibly
easy
.
What
was
the
expression
?
"
Taking
candy
from
a
baby
.
"
It
summed
up
the
situation
perfectly
.
"
Did
Sally
say
you
might
be
able
to
squeeze
me
into
your
car
?
"
she
asked
,
fluttering
her
eyelashes
.
"
Hardly
squeeze
,
"
Sally
began
,
embarrassed
,
then
broke
off
.
Edward
was
not
listening
.
Neither
of
them
were
.
Edward
was
staring
at
Paula
and
Sally
did
not
like
the
expression
on
his
face
.
She
felt
the
pit
of
her
stomach
fall
away
.
"
It
's
a
big
car
,
"
she
finished
lamely
.
"
Are
you
sure
I
'm
not
making
a
nuisance
of
myself
?
"
Paula
gushed
.
"
Of
course
not
.
I
have
to
drive
Sally
home
anyway
.
"
The
way
he
said
it
made
Sally
feel
like
a
parcel
for
delivery
.
"
I
wo
n't
be
long
.
I
'll
just
get
my
things
-
"
Paula
disappeared
through
the
swing
doors
.
Edward
gazed
after
her
.
There
was
a
glow
about
him
that
all
men
had
when
they
were
around
Paula
.
Sally
felt
sick
.
"
What
are
we
going
to
do
on
Saturday
?
"
she
asked
,
catching
at
his
arm
,
desperate
for
reassurance
.
"
Hmm
?
Oh
-
I
do
n't
know
.
Where
does
your
sister
go
?
Perhaps
we
could
make
up
a
party
.
That
would
be
fun
.
"
For
you
,
maybe
,
not
for
me
!
Sally
thought
.
Paula
reappeared
,
carrying
the
little
modelling
case
she
had
had
to
buy
and
equip
with
cosmetics
,
shoes
and
spare
tights
.
"
I
was
just
saying
to
Sally
,
why
do
n't
you
come
out
with
us
on
Saturday
?
"
Edward
suggested
.
"
We
could
go
as
a
crowd
.
"
"
Oh
what
a
shame
!
I
've
already
made
arrangements
for
this
week
.
"
But
her
eyes
were
flashing
-
nice
try
,
Edward
.
Ask
again
sometime
.
Who
knows
?
"
Are
you
ready
?
"
Sally
asked
.
All
the
shine
had
gone
out
of
the
evening
.
Suddenly
all
she
wanted
to
do
was
get
home
and
bury
her
head
under
her
pillow
.
On
Saturday
Edward
was
late
.
Sally
was
frantic
.
He
had
never
let
her
down
before
.
Suppose
something
had
happened
to
him
?
She
waited
and
waited
,
the
feeling
of
living
a
nightmare
that
had
been
with
her
ever
since
Thursday
intensifying
.
At
last
just
as
she
was
contemplating
getting
the
next
bus
home
he
arrived
.
She
ran
to
meet
him
,
weak
with
relief
,
but
he
was
very
vague
as
to
why
he
was
late
and
there
was
a
remoteness
about
him
that
she
could
not
penetrate
.
Something
was
wrong
she
knew
though
she
could
not
have
said
what
it
was
and
she
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
when
he
made
some
excuse
about
being
a
bit
busy
next
week
and
unable
to
see
her
.
When
he
stopped
the
car
on
the
way
home
Sally
threw
herself
at
him
.
Tonight
she
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
let
him
do
anything
he
wanted
just
as
long
as
things
would
go
back
to
being
the
way
they
had
been
.
But
Edward
just
did
n't
seem
interested
.
"
When
will
I
see
you
again
?
"
she
asked
desperately
.
"
I
'll
be
in
touch
,
"
he
said
vaguely
and
though
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
would
admit
it
to
herself
Sally
knew
it
was
all
over
.
That
night
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
wondering
where
she
had
gone
wrong
and
thinking
she
could
not
bear
it
if
she
never
saw
Edward
again
.
It
was
probably
because
she
was
always
so
reluctant
to
let
him
make
love
to
her
,
she
decided
.
Everyone
knew
it
was
what
boys
wanted
.
If
only
she
had
been
a
bit
more
accommodating
,
a
bit
more
enthusiastic
.
As
it
was
he
had
obviously
grown
tired
of
the
regular
struggles
and
gone
off
to
find
someone
who
gave
in
more
readily
.
But
in
spite
of
what
had
happened
at
the
fashion
show
she
did
not
think
Paula
had
any
hand
in
it
until
next
day
at
breakfast
.
Paula
,
nibbling
an
Energen
roll
spread
with
reduced-calorie
marmalade
,
said
airily
:
"
Oh
,
who
do
you
think
came
into
the
store
yesterday
?
Your
friend
Edward
!
And
I
think
you
should
know
he
wanted
me
to
go
out
with
him
.
"
Sally
began
to
tremble
.
"
What
did
you
say
?
"
she
asked
.
"
That
I
could
n't
possibly
two-time
you
,
of
course
,
"
Paula
said
,
watching
Sally
slyly
.
"
I
told
him
that
whilst
he
was
dating
my
own
sister
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
.
He
argued
,
of
course
-
said
that
there
was
nothing
serious
between
the
two
of
you
and
you
knew
that
.
But
I
was
adamant
all
the
same
.
"
Her
eyes
narrowed
.
"
You
are
still
going
out
with
him
,
are
n't
you
?
"
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
Sally
said
miserably
.
"
Well
the
rat
!
"
Paula
said
,
but
she
looked
pleased
.
"
You
-
you
would
n't
go
out
with
him
,
would
you
,
Paula
?
"
Sally
asked
,
hating
herself
for
still
wanting
him
.
"
Oh
Sally
,
what
do
you
think
I
am
?
"
Sally
did
not
answer
.
She
did
not
think
Paula
would
have
liked
what
she
had
to
say
.
Edward
never
did
get
in
touch
with
Sally
again
.
She
was
sick
with
wretchedness
,
convinced
she
had
only
herself
to
blame
-
and
of
course
the
devastating
effect
Paula
had
on
men
-
but
still
puzzled
that
it
could
have
ended
so
suddenly
without
a
word
of
explanation
on
his
part
.
Besides
being
heart-broken
she
felt
foolish
and
a
failure
.
But
she
never
did
find
out
if
he
was
successful
in
persuading
Paula
to
go
out
with
him
now
that
he
was
free
.
She
did
not
want
to
know
.
Once
,
months
later
,
when
she
went
to
the
Regency
on
a
Saturday
night
with
some
girlfriends
she
practically
bumped
into
him
on
the
stairs
.
But
he
merely
looked
embarrassed
and
said
:
"
Oh
-
hi
!
"
as
he
passed
as
if
she
was
just
a
casual
acquaintance
.
During
the
evening
she
caught
sight
of
him
a
few
times
,
always
dancing
,
holding
his
partners
very
close
,
and
managing
to
avoid
her
eyes
.
After
that
night
Sally
never
saw
him
again
.
"
I
have
a
very
important
assignment
for
you
,
Paula
,
"
Arlene
Frampton-Cox
said
.
She
inserted
a
Du
Maurier
cigarette
into
her
long
tortoiseshell
holder
and
sat
back
,
looking
at
Paula
,
who
was
seated
in
the
visitor
's
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
,
long
legs
crossed
elegantly
.
Paula
looked
every
inch
a
model
these
days
,
Arlene
thought
with
a
touch
of
proprietorial
pride
.
Her
long
hair
,
shining
gold
,
was
swept
back
and
caught
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
with
a
bow
,
make-up
,
expertly
applied
,
accentuated
the
classically
beautiful
lines
of
her
face
,
and
she
wore
her
well-cut
suit
with
all
the
panache
that
was
expected
of
her
.
A
good
suit
was
a
working
model
's
uniform
-
Paula
now
bought
two
each
season
and
wore
them
with
perfectly
matching
accessories
,
hat
,
bag
and
shoes
.
This
one
was
in
soft
light
green
with
a
boxy
shaped
jacket
and
narrow
skirt
and
the
same
green-and-white
check
material
of
the
little
sleeveless
blouse
had
been
used
to
line
the
jacket
and
face
the
wide
reveres
.
Paula
's
bag
and
shoes
were
patent
black
leather
,
her
gloves
white
,
and
she
carried
a
long
walking
umbrella
neatly
furled
in
its
fur-trimmed
case
.
Perfectly
groomed
from
head
to
toe
and
with
all
that
assurance
,
she
was
ready
to
take
on
the
world
,
Arlene
thought
with
satisfaction
,
for
she
looked
on
Paula
as
her
very
own
creation
.
The
raw
materials
might
have
been
there
before
-
indeed
,
had
n't
it
been
she
,
Arlene
,
who
had
spotted
them
?
But
the
transformation
of
a
leggy
young
filly
into
a
sleekly
beautiful
racehorse
had
been
her
doing
.
eighteen
months
on
the
model
circuit
had
eliminated
all
trace
of
her
former
Somerset
accent
.
She
had
listened
to
Arlene
's
own
voice
and
set
about
imitating
it
for
she
held
her
mentor
in
the
highest
esteem
whilst
still
being
a
little
afraid
of
her
.
The
House
of
Mattli
is
expanding
from
couture
into
ready-to-wear
and
one
of
the
big
Bristol
stores
,
Taylors
,
are
putting
on
a
show
to
publicise
the
fact
that
they
will
be
stocking
the
new
pret-a-porter
'
,
Arlene
explained
.
"
I
have
been
asked
to
supply
the
models
and
I
would
like
you
to
be
one
of
them
.
"
"
Mattli
!
"
Paula
repeated
,
impressed
.
The
House
of
Mattli
was
a
husband
and
wife
team
who
were
numbered
amongst
the
top
ten
names
in
the
Incorporated
Society
of
London
Fashion
Designers
.
Furthermore
Madame
Mattli
was
a
Frenchwoman
,
an
accident
of
birth
which
added
to
her
glamour
,
for
was
not
Paris
the
fashion
capital
of
the
world
?
"
Madame
Mattli
will
be
coming
to
Bristol
herself
,
"
Arlene
continued
.
"
Taylors
have
a
certain
amount
of
stock
but
she
will
be
bringing
extra
samples
from
London
especially
for
the
show
.
I
only
want
the
best
of
my
girls
on
this
job
.
Madame
Mattli
,
remember
,
is
used
to
the
best
.
We
ca
n't
afford
any
sloppiness
.
I
can
count
on
you
,
Paula
,
I
feel
sure
.
"
"
Oh
yes
,
"
Paula
said
,
brimming
with
suppressed
excitement
.
"
You
can
count
on
me
!
"
Madame
Mattli
was
almost
exactly
as
Paula
had
imagined
she
would
be
,
a
petite
perfectly
turned
out
woman
with
an
air
of
chic
that
was
unmistakably
French
.
Her
dark
,
grey-streaked
hair
,
which
she
wore
in
a
long
bob
,
had
been
cut
by
Vidal
Sassoon
and
she
wore
a
beautifully
tailored
black
suit
relieved
only
by
a
little
white
flounce
at
the
neckline
.
In
the
fitting
rooms
at
Taylors
she
fussed
and
fretted
over
her
creations
like
a
mother
hen
and
though
Paula
was
overawed
by
the
great
designer
she
also
liked
her
on
sight
.
Madame
Mattli
might
be
a
stickler
for
detail
,
with
a
generous
helping
of
the
artistic
temperament
which
kept
her
tight-coiled
as
a
spring
and
which
would
explode
into
frenzy
if
the
smallest
detail
was
not
as
it
should
be
,
but
she
also
had
a
kind
face
and
deep
perceptive
eyes
.
Half
way
through
the
day
's
programme
of
shows
,
while
the
dressers
went
off
to
grab
a
sandwich
and
the
model
girls
,
who
would
not
dare
to
eat
while
they
were
showing
,
revived
themselves
with
cups
of
black
coffee
,
Madame
Mattli
took
Paula
to
one
side
.
"
Little
one
,
I
would
like
to
speak
with
you
.
"
Paula
's
stomach
turned
a
somersault
.
Had
she
done
something
wrong
?
"
I
have
been
watching
you
work
,
"
Madame
Mattli
said
directly
.
Her
accent
reminded
Paula
of
Louise
-
perhaps
that
was
why
she
warmed
to
her
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
so
awe-inspiring
.
"
You
are
exactly
right
for
a
couture
model
.
You
have
all
the
physical
attributes
.
"
"
Thank
you
,
"
Paula
said
faintly
.
Madame
Mattli
waved
a
dismissive
hand
.
"
Do
not
thank
me
.
I
am
not
saying
this
to
make
your
head
swell
.
On
the
contrary
.
The
fact
is
that
I
have
a
vacancy
arising
for
a
couture
model
.
I
believe
you
are
exactly
what
I
am
looking
for
.
I
would
like
you
to
come
to
London
to
work
for
me
.
"
Over
Madame
Mattli
's
shoulder
Paula
could
see
Arlene
watching
her
,
a
tiny
smile
lifting
one
corner
of
her
scarlet
mouth
,
and
Paula
knew
her
well
enough
by
now
to
know
exactly
what
she
was
thinking
.
She
did
not
want
to
lose
Paula
,
who
was
one
of
her
best
models
,
but
already
she
was
enjoying
the
reflected
glory
that
came
from
having
personally
trained
a
house
model
for
one
of
the
great
London
couture
houses
.
She
had
known
about
the
vacancy
at
Mattli
and
hoped
that
the
job
might
be
offered
to
Paula
.
It
was
the
seal
of
approval
for
her
own
judgement
.
"
Well
?
"
Madame
Mattli
demanded
.
"
Can
I
have
a
little
time
to
think
it
over
?
"
Paula
asked
boldly
.
"
A
little
.
But
please
do
not
delay
too
long
.
My
present
house
model
leaves
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
there
are
plenty
of
girls
who
would
jump
at
the
chance
.
"
"
I
'm
sure
.
But
all
the
same
I
could
n't
make
such
a
move
without
giving
it
some
thought
,
"
Paula
said
grandly
.
But
inside
she
was
bubbling
with
excitement
.
Time
to
think
?
She
did
n't
need
a
single
second
.
The
moment
Madame
Mattli
had
offered
her
the
job
she
had
made
up
her
mind
.
She
was
going
to
take
it
-
of
course
!
A
month
later
Paula
,
smartly
dressed
in
a
new
tweed
suit
with
the
obligatory
matching
bag
and
shoes
,
and
lugging
both
her
modelling
case
and
a
brand
new
cream
leather
suitcase
,
took
the
train
to
London
to
begin
her
new
career
.
She
had
booked
herself
a
bed
at
a
YWCA
hostel
for
the
time
being
.
It
was
not
quite
what
she
envisaged
for
herself
but
it
had
the
advantage
of
being
cheap
and
it
went
some
way
towards
satisfying
Grace
,
who
was
convinced
that
London
was
a
den
of
iniquity
waiting
to
swallow
up
her
unsuspecting
daughter
.
From
the
hostel
it
was
only
a
short
tube
ride
to
South
Audley
Street
where
Madame
Mattli
had
her
showrooms
-
yet
another
advantage
,
Paula
thought
,
trying
to
weigh
up
the
points
in
favour
of
the
hostel
,
which
she
hated
on
sight
.
Sharing
a
small
spartan
room
with
two
other
girls
-
Northerners
whose
accent
Paula
found
almost
incomprehensible
and
with
whom
she
had
nothing
in
common
,
making
breakfast
in
the
communal
kitchen
,
queuing
for
the
bath
,
adhering
to
a
strict
curfew
after
which
time
the
doors
were
locked
and
bolted
-
none
of
these
were
restrictions
Paula
had
the
slightest
intention
of
enduring
for
long
.
But
for
now
it
would
have
to
do
.
And
at
least
she
was
in
London
,
centre
of
the
British
fashion
industry
.
As
for
the
House
of
Mattli
,
it
might
have
been
in
a
different
world
to
the
hostel
,
with
its
air
of
being
a
cross
between
a
workhouse
and
a
boarding
school
.
The
first
time
she
rang
the
bell
and
went
in
through
the
front
doors
of
the
elegant
old
house
where
the
showrooms
were
situated
(
Mattli
had
no
rear
entrance
)
Paula
felt
she
was
stepping
into
the
place
of
her
dreams
.
Deep
carpet
covered
the
floors
and
the
stairs
swept
up
to
the
showrooms
and
the
warren
of
workrooms
beyond
,
and
though
the
window
drapes
and
furnishings
were
ever-so-slightly
faded
,
as
if
they
had
seen
better
days
,
they
were
of
the
finest
silks
and
velvets
and
every
corner
was
swept
,
polished
and
cleaned
daily
so
that
no
single
speck
of
dust
,
let
alone
a
cobweb
,
dared
show
itself
.
The
showroom
was
neither
large
nor
small
,
decorated
in
muted
shades
of
aubergine
which
would
not
detract
from
the
clothes
.
There
was
a
low
table
and
three
or
four
dainty
chairs
with
aubergine
velvet
seats
and
gilded
spindle
legs
.
The
crystal
chandelier
was
for
effect
only
-
lighting
that
would
show
off
the
clothes
to
their
best
advantage
was
brilliant
yet
discreet
,
and
along
one
wall
were
racks
holding
some
of
the
ready-to-wear
garments
.
In
contrast
to
this
elegant
frontage
the
workrooms
beyond
were
a
hive
of
frenzied
activity
.
Pattern
cutters
,
fitters
,
sewing
hands
and
their
assistants
all
worked
at
an
incredible
speed
.
This
,
Paula
soon
discovered
,
was
the
way
of
the
fashion
world
-
a
constant
frantic
rush
against
the
clock
,
to
have
collections
ready
on
time
or
to
complete
individual
couture
garments
for
customers
who
always
considered
their
order
more
urgent
,
more
important
,
than
that
of
anyone
else
.
Paula
was
amazed
by
the
security
arrangements
that
were
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
new
season
's
collections
remained
exclusive
-
the
windows
at
the
rear
of
the
premises
were
heavily
barred
and
practically
the
first
thing
she
had
to
do
on
commencing
her
employment
was
to
sign
a
contract
promising
that
she
would
not
breathe
a
word
about
the
designs
she
saw
.
On
her
second
day
Madame
Mattli
took
her
to
Vidal
Sassoon
's
salon
in
Grosvenor
House
so
that
her
hair
could
be
cut
in
an
up-to-the-minute
style
.
Unlike
some
couturiers
Madame
did
not
mind
if
her
model
girls
did
not
have
the
same
colour
hair
but
she
did
insist
on
identical
styles
.
By
the
time
Vidal
Sassoon
had
finished
with
her
Paula
's
long
fair
locks
had
been
shorn
to
a
sharp
geometric
shape
and
she
scarcely
recognised
the
reflection
that
looked
back
at
her
from
the
mirror
.
Among
the
rich
and
famous
who
had
come
to
the
salon
to
have
their
hair
cut
,
tinted
and
set
,
Paula
recognised
Dusty
Springfield
,
the
pop
singer
,
her
eyes
big
and
sooty
,
her
lips
pearly
pink
,
and
was
unable
to
suppress
the
thrill
of
excitement
which
ran
through
her
.
This
was
her
very
first
taste
of
only
the
best
being
good
enough
-
and
she
liked
it
!
It
was
Paula
's
job
to
show
samples
,
parading
slowly
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
clients
as
they
sat
on
the
elegant
spindle-leg
chairs
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
garments
with
a
critical
and
practised
eye
.
Sometimes
they
came
alone
,
sometimes
with
a
man
in
tow
-
to
foot
the
bill
!
Paula
guessed
.
The
appearance
of
a
famous
face
in
the
show
rooms
always
caused
a
stir
amongst
the
girls
,
who
all
longed
to
hook
a
wealthy
husband
-
and
if
he
had
a
title
,
like
the
Aly
Khan
,
or
was
a
film
star
like
Omar
Shariff
,
then
so
much
the
better
!
Not
everything
that
Paula
had
to
do
was
quite
so
glamorous
,
however
.
In
the
long
hours
when
there
were
no
customers
to
show
she
was
expected
to
lend
a
hand
with
some
of
the
unskilled
tasks
-
running
errands
and
making
tea
,
unpicking
a
seam
or
a
hem
,
even
sewing
on
a
button
or
a
hook
and
eye
when
she
had
been
taught
the
proper
way
to
do
it
.
Paula
was
not
very
clever
with
her
needle
but
she
soon
learned
to
be
careful
so
as
not
to
incur
the
wrath
of
the
seamstress
.
There
were
new
tricks
of
modelling
to
be
learned
too
-
how
to
remove
a
coat
,
sliding
It
carefully
off
her
shoulders
with
the
sleeves
hanging
in
perfect
balance
,
never
for
one
moment
allowing
the
inside
to
be
on
view
,
for
samples
were
often
unlined
.
This
trick
took
hours
of
practice
,
up
and
down
the
landing
at
the
hostel
while
the
other
girls
looked
at
her
as
if
she
had
taken
leave
of
her
senses
.
Although
she
enjoyed
her
job
Paula
was
lonely
.
Even
the
most
popular
of
girls
soon
discovered
that
in
this
highly
competitive
world
where
models
vied
with
one
another
for
the
most
glamorous
jobs
and
the
wealthiest
and
best-looking
men
there
was
far
more
bitchiness
than
in
the
provinces
-
and
Paula
was
far
from
popular
.
The
other
girls
disliked
her
for
her
outstanding
looks
and
her
haughty
ways
and
made
no
attempt
to
be
friendly
on
anything
but
the
most
superficial
level
and
the
pattern
cutters
and
sewing
hands
hurried
home
to
their
families
and
boyfriends
the
moment
they
finished
their
long
day
's
work
.
Paula
spent
most
of
her
free
time
alone
,
window
shopping
,
visiting
News
Theatres
,
where
she
sometimes
watched
the
programme
of
cartoons
twice
round
,
and
drinking
endless
cups
of
Espresso
coffee
in
cafes
and
coffee
houses
.
Her
favourite
was
the
coffee
shop
in
Fenwicks
in
Bond
Street
for
this
was
the
haunt
and
the
meeting
place
of
all
those
from
the
world
of
fashion
.
One
lunchtime
when
she
had
been
at
the
House
of
Mattli
for
a
few
months
Paula
went
there
for
her
usual
coffee
and
the
cottage
cheese
salad
that
was
her
staple
diet
now
that
it
was
so
important
that
she
did
not
add
a
single
half-inch
to
her
wand-slim
figure
.
She
took
her
tray
to
the
pay
desk
,
opened
her
bag
and
felt
for
her
purse
.
It
was
not
there
.
Frantically
she
rooted
round
,
then
checked
her
pockets
without
success
.
"
I
'm
sorry
.
I
seem
to
have
lost
my
purse
-
"
she
explained
.
The
girl
behind
the
till
stared
at
her
stonily
.
Paula
was
going
hot
and
cold
by
now
.
Had
it
been
stolen
?
No
,
she
remembered
her
bag
tipping
over
in
the
cloakroom
at
Mattli
-
it
must
have
fallen
out
then
.
But
without
it
she
could
not
pay
for
her
coffee
and
salad
.
"
Having
trouble
?
"
a
voice
beside
her
asked
.
"
Do
n't
worry
.
Let
me
.
"
Paula
turned
gratefully
,
then
gasped
with
surprise
as
she
recognised
the
slight
figure
in
black
roll-neck
sweater
and
skin
tight
pants
.
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
!
Gary
Oliver
!
What
are
you
doing
here
?
"
"
The
same
as
you
I
expect
,
Paula
-
getting
my
strength
up
to
face
the
rest
of
the
day
.
Let
me
pay
and
then
we
'll
have
lunch
together
and
do
some
catching
up
-
unless
you
're
meeting
someone
,
of
course
.
"
"
No
-
no
,
I
'm
not
.
"
Paula
picked
up
her
try
and
moved
aside
waiting
for
him
,
flushed
with
pleasure
at
seeing
a
familiar
face
.
Gary
Oliver
was
a
designer
,
young
and
very
talented
.
She
had
met
him
back
home
in
the
west
country
when
he
had
come
to
supervise
a
show
put
on
by
one
of
the
big
ready-to-wear
labels
,
Carnega
,
for
whom
he
worked
as
a
junior
member
of
the
design
team
.
For
a
whole
week
they
had
worked
closely
together
,
sharing
flasks
of
coffee
and
packets
of
cigarettes
and
Paula
had
grown
to
like
the
pixieish
little
man
who
by
his
very
nature
offered
her
no
challenge
-
and
no
threat
.
Gary
should
have
been
a
girl
,
she
had
thought
,
for
he
was
half
a
head
smaller
than
she
was
with
fair
curling
hair
,
baby-blue
eyes
and
long
thick
lashes
that
were
the
envy
of
every
woman
who
met
him
.
"
Shall
we
sit
over
there
in
the
corner
?
"
Gary
suggested
.
He
led
the
way
,
his
slim
hips
in
the
tight
fitting
pants
snaking
gracefully
between
the
tables
.
They
unloaded
their
trays
on
to
a
table
.
"
What
are
you
doing
in
London
then
,
Paula
?
Apart
from
mislaying
your
purse
,
I
mean
.
"
He
grinned
at
her
impishly
.
She
told
him
.
"
And
what
about
you
?
Are
n't
you
with
Carnega
any
more
?
"
He
shook
his
head
.
Dimples
played
in
his
cheeks
.
"
No
-
now
I
'm
with
the
House
of
Oliver
.
"
"
The
House
of
Oliver
-
?
Oh
!
"
she
squealed
as
light
dawned
.
"
Your
own
house
?
You
've
set
up
as
a
designer
in
your
own
right
,
Gary
!
"
"
Yep
.
In
a
small
way
at
the
moment
,
of
course
,
but
things
are
happening
.
I
came
into
a
bit
of
money
when
my
grandmother
died
and
I
decided
to
put
it
to
good
use
.
"
"
Is
n't
it
a
bit
of
a
risk
?
"
Paula
asked
.
He
shrugged
his
narrow
shoulders
.
"
Perhaps
.
But
I
wanted
to
work
for
myself
.
Designing
clothes
for
Carnega
was
all
very
well
and
I
made
a
good
living
at
it
I
wo
n't
deny
but
I
wanted
to
be
free
to
do
my
own
thing
-
and
to
have
my
own
name
on
the
labels
.
I
have
quite
a
few
contacts
-
people
who
knew
me
when
I
was
designing
for
Carnega
-
and
they
have
been
very
encouraging
.
So
I
have
decided
to
move
to
London
and
open
a
showroom
.
In
fact
I
have
just
been
looking
at
a
place
in
South
Audley
Street
,
not
far
from
Mattli
.
If
it
works
out
we
shall
practically
be
neighbours
,
Paula
.
"
"
What
a
small
world
!
I
had
no
idea
,
"
Paula
said
,
surprised
she
had
not
already
heard
the
news
.
Usually
the
slightest
whisper
travelled
like
jungle
drums
through
the
world
of
fashion
.
Until
now
Gary
had
been
an
out-of-town
designer
,
of
course
.
But
if
he
was
moving
to
London
his
new
fashion
house
would
soon
be
a
talking
point
.
"
We
must
keep
in
touch
,
"
Gary
said
as
he
finished
his
cheese
roll
.
"
Promise
you
'll
look
in
and
say
hello
when
you
have
time
.
"
"
I
will
.
Apart
from
anything
else
I
owe
you
a
coffee
.
"
"
True
.
I
do
n't
suppose
I
could
persuade
you
to
work
for
me
in
return
?
I
'm
looking
for
a
couple
of
good
models
.
Though
I
do
n't
suppose
I
could
afford
to
pay
you
as
well
as
Mattli
does
-
yet
.
Maybe
one
day
-
"
Paula
laughed
.
"
I
do
n't
earn
that
much
!
By
the
time
I
've
paid
for
my
room
at
the
YWCA
and
bought
all
the
make-up
and
clothes
I
need
there
never
seems
to
be
anything
left
over
.
I
'm
looking
for
a
rich
husband
to
take
me
away
from
it
all
.
"
"
And
I
'm
sure
one
day
you
'll
find
him
.
In
the
meantime
,
do
n't
forget
your
friends
,
eh
Paula
?
"
"
I
wo
n't
,
"
she
promised
,
glancing
at
her
watch
.
"
Oh
hell
,
I
shall
have
to
go
.
"
"
Me
too
.
But
it
was
great
to
see
you
again
,
Paula
.
"
They
walked
back
to
South
Audley
Street
together
,
weaving
their
way
through
the
lunchtime
crowds
on
the
pavements
,
the
tall
,
striking
girl
and
the
young
man
whose
pixieish
looks
belied
his
twenty-six
years
.
Outside
the
front
entrance
of
the
House
of
Mattli
Paula
turned
to
give
him
a
quick
impulsive
hug
.
"
Thanks
for
the
lunch
,
Gary
.
And
good
luck
with
your
new
venture
!
"
She
held
up
her
fingers
,
tightly
crossed
for
him
.
He
grinned
.
"
I
'll
need
it
.
Do
n't
forget
to
come
and
see
me
,
will
you
?
I
shall
be
expecting
you
.
"
"
I
wo
n't
forget
.
'Bye
for
now
!
"
she
called
,
and
ran
in
through
the
imposing
front
door
.
Madame
Mattli
was
furious
.
In
all
the
time
she
had
been
with
her
Paula
had
never
seen
her
so
angry
.
"
I
hear
you
have
been
seen
going
into
the
House
of
Oliver
,
"
she
said
,
her
immaculately
painted
lips
tight
with
fury
.
Beside
her
Monsieur
Mattli
,
a
small
Greek-looking
man
,
some
ten
years
her
senior
,
was
also
quivering
with
indignation
.
"
Not
once
but
several
times
,
"
he
added
.
It
was
so
unusual
for
him
to
contribute
anything
to
the
conversation
that
Paula
glanced
at
him
in
surprise
.
Though
he
was
always
in
evidence
it
was
invariably
Madame
who
did
all
the
talking
,
giving
orders
,
fussing
around
clients
,
so
that
Paula
was
never
quite
certain
what
his
role
was
.
"
Gary
Oliver
is
a
friend
,
"
she
said
defensively
.
Madame
Mattli
snorted
angrily
.
"
I
do
not
pay
you
to
have
friends
in
rival
fashion
houses
.
"
"
He
's
not
a
rival
-
"
Paula
broke
off
.
It
seemed
ridiculous
that
a
newcomer
like
Gary
could
be
any
threat
to
a
well-established
house
like
Mattli
.
But
in
the
cut-throat
world
of
fashion
up
and
coming
designers
were
to
be
feared
-
and
already
Gary
's
reputation
was
growing
.
"
You
know
that
we
insist
on
complete
loyalty
,
"
Madame
Mattli
continued
.
"
The
security
of
our
designs
is
paramount
.
Oh
Paula
,
how
could
you
!
"
"
But
I
would
never
mention
anything
I
have
seen
here
!
"
Paula
protested
.
Madame
snorted
again
.
"
How
can
I
be
sure
of
that
?
Even
if
you
do
not
intend
to
be
disloyal
there
is
always
the
risk
that
you
might
be
careless
.
Pillow
talk
is
the
most
dangerous
.
"
"
Pillow
talk
!
"
Paula
repeated
,
stunned
.
Close
though
her
friendship
with
Gary
had
become
she
had
never
once
breathed
a
word
to
him
about
the
new
collections
she
saw
taking
shape
at
Mattli
-
and
as
for
"
pillow
talk
"
the
notion
was
absurd
.
There
was
nothing
like
that
between
them
and
never
would
be
.
Gary
was
not
interested
in
girls
.
Surely
that
must
be
obvious
to
everyone
who
met
him
.
"
You
must
stop
visiting
him
,
"
Madame
said
firmly
.
"
Either
I
have
your
word
on
It
or
I
am
afraid
you
can
no
longer
remain
in
my
employ
.
I
want
you
to
promise
me
here
and
now
that
you
will
not
see
Gary
Oliver
again
.
"
Paula
was
trembling
.
Her
job
with
the
House
of
Mattli
was
her
life
.
But
to
allow
herself
to
be
dictated
to
in
this
way
when
she
knew
she
had
done
nothing
wrong
was
tantamount
to
admitting
guilt
.
And
she
could
n't
bear
the
thought
of
being
sucked
back
into
the
ebb
tide
of
loneliness
again
either
.
With
Gary
she
enjoyed
a
relationship
she
had
never
experienced
with
anyone
else
-
the
easy-going
friendship
of
a
male
who
made
no
demands
whatever
on
her
-
and
it
meant
more
to
her
than
she
had
realised
.
"
I
have
never
betrayed
any
confidence
and
I
never
will
.
But
you
ca
n't
expect
me
to
cut
myself
off
from
my
friends
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
am
afraid
I
do
expect
it
,
Paula
,
in
this
case
.
"
"
I
ca
n't
promise
not
to
see
Gary
again
.
"
"
Very
well
.
"
There
was
a
hint
of
sadness
now
in
Madame
's
eyes
but
her
mouth
was
set
and
determined
.
"
I
shall
be
sorry
to
lose
you
,
Paula
.
You
are
a
good
model
and
you
suited
me
very
well
.
But
you
leave
me
no
choice
.
Please
do
not
bother
to
come
in
again
.
I
shall
contact
the
agency
for
a
replacement
immediately
.
And
I
warn
you
,
if
any
of
my
designs
or
anything
like
them
turn
up
in
the
showroom
at
the
House
of
Oliver
I
shall
sue
-
and
win
the
sort
of
damages
that
will
put
your
little
friend
out
of
business
for
good
.
Do
I
make
myself
clear
?
"
Paula
was
still
afraid
of
Madame
Mattli
-
and
she
was
also
close
to
tears
.
But
she
was
determined
Madame
should
not
be
aware
of
either
.
"
Yes
,
Madame
.
I
'm
sorry
to
leave
you
,
but
I
assure
you
you
need
not
worry
on
that
score
.
"
The
showrooms
of
the
House
of
Oliver
were
smaller
and
less
grand
than
those
at
the
House
of
Mattli
but
the
decor
was
newer
and
fresher
,
pale
grey
drapes
,
ultra
modern
black
furniture
and
a
great
deal
of
gleaming
stainless
steel
.
Gary
was
in
the
workroom
when
Paula
arrived
,
pinning
a
length
of
vibrant
pink
chiffon
sarong-style
around
one
of
his
models
.
His
mouth
was
full
of
pins
.
"
What
are
you
doing
here
?
"
he
asked
without
moving
his
lips
.
Paula
perched
herself
against
the
cutting
table
trying
to
look
nonchalant
.
"
I
've
left
Mattli
,
"
she
said
.
Gary
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
,
pins
spewing
from
his
mouth
and
catching
on
the
front
of
his
black
jersey
.
Then
he
unpinned
the
length
of
chiffon
and
let
it
fall
to
the
floor
.
The
model
stood
motionless
,
clad
in
nothing
but
her
bra
and
stockings
,
waiting
for
his
instructions
.
"
We
'll
leave
this
for
now
,
Claudia
"
,
he
said
.
"
See
if
you
can
rustle
up
a
cup
of
tea
for
Paula
and
me
,
please
.
"
The
girl
pulled
on
her
wrap
and
moved
to
the
door
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
as
she
went
and
Paula
was
aware
of
the
hostility
in
her
gaze
.
Why
was
it
all
women
hated
her
so
,
even
when
they
did
n't
know
her
?
She
shrugged
.
Oh
well
,
she
should
be
used
to
it
by
now
-
Gary
got
up
,
took
Paula
by
the
arm
and
led
her
over
to
the
low
sofa
.
"
What
's
all
this
about
,
lovey
?
You
ca
n't
have
left
Mattli
.
"
"
I
have
.
"
Paula
related
what
had
happened
and
saw
Gary
turn
pale
.
"
Oh
Lord
!
You
mean
she
thinks
you
've
been
spying
for
me
!
If
she
sues
I
'll
be
ruined
.
Even
worse
,
someone
of
her
stature
could
make
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
trouble
for
me
,
even
if
she
does
n't
.
"
"
But
Gary
-
I
have
n't
been
spying
for
you
!
I
have
n't
even
mentioned
a
single
detail
of
the
Mattli
collection
.
"
"
You
know
that
and
so
do
I.
But
suppose
I
've
done
something
similar
?
It
happens
every
season
-
by
sheer
chance
and
law
of
averages
some
of
the
ideas
are
bound
to
come
up
.
There
are
always
accusations
of
piracy
and
copy-catting
,
though
they
ca
n't
usually
be
substantiated
.
But
if
she
can
prove
that
you
and
I
-
"
"
That
's
nonsense
!
We
have
n't
done
anything
wrong
.
"
Gary
ran
a
distracted
hand
through
his
mop
of
fair
hair
.
"
You
're
going
to
have
to
describe
the
Mattli
collection
to
me
.
Every
detail
.
"
"
Gary
!
"
she
objected
,
shocked
.
"
You
're
an
original
.
You
ca
n't
steal
their
ideas
!
"
"
No
,
idiot
-
not
so
that
I
can
steal
them
.
So
that
I
can
go
through
my
designs
and
make
quite
certain
that
there
is
not
one
collar
,
not
one
cuff
detail
,
not
the
slightest
influence
that
they
could
accuse
me
of
copying
from
them
.
Oh
Jesus
Christ
!
-
suppose
there
's
something
major
?
My
peg
top
evening
gown
-
my
beautiful
cerise
lace
-
I
could
end
up
having
to
rethink
the
whole
collection
!
"
"
For
goodness
sake
stop
panicking
!
"
Paula
said
,
though
she
could
feel
the
seeds
of
panic
herself
.
"
I
'm
sure
there
's
nothing
to
worry
about
.
"
"
I
only
hope
you
're
right
!
"
he
said
in
anguished
tones
.
The
model
came
in
with
the
cups
of
tea
,
still
glowering
darkly
at
Paula
from
beneath
her
fringe
of
false
eyelashes
.
It
was
clear
she
was
blaming
Paula
bitterly
for
the
interrupted
afternoon
and
her
boss
's
drastic
change
of
mood
.
"
That
girl
is
a
dog
!
"
Paula
said
when
they
were
alone
again
.
"
I
'm
sure
she
ca
n't
do
justice
to
your
designs
.
And
with
a
miserable
face
like
hers
I
'm
surprised
you
ever
get
any
work
done
at
all
.
"
Gary
looked
crestfallen
.
"
She
's
the
best
I
could
get
-
"
"
Oh
what
rubbish
!
"
Paula
said
roundly
.
"
Anyway
,
you
've
got
me
now
so
you
can
get
rid
of
her
.
"
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
Gary
asked
.
He
looked
like
a
worried
small
boy
.
"
I
told
you
-
I
've
left
Mattli
.
I
'll
come
and
work
for
you
.
"
"
Oh
Paula
!
"
Gary
's
expression
became
even
more
anxious
.
"
You
know
I
'd
give
my
right
arm
to
have
someone
as
good
as
you
to
model
for
me
!
But
I
told
you
before
-
I
could
n't
afford
to
pay
you
what
you
're
worth
.
Well
,
not
for
ages
,
anyway
.
It
's
going
to
be
a
long
struggle
getting
established
and
until
I
am
I
do
n't
see
how
-
"
Paula
smiled
.
For
the
first
time
she
felt
the
stirrings
of
something
like
power
.
It
was
not
unlike
the
feeling
she
experienced
when
men
looked
at
her
and
wanted
her
though
she
knew
it
could
not
be
that
for
there
was
nothing
sexual
between
her
and
Gary
and
never
would
be
.
But
it
was
just
as
exciting
,
nevertheless
.
It
made
her
feel
strong
,
invincible
almost
,
and
just
a
tiny
bit
as
if
she
had
drunk
too
much
wine
.
Her
smile
spread
.
The
restaurant
was
packed
,
Saturday
evenings
always
fully
booked
at
The
Magpie
,
the
best
eating
house
in
the
small
commuter
town
twenty-one
miles
north
of
London
.
The
six
people
at
a
corner
table
were
well
known
to
the
proprietor
,
who
saw
them
regularly
in
the
winter
months
.
Two
of
the
couples
were
obviously
married
,
and
in
their
early
fifties
,
but
sitting
at
opposite
ends
of
the
length
of
the
table
were
a
silver-haired
woman
still
showing
some
of
the
beauty
that
had
helped
make
her
a
famous
actress
in
the
forties
;
and
a
broad-shouldered
young
man
.
From
the
facial
resemblance
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
her
son
.
But
his
features
were
carved
from
stronger
stuff
,
the
mouth
wider
beneath
a
nose
that
was
broken
though
still
straight
.
His
jaw
was
thrusting
enough
if
not
thick
set
,
with
dark
hair
that
was
short
and
wavy
,
with
a
touch
of
premature
grey
at
the
temples
.
The
only
thing
entirely
common
to
both
was
the
good-natured
warmth
of
their
brown
eyes
and
the
crinkles
in
the
skin
at
the
corners
,
especially
when
they
laughed
.
The
candlelight
reflected
on
his
gold
wristwatch
as
he
held
a
lighter
to
the
cigarette
of
one
of
the
women
.
His
Chester
Barrie
suit
was
cut
in
grey
flannel
,
the
blue
silk
handkerchief
flowing
from
his
breast
pocket
matching
his
shirt
and
tie
.
The
people
were
all
obviously
successful
,
a
scene
duplicated
at
all
the
tables
of
The
Magpie
:
success
in
the
City
,
in
Whitehall
,
in
the
Ivory
Towers
of
the
great
teaching
hospitals
,
and
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
But
whereas
the
faces
all
around
were
pale
,
or
a
smooth
golden
bronze
from
holidays
chasing
the
winter
sun
,
his
was
ruddy
,
weathered
,
the
creases
radiating
from
the
eyes
suggesting
a
life
soaking
up
the
glare
of
the
sun
and
wind
.
It
was
a
face
out
of
place
in
the
room
of
suburban
dwellers
.
The
woman
pulled
on
her
cigarette
,
then
blew
the
smoke
away
straight
up
into
the
air
with
an
exaggerated
abandonment
.
The
man
said
something
and
they
all
laughed
,
the
woman
giving
him
a
mock
slap
on
the
arm
.
It
was
a
relaxed
,
happy
birthday
party
with
his
mother
and
family
friends
,
for
John
Delaney
was
now
thirty-three
years
of
age
.
The
were
about
to
select
from
the
sweet
trolley
when
,
at
a
nod
from
his
mother
,
the
proprietor
dimmed
the
houselights
and
a
young
waitress
brought
in
a
surprise
birthday
cake
,
the
reflection
from
the
candles
throwing
her
face
into
warm
relief
.
They
all
sang
Happy
Birthday
.
John
Delaney
pretended
to
back
away
.
"
My
God
!
"
he
quipped
,
"
it
's
a
blazing
inferno
.
"
"
Do
n't
forget
to
make
a
wish
,
John
,
"
his
mother
called
out
.
With
lots
of
good-natured
bantering
,
Delaney
blew
them
out
.
The
proprietor
took
over
,
and
was
still
serving
the
portions
when
one
of
the
waitresses
came
in
and
whispered
something
to
Delaney
.
He
frowned
,
pulled
the
napkin
from
his
lap
and
laid
it
on
the
table
as
he
stood
up
,
shrugging
apologetically
to
his
mother
,
seeming
to
indicate
that
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
had
happened
before
,
from
time
to
time
.
Was
he
a
doctor
or
a
QC
used
to
sudden
,
unsocial
calls
?
But
the
look
on
Vanessa
Delaney
's
face
as
she
watched
her
son
edge
his
way
through
the
tables
was
tinged
with
something
that
had
no
place
in
such
a
mundane
event
.
Something
she
could
not
disguise
.
Fear
.
He
had
been
called
like
this
only
three
times
before
-
to
her
knowledge
.
That
was
when
he
had
been
in
the
SAS
.
Once
,
for
something
in
Ulster
.
Once
for
something
she
had
never
found
out
about
.
And
then
the
last
time
;
that
had
turned
out
to
be
a
walk
on
the
wild
side
.
In
Argentina
.
Eugene
Forster
was
in
his
bath
,
drawing
contentedly
on
a
cigar
,
tumbler
of
whisky
and
water
held
in
his
hand
,
arm
laid
languidly
along
the
tiled
border
.
His
eyes
were
closed
as
he
perceived
pleasure
from
all
of
his
senses
,
except
that
of
sight
.
The
whisky
.
The
richness
of
the
Havana
leaf
.
And
the
sound
of
Beethoven
's
Second
Romance
for
violin
and
orchestra
,
coming
from
the
stereo
speaker
in
his
bedroom
.
And
the
sense
of
t
ouch
.
Not
only
from
the
luxurious
,
all-enveloping
warmth
of
the
soapy
water
,
but
from
the
hands
lightly
moving
across
his
chest
,
the
fingers
caressing
the
dark
hair
.
The
hands
moved
away
,
downwards
,
across
the
hard
muscle
of
his
stomach
that
was
as
tough
and
flat
as
it
had
been
ten
years
ago
,
when
he
was
eighteen
.
Forster
's
eyes
opened
.
They
were
hard
pin-points
of
slate
blue
beneath
bushy
eyebrows
.
His
hair
was
long
and
thick
,
his
large
nose
aquiline
.
With
a
splash
his
hand
left
the
whisky
and
found
that
of
the
intruder
,
arresting
it
in
a
grip
that
made
the
girl
in
the
bath
beside
him
wince
.
"
Hey
,
Gene
,
"
she
cried
out
,
"
that
hurts
.
"
Forster
grinned
,
exposing
teeth
tipped
with
gold
.
Before
he
could
say
anything
,
the
telephone
on
the
Grecian
plinth
nearest
to
the
girl
gave
a
muted
double
purr
.
The
girl
picked
up
the
receiver
,
soap
suds
streaming
on
to
its
cover
.
"
Hello
,
"
she
said
,
and
listened
.
Bewildered
,
she
held
it
out
to
him
.
"
It
's
somebody
or
something
called
G9
.
"
Eugene
Forster
paused
,
raised
one
of
his
bushy
eyebrows
,
then
slowly
and
deliberately
,
with
the
wisdom
of
previous
experience
,
finished
the
whisky
,
drew
one
last
time
on
the
cigar
then
plunged
it
with
a
hiss
into
the
water
,
before
he
took
the
"
phone
.
Doctor
Anderson
was
busy
in
Casualty
,
just
completing
the
suturing
of
a
six-inch
gash
in
the
arm
of
a
policeman
,
when
the
bleeper
in
the
top
pocket
of
the
white
clinical
coat
emitted
a
plaintive
call
.
The
doctor
switched
it
off
and
carried
on
with
the
work
in
hand
.
It
was
some
eight
minutes
later
before
the
"
phone
in
Sister
's
office
was
used
.
Almost
immediately
the
discarded
white
coat
lay
beside
the
startled
Sister
,
who
was
left
to
call
the
Duty
Registrar
.
Shocked
,
she
stared
disbelievingly
at
the
receding
back
of
Doctor
Anderson
,
and
wondered
what
had
been
contained
in
the
message
that
had
made
a
member
of
the
staff
drop
everything
in
such
an
unprofessional
way
.
The
public
bar
of
The
East
Indiaman
was
full
,
the
atmosphere
thick
with
cigarette
smoke
,
the
noise
incredible
.
Over
in
the
corner
of
the
sizable
room
an
electronic
organ
was
giving
out
Moon
River
,
the
player
a
young
,
prematurely
bald
man
,
with
sweat
standing
out
on
the
smooth
,
polished
face
and
head
.
He
wore
an
open-necked
checked
shirt
,
and
jeans
,
and
occasionally
reached
for
the
pint
of
lager
at
his
side
.
The
crowd
of
cockneys
were
singing
along
,
rocking
from
side
to
side
,
men
with
arms
around
their
wives
and
girl
friends
,
tables
stacked
with
glasses
and
bottles
and
littered
with
ashtrays
and
empty
crisp
packets
.
When
the
dark
blue
uniforms
of
a
sergeant
and
constable
appeared
in
the
doorway
,
they
stood
out
like
sore
thumbs
,
causing
more
than
a
ripple
of
interest
from
the
somewhat
less
than
friendly
clientele
.
Edging
their
way
through
the
densely-packed
throng
they
finally
reached
the
organist
who
carried
on
playing
,
at
the
same
time
bending
down
an
ear
in
the
sergeant
's
direction
.
The
conversation
was
brief
.
In
mid-tune
,
the
organist
stopped
,
grabbed
his
jacket
,
and
surrounded
by
the
two
policemen
,
began
to
leave
.
"
Leave
him
alone
,
"
someone
yelled
,
"
and
go
and
arrest
one
of
those
geezers
who
live
up
in
Hampstead
.
"
Somebody
jostled
the
sergeant
's
arm
.
He
turned
,
and
pushed
the
man
away
.
And
then
it
exploded
into
a
riot
.
In
seconds
,
the
police
officers
'
hats
were
dislodged
from
their
owners
'
heads
,
and
they
disappeared
into
a
boiling
fighting
,
mass
of
humanity
.
Glasses
were
smashed
and
chairs
were
broken
.
A
wall
mirror
was
cracked
.
The
electronic
organ
was
over-turned
in
the
melee
.
And
women
screamed
.
The
young
man
,
Martin
Grant
,
struggling
through
the
throng
,
managed
to
get
to
the
door
when
the
sirens
and
the
flashing
blue
lights
outside
the
window
heralded
the
arrival
of
uniformed
reinforcements
.
As
he
made
to
leave
,
the
young
man
was
confronted
by
another
sergeant
,
with
a
night
stick
.
"
Oh
,
no
you
do
n't
,
sonny
.
Back
inside
.
"
Martin
Grant
started
to
say
something
but
received
a
jab
in
the
stomach
,
from
the
night
stick
.
The
sergeant
pushed
forward
,
then
remembered
nothing
more
until
he
regained
consciousness
in
an
ambulance
,
one
of
several
taking
a
selection
of
minor
injuries
to
hospital
.
But
the
prematurely
bald
young
man
was
not
among
them
.
Clint
Eastwood
struck
a
match
,
held
it
in
cupped
hands
,
and
bent
his
grizzled
and
unshaven
face
down
,
applying
the
cheroot
to
the
flame
.
But
his
eyes
never
left
the
four
men
before
him
.
A
shoot-out
was
inevitable
,
the
result
foregone
.
And
then
a
jumble
of
words
flashed
across
his
face
,
causing
cat-calls
and
boos
in
the
half-empty
cinema
.
URGENT
MESSAGE
FOR
MR
BARRY
SILK
AT
THE
MANAGER
'S
OFFICE
.
It
was
still
there
as
the
guns
blazed
.
Only
when
the
last
bullet
had
been
fired
and
when
Clint
Eastwood
had
matter-of-factly
and
deftly
dropped
the
six-shooter
back
into
its
holster
,
flicked
the
cheroot
away
and
walked
into
the
sunset
,
did
the
man
in
the
old
jacket
and
cords
,
legs
dangling
over
the
seat
in
front
,
get
up
and
shamble
slowly
up
the
darkened
aisle
.
In
the
bright
lights
of
the
foyer
his
face
was
clearly
illuminated
.
It
was
pock-marked
.
With
his
unkempt
ginger
hair
running
down
into
sideboards
it
made
his
hard
face
look
even
meaner
.
In
his
left
ear
he
wore
a
small
ring
.
In
a
Northern
Ireland
accent
he
asked
for
the
manager
's
office
.
Authoritatively
,
he
snapped
his
surname
into
the
"
phone
,
listened
for
a
second
or
two
,
then
replaced
the
receiver
on
to
its
cradle
.
Nodding
at
the
manager
he
left
the
office
without
a
further
word
.
Barry
Silk
had
killed
more
terrorists
and
a
few
other
criminals
in
his
old
hometown
of
Belfast
than
anybody
,
and
that
included
IRA
,
Loyalists
-
even
the
British
Army
-
would
ever
know
.
For
he
just
liked
to
kill
.
The
telephone
did
n't
ring
in
Theodore
Lawton
's
house
.
Despite
official
strictures
that
everybody
had
to
have
one
,
there
was
no
line
to
his
converted
nissen-hut
home
on
Dartmoor
.
If
contact
was
necessary
this
was
done
by
radio
.
He
was
a
tall
,
angular
man
in
his
early
forties
,
with
dark
receding
hair
brushed
straight
back
.
Lawton
removed
his
glasses
,
grabbed
his
jacket
,
and
followed
James
De
Vere
Green
,
the
friend
with
whom
he
shared
the
small-holding
together
with
an
assortment
of
dogs
,
four
horses
,
chickens
and
a
couple
of
pigs
,
out
of
the
door
.
He
made
his
way
to
the
old
barn
on
the
corner
of
their
three
acres
.
Together
they
pulled
back
the
high
door
,
which
despite
its
rustic
appearance
,
ran
smoothly
on
well-greased
and
balanced
rollers
.
The
heavy
duty
generators
,
ex-Army
mobile
field
units
,
roared
into
life
when
Lawton
cranked
the
handle
.
When
they
were
switched
on
the
lights
flooded
out
across
the
bare
,
flat
expanse
of
moorland
just
beyond
the
perimeter
of
their
property
.
De
Vere
Green
was
already
up
in
the
seat
of
the
converted
Sno-cat
that
they
used
as
a
tractor
,
its
caterpillar
track
ideal
for
use
in
the
harsh
Dartmoor
winters
.
But
now
he
was
using
it
to
draw
out
their
other
piece
of
essential
winter
equipment
.
It
,
too
,
had
been
bought
ex-Services
.
The
barn
served
as
a
hanger
for
their
Gazelle
helicopter
,
which
now
stood
illuminated
by
the
floodlights
on
the
roof
,
its
belly
reflecting
the
landing
lights
set
in
cement
housings
.
The
helicopter
was
already
fuelled
and
ready
to
go
.
The
two
men
went
about
readying
for
flight
,
with
practised
,
unspoken
efficiency
.
Twenty
minutes
after
the
first
radio
signal
,
Lawton
finished
his
pre-flight
checks
.
With
a
piercing
whine
and
a
cough
,
the
engine
caught
on
the
first
ignition
.
The
rotor
blades
began
their
increasing
chop
as
De
Vere
Green
ran
in
under
them
and
shook
hands
,
just
the
once
,
with
Lawton
.
"
Keep
your
head
down
!
"
This
was
their
time-honoured
good
luck
ritual
.
He
stood
at
the
barn
door
and
watched
the
Gazelle
finally
lift
off
,
its
own
lights
rising
up
to
slowly
mingle
with
the
stars
.
Of
those
left
behind
,
none
more
than
he
knew
the
awesome
dangers
implicit
in
the
recall
signal
from
G9
.
The
destination
of
John
Delaney
was
a
room
in
the
subterranean
complex
beneath
the
square
,
featureless
block
that
was
the
Ministry
of
Defence
,
in
Whitehall
.
His
car
,
led
by
a
police
escort
,
swung
in
past
the
craggy
statue
of
Field
Marshal
Montgomery
.
Cleared
with
the
security
guards
at
the
desk
he
went
into
the
lift
that
would
take
him
down
to
a
depth
below
the
level
of
the
Thames
.
The
area
he
was
entering
was
guarded
by
an
advanced
intruder
detection
system
which
included
thermal
sensors
,
vibration
detectors
and
infra-red
closed
circuit
television
,
all
integrated
into
a
computer
system
.
As
soon
as
he
stepped
out
into
the
fluorescent-lit
corridor
,
he
was
met
by
an
official
who
hurried
him
into
a
briefing
room
.
An
air
of
emergency
was
reflected
in
the
men
busy
at
the
large
illuminated
translucent
plot
that
dominated
the
end
of
the
room
,
at
the
messengers
disappearing
through
doors
and
at
telephones
giving
out
their
muted
urgent
calls
.
Several
men
,
navy
with
gold
braid
in
evidence
,
turned
towards
him
as
Delaney
walked
over
,
eyes
automatically
glancing
at
the
geography
and
configurations
on
the
plastic
:
Atlantic
,
beyond
the
equator
.
"
Ah
,
John
.
"
The
tight-lipped
,
sandy-haired
man
holding
out
his
hand
was
well
known
to
Delaney
.
William
Connors
had
briefed
him
many
times
in
the
past
,
yet
Delaney
even
now
,
was
unsure
of
just
where
Connors
fitted
into
the
scheme
of
things
.
But
he
accepted
it
was
all
part
of
the
deliberate
fuzzing
that
went
with
G9
.
Delaney
shook
Connors
by
the
hand
.
"
What
have
we
got
?
"
"
Come
over
here
.
"
Connors
led
him
away
from
the
others
.
Mystified
,
Delaney
,
still
trying
to
take
in
more
details
of
the
map
,
followed
.
He
waited
as
,
unusually
,
Connors
seemed
to
experience
difficulty
in
putting
the
words
he
wanted
together
.
"
It
's
a
thirty
thousand
tonne
container
ship
.
One
of
ours
.
Something
funny
's
happened
.
Had
a
weird
,
rambling
emergency
call
from
the
radio
operator
.
Then
absolute
silence
.
Not
a
peep
from
her
since
.
"
Connors
paused
momentarily
and
looked
straight
at
Delaney
,
before
he
continued
.
"
She
's
dead
in
the
water
,
and
out
of
range
of
our
conventional
rescue
forces
.
We
want
you
there
to
check
out
what
the
hell
has
happened
.
And
secondly
,
we
want
you
to
stop
anybody
boarding
her
under
pretext
of
rescue
-
or
salvage
.
"
Delaney
raised
a
critical
eyebrow
:
His
one
question
went
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
,
since
he
could
think
of
no
other
reason
for
the
involvement
of
G9
.
"
Cargo
?
"
Connors
'
lips
tightened
even
further
as
he
nodded
.
"
Exactly
,
but
I
'm
afraid
it
's
on
a
need
to
know
basis
.
And
it
's
been
decided
G9
do
not
need
to
know
.
Nor
for
that
matter
do
I.
"
Delaney
,
searching
in
his
pocket
for
his
pipe
,
shrugged
.
That
sort
of
thing
was
n't
unusual
.
It
helped
if
you
got
caught
to
know
as
little
as
possible
.
"
Unfortunately
,
the
nearest
surface
units
are
elements
of
the
Red
Navy
,
"
Connors
continued
,
"
and
to
complicate
matters
they
've
got
a
sub
even
closer
,
capable
of
reaching
the
area
sometime
after
dawn
.
We
know
it
's
already
heading
that
way
.
Apart
from
our
Nimrods
,
there
has
been
at
least
one
overflight
by
a
Tupolev
.
"
He
gestured
towards
the
situation
map
,
almost
apologetically
.
"
Nasty
one
.
Maritime
job
.
Desperate
rush
.
Going
in
at
night
.
But
we
want
you
in
there
fast
!
"
Delaney
was
puzzled
.
"
Why
G9
?
"
he
asked
.
"
If
you
need
an
instant
military
presence
,
why
not
the
marines
?
The
SBS
would
love
this
one
.
"
Connors
shook
his
head
.
"
It
's
not
that
simple
.
The
ship
's
not
publicly
connected
with
us
.
In
fact
,
it
's
flying
a
flag
of
convenience
.
"
"
I
see
.
"
Delaney
sucked
thoughtfully
on
his
empty
pipe
.
G9
was
designated
civilian
-
on
its
own
if
anything
went
wrong
.
They
were
used
to
clean
up
any
unpleasant
incidents
from
which
HM
Government
needed
to
distance
itself
.
And
the
Americans
.
It
was
funded
jointly
.
"
Maybe
it
's
already
crawling
with
Reds
.
Too
many
for
us
.
What
do
we
do
then
?
"
Connors
gave
a
sympathetic
shrug
;
but
it
was
a
steely
look
.
"
Simply
blow
it
out
of
the
water
,
"
he
said
.
Delaney
's
eyebrows
shot
upwards
.
"
And
us
with
it
?
"
A
ghost
of
a
smile
,
without
humour
,
flitted
over
Connors
'
face
as
he
slapped
Delaney
on
the
back
.
"
You
people
know
how
to
survive
.
And
it
will
only
be
forty-eight
hours
before
relief
arrives
.
"
His
face
clouded
.
"
Whatever
has
happened
to
that
ship
-
Titron
-
it
's
weird
.
The
Nimrods
have
gone
in
low
,
and
taken
photographs
before
dusk
.
Here
,
take
a
look
.
"
Connors
splayed
out
some
large
black
and
whites
on
a
side
bench
.
Delaney
bent
over
them
,
adjusting
a
lamp
and
using
a
magnifying
glass
.
"
Not
a
sign
of
anybody
on
the
deck
.
Through
the
wheelhouse
windows
-
nothing
.
The
lifeboats
are
intact
,
and
on
their
davits
.
"
Delaney
found
himself
looking
at
a
cargo
vessel
with
a
very
high
superstructure
three-quarters
aft
.
Each
side
of
the
funnel
was
a
lifeboat
,
and
at
the
stern
was
a
stores
davit
and
capstan
.
Running
forward
were
a
series
of
derricks
.
The
bow
was
bulbous
.
There
was
no
sign
of
life
on
the
deck
between
the
stacked
containers
.
She
looked
enormous
.
He
examined
several
photographs
in
shades
of
green
,
obviously
taken
after
nightfall
with
a
light
intensifying
lens
.
The
greenish
hue
added
to
the
mystery
,
making
Titron
look
like
a
ghost
ship
.
Delaney
lowered
the
last
photograph
.
"
Bigger
than
I
thought
.
"
Connors
lit
a
cigarette
and
nodded
as
he
inhaled
the
smoke
.
"
She
's
got
a
capacity
for
two
thousand
three
hundred
containers
,
and
is
almost
as
long
as
the
QE2
.
"
"
Maybe
the
crew
are
being
kept
prisoners
,
"
Delaney
offered
,
straightening
up
.
"
Nobody
allowed
on
the
decks
.
"
Connors
looked
at
him
intently
through
the
smoke
haze
as
he
reached
out
and
switched
on
a
tape
recorder
.
There
was
a
hissing
.
The
voice
was
weak
,
and
barely
audible
.
"
-
MV
Titron
-
repeat
Titron
.
We
are
experiencing
difficulty
-
"
The
hissing
returned
,
stronger
this
time
,
drowning
everything
out
.
When
it
faded
again
the
voice
was
garbled
,
rising
hysterically
.
"
-
the
stars
are
getting
bigger
-
pulsating
-
and
the
sea
-
it
's
beginning
to
boil
-
"
The
voice
became
high-pitched
,
crazed
with
fear
.
"
-
the
sky
's
turning
green
.
Everything
's
changing
-
the
ship
-
"
Background
noises
,
like
screaming
,
welled
up
,
as
did
the
hissing
interference
.
When
it
faded
once
again
there
was
nothing
.
Connors
,
whose
intense
gaze
never
left
Delaney
,
switched
the
machine
off
.
"
That
's
all
.
"
Somewhere
in
the
silence
between
them
a
telephone
began
its
urgent
,
persistent
ring
.
It
served
to
stimulate
Connors
.
"
There
's
one
other
thing
you
should
know
.
The
Soviets
have
got
some
sort
of
space
experiment
going
on
.
Not
the
usual
thing
.
Telemetry
data
and
photographs
are
still
being
analysed
by
US
intelligence
agencies
,
but
it
may
be
their
much-vaunted
fighter
spacecraft
.
The
point
is
,
they
have
got
a
kind
of
recovery
fleet
out
,
about
two
hundred
miles
from
Titron
.
One
of
the
ships
is
the
Gargarin
.
"
When
Delaney
continued
to
look
blank
,
Connors
explained
.
"
Weird
looking
top-heavy
craft
with
four
huge
radar
dishes
and
a
massive
navigation
b
ridge
.
"
"
Let's
get
this
straight
,
"
Delaney
said
,
perplexed
.
"
Are
you
suggesting
there
is
any
connection
between
the
Soviet
space
shot
and
what
has
happened
to
Titron
?
"
Connors
took
his
time
to
answer
.
"
My
guess
is
no
.
There
is
a
mystery
,
but
I
do
n't
think
Ivan
is
behind
it
-
at
least
,
not
deliberately
.
"
Delaney
looked
at
Connors
,
searchingly
.
"
Accidentally
?
"
Connors
shrugged
,
and
turned
his
attention
back
to
the
tape
recorder
.
"
Want
to
hear
it
again
?
"
Delaney
nodded
.
When
it
came
to
an
end
,
Delaney
shook
his
head
.
"
The
man
sounds
crazed
-
mad
.
That
bit
about
the
sea
boiling
-
what
do
the
met
people
have
to
say
?
"
"
Come
and
hear
for
yourself
,
"
Connors
said
,
pointing
across
the
room
.
The
meteorologist
's
briefing
on
the
weather
in
the
operational
zone
for
the
previous
twenty-four
hours
left
no
possibility
of
hurricane
force
winds
.
"
At
no
time
were
the
wind
speeds
anything
but
light
,
"
the
meteorologist
confirmed
,
as
he
lowered
his
clip-board
.
"
I
can
guarantee
that
sea
conditions
were
calm
.
However
-
"
He
looked
apologetic.
"
-
since
nightfall
,
the
wind
has
backed
around
to
the
south
,
with
sea
swells
of
some
ten
to
fifteen
feet
.
Gales
of
force
eight
gusting
to
storm
force
ten
can
be
expected
in
the
area
well
after
dawn
.
"
Delaney
transposed
the
ten
to
fifteen
feet
into
a
visual
image
of
the
wave
motion
down
the
side
of
the
hull
.
In
less
than
six
hours
'
time
-
and
there
it
would
still
be
night
-
he
would
be
attempting
to
scale
the
steel
wall
,
trying
not
to
get
crushed
against
it
.
"
What
about
that
bit
in
the
tape
?
"
He
glanced
at
Connors
to
ensure
that
the
met
man
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
-
Connors
nodded
.
"
About
the
sky
turning
green
.
Any
possible
meteorological
explanation
?
"
The
met
man
removed
his
glasses
and
,
with
his
white
handkerchief
,
commenced
to
polish
them
vigorously
,
considering
the
question
for
a
moment
.
"
There
are
,
of
course
,
all
possible
reasons
for
lights
in
the
night
sky
,
the
aurora
borealis
being
the
most
famous
.
There
are
fireballs
and
electrical
storms
,
or
some
sort
of
celestial
display
.
Meteors
-
or
something
.
"
He
shook
his
head
.
"
Frankly
,
I
do
n't
think
so
.
"
Delaney
persisted
.
"
Electrical
storms
.
Do
you
think
that
could
be
the
interference
on
the
radio
transmission
?
"
The
met
man
was
adamant
.
"
Definitely
not
.
It
would
have
to
have
been
one
hell
of
a
continuous
storm
,
and
there
is
nothing
in
my
readings
,
satellite
scan
or
computer
print-out
,
to
suggest
that
.
"
Thanking
him
,
Delaney
and
Connors
walked
over
to
the
main
plot
.
"
Do
the
radio
people
think
it
was
deliberate
jamming
?
"
Delaney
asked
.
Connors
shook
his
head
.
"
Just
could
n't
say
with
any
certainty
.
"
When
they
reached
the
plot
,
a
man
wearing
earphones
turned
to
Connors
,
slipped
off
the
headset
,
allowing
it
to
rest
around
his
neck
.
"
Received
a
report
from
the
Nimrod
.
Overflight
by
a
Tupolev
took
place
again
just
after
nightfall
.
They
were
n't
absolutely
sure
,
but
for
a
while
afterwards
they
appeared
to
have
a
small
surface
radar
contact
one
nautical
mile
east
of
Titron
.
Then
it
just
disappeared
.
"
Connors
and
Delaney
eyed
each
other
.
"
You
thinking
the
way
I
am
?
"
Grimly
Delaney
slipped
the
pipe
back
into
his
pocket
and
nodded
.
"
They
've
had
a
go
at
getting
on
her
.
"
The
C130
Hercules
of
RAF
Transport
Command
,
markings
hurriedly
painted
out
,
stood
near
the
end
of
the
runway
,
its
engines
running
up
as
a
car
swung
in
through
the
raised
barrier
,
and
past
the
RAF
Regiment
guard
.
It
drove
swiftly
round
the
perimeter
and
pulled
in
behind
the
"
plane
,
its
ramp
down
,
cavernous
interior
gaping
wide
.
In
the
dimly-lit
interior
,
Delaney
could
see
crew
members
moving
around
,
and
the
bulky
outline
of
some
pieces
of
equipment
,
inflatable
dinghy
packs
and
harness
.
And
some
of
those
shadowy
figures
were
men
of
his
group
.
Three
had
come
to
G9
via
the
SAS
.
Two
from
the
Marines
equivalent
,
the
Special
Boat
Service
.
Anderson
was
unique
,
brought
in
to
fill
two
vital
functions
:
the
need
for
a
medic
,
and
the
need
to
give
G9
something
special
,
some
angle
that
would
disguise
its
true
nature
,
an
extraordinary
elite
fighting
group
trained
for
any
emergency
.
Each
of
them
for
their
own
private
reason
needed
to
live
with
death
at
their
shoulder
.
Delaney
had
,
since
his
young
wife
,
Pam
,
who
always
worried
stiff
at
his
parachuting
,
had
died
underneath
a
juggernaut
,
with
the
son
she
would
have
given
life
to
in
one
month
's
time
.
He
stepped
from
the
car
and
turned
to
slam
the
door
.
Connors
nodded
,
his
voice
lost
in
the
noise
from
the
Hercules
.
"
Good
luck
"
were
the
words
his
lips
formed
.
But
Delaney
,
fleetingly
,
as
he
slammed
the
door
,
saw
something
in
Connors
'
eyes
.
Guilt
?
Had
Connors
told
him
everything
?
Or
was
he
holding
something
back
?
The
car
gunned
away
.
Delaney
stood
for
a
second
looking
after
it
.
Then
he
shrugged
,
and
made
his
way
towards
the
aircraft
.
The
piercing
whine
of
the
C130
's
four
Allison
turbo
props
rose
even
higher
,
hurting
his
ears
,
the
air
stinking
with
the
smell
of
burnt
kerosene
,
the
hot
moist
gases
buffeting
and
pulling
at
his
clothes
.
He
ran
up
the
ramp
,
the
sergeant
liftmaster
activating
the
hydraulics
even
before
he
had
set
loot
on
it
.
Delaney
stood
,
watching
the
hatch
close
up
,
with
the
last
view
of
the
car
headlights
turning
away
towards
the
main
building
and
the
control
tower
.
As
soon
as
the
hull
was
sealed
,
the
liftmaster
spoke
into
his
intercom
.
Immediately
the
engine
noise
grew
even
louder
,
drowning
out
the
sound
of
Delaney
's
own
voice
as
he
shouted
an
acknowledgement
to
the
sergeant
and
settled
down
in
the
nearest
side
seat
,
strapping
himself
in
.
The
fuselage
vibrated
,
the
interior
lights
flickered
and
dimmed
;
and
then
with
a
lurch
they
began
to
roll
,
bumping
and
jarring
on
the
sectional
concrete
.
Half
a
minute
later
the
airframe
gave
one
final
creak
and
his
stomach
fell
away
as
the
Hercules
lifted
off
,
whining
into
the
night
sky
.
It
finally
came
home
then
to
Delaney
what
they
were
about
to
do
in
several
hours
'
time
.
The
last
occasion
he
had
parachuted
into
the
sea
,
at
night
,
operationally
,
had
been
off
South
Georgia
.
As
the
floor
levelled
off
the
lights
flickered
and
came
up
,
the
engine
noise
settling
down
to
a
steady
background
roar
.
Delaney
unbuckled
his
webbing
and
stood
up
,
picking
his
way
forward
past
the
life
rafts
racked
ready
for
the
drop
.
Up
in
the
forward
end
,
behind
the
bulkhead
,
sat
the
five
other
members
of
G9
,
already
dressed
in
thick
Navy
issue
pullovers
and
fatigues
.
Theodore
Lawton
,
leader
of
the
second
stick
of
three
,
greeted
Delaney
matter-of-factly
.
"
Good
evening
,
John
.
"
Delaney
shook
Lawton
by
the
hand
,
and
nodded
at
the
other
faces
,
regarding
them
levelly
.
Eugene
Forster
had
a
quizzical
smile
playing
around
his
mouth
.
Barry
Silk
was
eager
and
expectant
.
Martin
Grant
,
absolutely
placid
.
Only
Doctor
Anderson
looked
grim
,
face
drawn
and
pale
.
Delaney
settled
down
beside
Lawton
.
"
All
the
equipment
aboard
?
No
hitches
?
"
Lawton
nodded
.
He
had
been
in
radio
contact
with
Delaney
during
the
latter
's
journey
down
from
the
MOD
to
Brize
Norton
.
They
all
knew
that
it
was
a
night
drop
into
the
ocean
.
Nothing
more
.
He
began
to
brief
them
.
Silk
looked
disappointed
and
scratched
away
at
his
pock-marked
face
.
"
No
sign
of
life
,
you
say
?
"
Delaney
shook
his
head
,
knowing
that
for
Silk
nothing
alive
meant
nothing
to
kill
.
Eugene
Forster
lit
a
cheroot
.
"
Our
very
own
Marie
Celeste
,
eh
?
Interesting
.
"
"
It
's
a
holding
operation
,
"
Delaney
summed
up
briskly
,
"
more
than
anything
.
All
we
have
to
do
is
get
in
and
establish
a
bridgehead
,
so
to
speak
.
The
only
one
of
us
who
might
have
their
work
cut
out
is
Doctor
Anderson
-
if
we
find
a
lot
of
casualties
.
"
All
faces
turned
towards
the
doctor
.
Not
for
the
first
time
Delaney
looked
into
the
eyes
that
were
deep
,
infathomable
pools
of
green
,
and
at
the
copper-coloured
hair
falling
around
the
high
smooth
cheek
bones
;
at
the
small
upturned
nose
and
a
mouth
just
large
enough
to
hint
at
the
animal
sensuality
lying
dormant
beneath
the
surface
.
Dormant
?
Now
why
had
he
thought
of
that
?
The
doctor
,
when
he
had
first
seen
her
,
had
awakened
a
creature
deep
within
him
that
he
had
thought
would
sleep
for
ever
-
until
the
day
he
died
.
Its
movement
had
left
an
ache
in
his
heart
.
Maybe
the
anaesthetic
that
had
numbed
his
natural
instinct
to
a
beautiful
woman
since
Pam
's
death
was
wearing
off
.
Delaney
felt
irritated
.
"
There
's
one
other
thing
,
"
he
said
.
"
You
all
know
the
difficulties
inherent
in
getting
on
board
Titron
.
We
have
reason
to
believe
an
attempt
has
already
been
made
,
by
the
Russians
.
How
successful
they
were
we
have
no
idea
.
"
Barry
Silk
perked
up
.
"
We
take
them
out
if
they
are
aboard
,
right
?
No
holds
barred
,
and
no
shit
about
international
diplomatic
pressure
?
"
Delaney
agreed
.
"
No
flack
,
"
he
said
and
clapped
his
hands
together
,
rubbing
them
in
a
warming
motion
.
"
There
are
several
hours
to
go
.
We
've
got
an
in-flight
refuelling
schedule
before
the
drop
,
so
check
your
equipment
.
Then
get
some
rest
.
"
Delaney
tried
to
avoid
looking
at
Doctor
Nell
Anderson
as
he
went
forward
to
the
flight
deck
.
But
it
was
useless
.
He
could
not
get
over
the
fact
that
the
only
woman
who
had
come
through
the
near-impossible
screening
,
then
training
,
had
not
been
some
six
foot
Amazon
with
a
face
like
Atilla
the
Hun
-
but
a
petite
,
feminine
five
foot
three
in
her
stockinged
feet
,
who
turned
all
the
men
's
head
when
she
passed
.
A
distinct
advantage
.
And
the
enigma
did
not
end
there
.
Why
,
he
kept
asking
himself
,
did
a
woman
,
trained
in
the
art
of
healing
,
who
had
been
a
naval
medical
officer
and
not
somebody
's
wife
,
suddenly
volunteer
for
something
that
was
inevitably
going
to
be
highly
dangerous
-
and
almost
certainly
involve
her
in
killing
-
at
close
quarters
?
Her
records
were
,
of
course
,
put
at
his
disposal
.
They
were
alarmingly
sparse
.
Born
in
London
of
an
Irish
mother
and
a
Scottish
father
,
she
had
been
educated
at
a
convent
school
in
North
London
.
From
there
she
had
entered
University
College
Hospital
,
emerging
seven
years
later
with
her
medical
qualifications
.
After
appointments
in
community
service
,
she
had
joined
the
Navy
.
All
straight
forward
.
The
only
thing
that
was
to
him
suspicious
,
was
apart
from
the
normality
of
liaisons
at
the
hospital
,
there
was
no
mention
of
a
man
in
her
life
.
And
judging
from
his
own
reactions
he
knew
that
was
impossible
.
But
she
put
up
a
barrier
around
her
,
and
allowed
no
one
to
pass
.
When
she
'd
been
selected
,
and
automatically
compelled
to
leave
the
Navy
,
taking
an
appointment
at
a
civilian
hospital
,
he
'd
told
himself
that
it
was
his
duty
to
visit
her
to
see
that
she
was
settled
in
-
not
lonely
.
But
it
had
come
to
nothing
,
and
in
the
process
he
had
recognised
the
truth
behind
his
motives
.
That
he
was
attracted
to
her
.
Delaney
spent
some
twenty
minutes
with
the
captain
and
crew
in
the
red-lit
cockpit
with
its
enormous
banks
of
dials
,
before
passing
back
to
change
out
of
his
suit
and
to
check
his
own
equipment
.
Forster
and
Grant
were
asleep
.
Lawton
was
reading
Blake
by
the
light
of
a
spot
lamp
.
Silk
was
cleaning
his
Uzi
folding
stock
9
mm
machine-gun
-
the
group
's
favourite
close
quarter
weapon
,
other
than
the
knife
.
Doctor
Anderson
was
tying
her
hair
back
,
pinning
it
tightly
to
her
head
.
The
toilet
of
the
female
,
Delaney
mused
.
And
a
species
deadlier
than
the
male
.
Nell
Anderson
glanced
up
as
Delaney
came
past
,
making
his
way
to
the
pre-loaded
freight
pallets
,
the
liftmaster
,
and
his
kit
.
Very
thorough
,
she
mused
.
For
John
Delaney
checked
everything
.
Nell
finished
tightly
tucking
in
the
last
strand
of
hair
,
and
pulled
on
a
black
woollen
balaclava
before
snuggling
down
into
her
sleeping
bag
,
turning
her
face
to
the
fuselage
wall
.
Unlike
the
others
,
sleep
did
not
come
easily
to
her
before
a
job
.
They
had
had
longer
to
become
philosophical
.
More
fatalistic
.
Sleep
did
n't
come
easily
when
she
was
at
home
,
or
rather
in
the
room
at
the
hospital
.
And
before
that
a
succession
of
rooms
.
Home
?
She
'd
never
known
a
true
home
.
Not
that
her
father
and
mother
had
divorced
.
They
had
just
simply
and
totally
fallen
out
of
love
with
each
other
,
and
like
the
devout
Catholics
they
were
,
carried
on
as
a
pretence
.
So
she
had
grown
up
in
a
cold
,
almost
emotionally
empty
vacuum
.
If
only
they
had
fought
,
screamed
at
one
another
,
gone
their
separate
ways
,
even
had
lovers
-
anything
but
the
sterility
of
it
all
,
a
sterility
that
had
finally
been
injected
into
everything
they
touched
.
Nell
laid
her
cheek
on
her
hands
,
held
together
as
if
in
prayer
,
forming
a
pillow
.
At
school
,
compensating
,
she
had
worked
and
worked
and
worked
,
so
much
so
that
she
had
finally
made
the
two
A's
and
a
B
necessary
for
medicine
in
her
A
levels
.
It
was
to
be
the
key
.
The
way
out
.
And
then
in
the
clinical
years
,
the
disillusion
,
the
suffering
,
the
unfairness
,
the
dying
,
the
inevitability
of
it
all
.
Growing
old
,
the
process
of
decay
had
eroded
into
her
one
reaming
confidence
.
Her
youth
.
Now
,
Nell
could
not
conceive
of
love
between
a
man
and
a
woman
,
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
ageing
.
Trapped
in
her
own
loneliness
,
suicide
had
begun
to
dominate
her
thoughts
.
As
a
doctor
it
would
have
been
so
easy
,
and
that
very
easiness
,
not
her
by
now
nominal
Catholicism
,
had
held
her
back
,
temporarily
,
from
what
she
knew
would
be
inevitable
one
day
-
before
she
was
forty
.
She
could
imagine
the
coroner
's
disinterested
voice
.
"
-
overdose
while
in
a
depressed
state
-
balance
of
mind
disturbed
.
"
Then
,
while
a
Navy
surgeon
lieutenant
-
she
liked
the
sport
and
a
contract
that
would
last
nicely
into
her
forties
-
had
come
the
memoranda
.
With
its
hints
of
dangerous
work
and
high
selectivity
it
had
seemed
like
nature
's
way
.
The
survival
of
the
fittest
.
Except
that
she
would
not
survive
.
Trained
as
they
were
,
the
psychiatrists
on
the
screening
tests
had
failed
to
scratch
the
surface
of
her
most
secret
place
;
had
failed
to
detect
the
urge
to
self-destruction
which
would
automatically
bar
her
from
G9
,
as
it
did
in
the
SAS
and
SBS
.
In
the
steady
,
stupefying
roar
of
the
Hercules
,
she
drifted
into
an
area
that
was
not
sleep
,
yet
not
awake
,
a
sort
of
limbo
where
she
could
direct
her
thoughts
-
as
in
a
dream
.
Sex
?
She
was
not
afraid
of
it
.
She
had
slept
with
three
men
in
her
life
.
It
had
nothing
to
do
with
giving
herself
.
John
Delaney
's
face
came
into
the
dream
.
His
interest
in
her
had
been
obvious
,
and
because
of
that
she
had
discouraged
it
.
Somehow
he
made
her
feel
uneasy
.
There
was
something
about
Delaney
,
something
indefinable
,
that
worried
her
.
His
almost
too
handsome
face
,
for
her
taste
,
that
is
,
was
saved
by
the
warmth
of
his
eyes
,
though
at
times
they
could
become
frightening
.
Then
they
were
hard
,
cold
,
merciless
windows
into
an
inner
world
of
violence
.
Instinctively
she
had
sensed
that
Delaney
would
demand
more
of
her
than
a
passing
gratification
.
She
sensed
that
he
needed
more
,
and
this
was
something
that
she
could
not
give
-
the
secret
places
of
her
mind
.
Satisfied
,
Barry
Silk
laid
the
last
item
of
his
equipment
lovingly
down
,
almost
as
if
for
a
kit
inspection
.
He
checked
his
watch
.
Another
three
hours
.
He
lay
back
,
resting
his
head
on
his
hands
that
were
clasped
behind
him
,
closing
his
eyes
even
though
he
did
not
feel
like
sleep
.
He
was
making
sure
they
were
not
exposed
to
any
form
of
light
source
,
however
muted
.
When
he
worked
at
night
he
prepared
properly
,
never
allowing
his
vision
to
become
impaired
in
any
way
.
It
could
mean
the
difference
between
life
-
or
death
.
He
smiled
contentedly
.
Lawton
turned
the
page
of
his
pocket
edition
of
Blake
.
When
the
stars
threw
down
their
spears
And
water
'd
heaven
with
their
tears
Did
he
smile
his
work
to
see
?
Did
he
who
made
the
lamb
make
thee
?
Tyger
!
Tyger
!
burning
bright
In
the
forests
of
the
night
,
What
immortal
hand
or
eye
,
Dare
frame
thy
fearful
symmetry
.
It
was
one
of
his
favourites
from
The
Songs
of
Experience
.
He
closed
the
book
and
slipped
it
into
a
polythene
bag
.
Even
now
he
did
n't
fully
know
what
was
meant
by
the
line
the
stars
threw
down
their
spears
.
And
it
did
n't
help
him
to
know
the
scholars
found
it
equally
obscure
.
The
forest
of
the
night
always
made
him
shiver
-
the
association
with
nameless
terrors
peering
at
him
through
the
jungle
of
a
Rousseau
painting
on
his
childhood
wall
.
Blake
had
meant
the
associated
darkness
to
be
the
haunts
of
man
's
errors
.
The
nightmare
side
of
his
intellect
.
He
tucked
the
polythene
bag
into
the
waterproofed
ammunition
pouch
.
His
gut
was
beginning
to
play
him
up
.
Careful
not
to
wake
the
others
,
he
made
his
way
for
the
third
time
to
the
lavatory
.
Lawton
smiled
.
They
never
had
bowel
trouble
in
the
movies
.
As
he
sat
in
a
roaring
solitary
splendour
twenty
thousand
feet
over
the
turbulent
,
endless
ocean
wastes
,
he
had
no
idea
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
poem
he
had
just
read
.
Forster
dreamed
of
a
beautiful
,
sophisticated
woman
.
Dressed
in
a
plain
blue
silk
suit
,
seamed
stockings
and
high
heels
,
she
sipped
her
champagne
,
red
lips
peeking
just
below
the
rim
of
the
net
coming
from
a
dainty
little
hat
.
Haughty
,
cold
,
and
ignoring
him
,
she
could
not
disguise
the
hunger
in
the
large
brown
eyes
behind
the
net
.
They
found
his
.
Mysteriously
they
were
alone
now
,
all
the
other
people
in
the
room
had
gone
,
with
the
breeze
gently
swirling
the
curtains
of
the
French
windows
leading
out
on
to
the
terrace
.
Slowly
he
put
down
his
glass
and
moved
towards
her
.
Defiantly
her
chin
came
up
,
challenging
him
,
warning
that
he
was
beneath
her
dignity
;
that
if
he
tried
to
hiss
her
she
would
-
He
did
n't
kiss
her
.
His
hand
went
out
and
cupped
her
breast
crudely
.
Her
eyes
blazed
with
shock
,
and
-
The
"
plane
bumped
,
rolling
Forster
roughly
to
one
side
,
catapulting
him
into
the
bleakness
of
reality
.
The
"
plane
rolled
and
shuddered
again
.
Forster
hauled
himself
to
his
feet
,
clinging
to
the
sides
and
overhead
rails
for
support
as
he
picked
his
way
over
to
Delaney
.
Seat
belt
signs
were
flashing
everywhere
.
"
What
's
this
,
then
?
I
thought
you
said
the
weather
report
indicated
gale
conditions
after
dawn
.
"
Delaney
nodded
.
"
They
did
,
"
he
affirmed
.
"
I
'm
going
to
check
with
the
pilot
.
Get
everybody
ready
.
We
're
less
than
forty
minutes
out
now
.
"
As
he
entered
the
cockpit
,
the
pilot
looked
worriedly
over
his
shoulder
.
"
Bad
turbulence
.
We
seem
to
have
run
right
into
it
.
"
Delaney
settled
on
to
his
haunches
between
the
two
seats
,
and
hung
on
grimly
.
"
What
is
it
like
at
the
DZ
?
"
The
pilot
shook
his
head
.
"
Ca
n't
be
good
.
I
take
it
you
'll
want
to
call
the
Big
House
?
"
"
The
MOD
communications
centre
?
Yes
.
"
Tight-lipped
,
Delaney
nodded
,
and
moved
over
to
the
radio
desk
.
The
operator
's
face
was
screwed
up
in
concentration
,
one
hand
clamped
to
his
left
ear
plug
as
he
manipulated
the
dials
of
the
set
.
"
We
're
getting
a
lot
of
interference
,
"
he
said
.
"
They
're
barely
audible
.
"
Delaney
patiently
waited
while
the
operator
re-established
the
link
.
Then
he
spoke
into
a
reserve
speaker
,
using
the
designated
call
for
the
operation
.
His
ears
were
filled
with
a
great
roaring
,
a
voice
only
just
discernible
,
but
unintelligible
,
in
its
midst
.
He
tried
several
times
.
But
it
was
useless
.
Finally
,
the
operator
pulled
out
a
small
metal
box
from
a
rack
underneath
his
desk
,
deftly
flipped
back
the
lid
and
plugged
in
the
connection
.
"
Nothing
for
it
but
to
try
this
.
"
He
began
tapping
out
his
identification
in
morse
code
.
It
took
five
minutes
to
establish
the
link
,
and
for
the
operator
to
get
out
Delaney
's
short
message
requesting
an
abort
due
to
extreme
winds
in
the
drop
zone
.
The
signal
was
acknowledged
and
they
were
advised
to
hold
.
Delaney
steadied
himself
as
the
"
plane
lurched
.
The
pilot
glanced
back
at
him
.
"
They
ca
n't
let
you
go
down
in
this
,
"
he
said
with
concern
.
"
It
would
be
suicide
.
"
The
co-pilot
shook
his
head
.
"
Funny
that
the
met
people
should
get
it
so
wrong
.
"
Outside
the
flight
deck
,
a
wisp
of
white
flicked
past
the
black
window
.
Why
did
Delaney
suddenly
find
he
was
suspicious
about
the
meteorological
report
?
It
took
nearly
five
minutes
before
Delaney
,
wearing
a
second
set
of
earphones
,
looked
up
sharply
to
make
sure
that
the
radioman
,
swearing
at
the
weird
interference
,
could
hear
the
stream
of
dots
and
dashes
coming
in
.
De-coded
,
the
operator
swung
on
his
seat
to
face
him
.
But
Delaney
could
already
read
the
answer
in
the
grim
,
red-lit
face
.
"
The
message
is
"
Albatross
"
,
sir
.
"
It
was
the
no-abort
,
go
at
any
cost
signal
.
Delaney
made
his
way
through
the
crew
door
into
the
cavernous
section
of
the
C130
that
gave
it
its
friendly
nick-name
of
Fat
Albert
.
The
others
were
waiting
expectantly
,
five
subhuman
looking
creatures
encased
in
pitch
black
rubber
wet
suits
with
continuous
flipper-like
boots
,
and
hoods
that
formed
an
evil-looking
cowl
around
faces
streaked
with
black
camouflage
paint
.
"
Well
?
"
Lawton
spoke
for
all
of
them
.
"
It
's
go
,
"
Delaney
said
cryptically
.
Unbelievably
,
for
a
split
second
,
he
was
sure
he
saw
a
look
of
relief
on
the
face
of
Nell
Anderson
.
Barry
Silk
immediately
carried
on
with
his
preparations
,
slipping
a
six
inch
long
knife
into
its
calf
holster
and
tagging
the
retaining
strap
.
Eugene
Forster
chuckled
-
without
humour
.
"
They
must
have
a
hell
of
a
reason
for
wanting
us
on
that
boat
.
"
The
jumpster
checked
with
the
pilot
one
last
time
on
the
inter-com
,
then
pressed
the
red
button
that
operated
the
hydraulic
system
.
The
roaring
engine
was
joined
by
another
,
high
pitched
whine
.
Slowly
the
hatch
,
like
some
huge
drawbridge
,
opened
out
,
the
wind
gusting
and
swirling
,
physically
reaching
in
for
them
.
They
stood
in
two
rows
,
hooked
up
to
the
static
lines
,
weighed
down
with
parachutes
and
air
tanks
,
waterproofed
combat
kits
,
clutching
personal
inflatable
rafts
attached
with
five
metres
of
line
to
their
belts
,
eyes
tense
behind
the
vizors
of
the
face
masks
.
The
waiting
,
the
worst
part
,
was
reaching
its
almost
unbearable
climax
.
The
first
flare
was
fired
,
dropping
away
to
explode
into
fiery
incandescence
a
thousand
feet
above
the
surface
,
a
snaking
,
burning
star
suspended
on
a
miniature
parachute
.
Delaney
,
Lawton
and
the
jumpmaster
looked
down
.
The
sea
was
etched
as
if
in
some
surrealistic
,
two
dimensional
painting
,
a
restless
scene
caught
in
an
endless
camera
flash
that
pushed
back
the
night
.
Great
grey-green
swells
moved
majestically
along
,
latticed
with
white
foam
that
spiralled
and
blew
from
the
crests
into
the
blackness
:
a
cold
,
frightening
,
endless
waste
of
water
.
The
jumpmaster
could
not
contain
himself
.
"
Rather
you
than
me
,
"
he
said
with
irony
.
The
Hercules
banked
,
drew
away
from
the
pool
of
light
,
then
back
into
the
merciful
,
all
concealing
blackness
.
Delaney
stirred
himself
.
"
Right
.
We
go
on
the
next
pass
.
"
The
"
plane
lumbered
around
,
came
back
into
the
wind
,
and
began
its
second
run
in
over
the
target
zone
.
Delaney
turned
to
the
group
.
"
Good
luck
,
"
he
called
,
and
found
himself
looking
at
Nell
.
Apart
from
her
shortness
she
was
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
others
,
except
for
the
largeness
of
her
green
eyes
.
They
seemed
to
be
gleaming
behind
the
glass
.
Anticipation
?
The
Hercules
came
in
dangerously
low
for
a
drop
,
just
below
five
hundred
feet
,
on
Delaney
's
orders
,
to
ensure
the
minimum
dispersion
of
the
stick
over
the
DZ
.
The
dispatcher
raised
his
arm
,
watching
the
red
bulb
above
his
head
.
Somewhere
below
another
flare
exploded
,
its
fresh
glare
lighting
up
in
stark
relief
the
yawning
edge
of
the
aircraft
.
They
waited
-
waited
before
the
edge
that
could
lead
to
eternity
.
The
red
light
became
green
.
The
dispatcher
's
arm
fell
.
One
after
the
other
the
pallets
with
the
self-inflating
assault
boats
disappeared
,
tipping
forward
out
into
the
night
,
static
lines
ripping
and
jerking
,
the
snap
of
the
opening
canopies
clearly
audible
above
the
roar
of
the
engine
,
the
wind
and
the
ocean
.
The
last
one
fell
away
.
"
Stand
by
.
"
The
dispatcher
counted
the
seconds
on
his
large
watch
,
then
chopped
his
arm
.
"
Go
!
"
One
after
the
other
,
on
the
run
,
and
without
hesitation
,
they
took
the
fatal
one
step
into
the
night
.
When
the
last
figure
had
gone
,
the
liftmaster
stabbed
at
the
button
operating
the
ramp
.
The
hydraulics
gave
out
their
whine
as
he
joined
other
crew
members
staring
down
at
the
scene
below
and
half
a
mile
back
.
More
flares
had
joined
the
others
,
illuminating
the
area
like
some
fiery
aquatic
tattoo
.
The
stick
of
parachutes
resembled
giant
wind-born
seeds
,
the
tiny
figures
dark
specks
against
the
cold
grey
sea
.
Below
each
speck
,
attacked
by
the
unseen
lines
were
the
dark
smudges
of
the
personal
life
rafts
that
would
hit
the
water
seconds
before
their
bodies
.
Even
as
they
watched
,
the
first
faint
splash
marked
an
impact
,
followed
by
others
,
and
then
the
crumpling
of
the
canopies
.
Suddenly
,
for
the
aircrew
,
the
endless
backdrop
of
the
ocean
was
violated
,
cut
by
the
appearance
from
under
the
Hercules
of
the
straight
,
man-made
lines
of
Titron
.
It
was
a
fleeting
glimpse
,
quickly
blocked
off
by
the
turning
"
plane
and
rising
ramp
.
But
it
was
enough
to
see
the
huge
steel
bulk
,
with
white
waves
licking
hungrily
up
its
vast
sides
,
and
the
grey
superstructure
topped
with
the
red
funnel
.
And
in
that
fleeting
view
,
just
as
they
flashed
over-head
,
something
bulky
on
the
deck
moved
,
back
into
the
deep
,
razor-edged
black
shadow
.
"
What
the
hell
was
that
?
"
The
liftmaster
looked
at
the
others
questioningly
.
Then
the
ship
was
lost
from
view
,
and
the
whole
weird
,
spectacular
scene
,
like
a
Dante
vision
of
a
watery
Hell
,
was
replaced
by
the
familiar
interior
of
the
ramp
.
As
soon
as
his
life
raft
boomed
into
the
sea
,
Delaney
pulled
the
quick
release
tag
and
dropped
from
his
harness
.
Elbows
in
,
hands
on
vizor
,
and
legs
bent
together
,
he
plunged
into
the
water
.
Shock
.
Cold
.
He
pulled
down
,
twisting
around
to
follow
the
line
attached
to
his
belt
.
It
was
a
dream-like
,
reversed
world
,
not
unlike
a
film
negative
.
Above
him
was
a
bright
layer
of
restless
,
silvery
white
,
the
balls
of
shining
air
rushing
from
his
escape
valve
carrying
their
own
brightness
to
the
world
of
light
above
.
Even
as
he
made
back
up
towards
it
,
half
pulling
,
half
swimming
along
the
line
leading
towards
the
rapidly
swelling
shape
that
he
knew
was
his
raft
,
the
water
he
was
in
turned
solid
,
sweeping
him
effortlessly
to
one
side
.
The
wave
must
have
been
fifteen
feet
high
.
He
broke
surface
,
his
own
breathing
hissing
and
venting
in
his
ears
.
With
powerful
leg
strokes
,
moving
just
beneath
the
surface
he
closed
with
the
raft
,
and
got
his
hand
on
the
rope
grab
handles
.
Before
he
could
do
anything
more
another
wave
lifted
him
high
into
the
foam-filled
wind
,
then
dizzyingly
dropped
him
down
into
a
hole
in
the
ocean
.
In
the
seconds
at
the
bottom
when
everything
had
steadied
,
when
there
was
n't
a
breath
of
air
,
just
a
strange
unreal
calm
,
he
rolled
over
the
edge
and
clawed
his
way
on
to
the
thin
rubber
bottom
of
the
raft
.
Like
a
ride
in
a
big
dipper
,
he
felt
the
floor
pushing
up
at
him
,
gathering
speed
as
they
climbed
a
wave
.
He
raised
his
head
,
searching
.
Near
him
was
the
nylon
canopy
of
his
"
chute
,
drifting
like
some
giant
Portuguese
man-o'-war
.
Beyond
it
was
another
raft
with
,
even
as
he
watched
,
a
dark
shape
rearing
up
out
of
the
sea
alongside
.
On
his
stomach
,
he
paddled
with
his
hands
towards
it
.
The
flares
were
hanging
low
,
only
some
twenty
seconds
of
light
remaining
.
It
was
Eugene
Forster
.
Together
they
searched
the
towering
walls
of
moving
water
.
Forster
thumped
Delaney
's
arm
and
pointed
.
One
hundred
feet
away
was
one
of
the
assault
boats
,
self-inflated
with
a
figure
already
aboard
.
They
made
towards
it
as
the
first
flare
hit
the
sea
,
continuing
to
burn
,
with
clouds
of
smoke
drifting
upwards
.
The
figure
in
the
boat
raised
an
arm
.
There
was
a
crack
and
a
hiss
,
and
a
flare
exploded
into
life
above
their
heads
.
Theodore
Lawton
ejected
the
cartridge
,
took
another
one
,
and
fired
it
over
the
side
.
Satisfied
,
he
quickly
knelt
down
,
steadied
himself
,
then
slipped
the
flare
gun
back
into
its
holder
in
the
boat
's
side
.
Nell
Anderson
heard
the
splash
as
her
raft
went
in
,
felt
the
five
metre
line
slacken
-
then
everything
went
wrong
.
She
was
reaching
for
her
quick
release
handle
as
a
solid
wall
of
water
struck
her
sideways
on
,
tumbling
her
into
the
rigging
of
the
"
chute
,
and
pulling
the
air
line
from
her
mouth
.
A
white
torrent
roared
out
in
front
of
her
face
,
blinding
,
choking
,
as
her
frenzied
kicking
legs
caught
in
the
"
chute
rigging
,
binding
them
together
.
Panic
.
Nell
Anderson
knew
she
was
seconds
from
death
,
and
that
despite
her
desire
for
it
,
the
moment
it
was
on
her
was
terrifying
in
its
violence
.
She
took
a
grip
on
herself
,
physically
pushed
back
the
dark
,
claustrophobic
horror
at
the
point
of
drowning
.
She
had
been
trained
to
survive
;
to
do
things
instinctively
.
She
could
not
die
by
giving
up
.
That
would
not
be
right
.
And
from
that
moment
she
began
to
think
clearly
,
rationally
,
and
ceased
to
struggle
.
In
the
last
second
before
the
knifing
pain
in
her
chest
forced
her
to
breath
in
water
she
found
the
dangling
mouthpiece
,
and
pushed
it
back
between
her
teeth
.
Even
as
another
rolling
hill
of
a
wave
tumbled
her
dizzyingly
further
into
the
"
chute
,
the
air
was
hissing
and
venting
in
her
breathing
system
,
easing
the
pain
,
and
delivering
her
from
the
edge
of
eternity
.
She
reached
for
the
knife
at
her
calf
,
and
began
cutting
the
rigging
binding
her
legs
.
It
took
several
minutes
,
and
then
suddenly
another
wave
pulled
the
last
line
free
,
unwinding
from
her
thigh
,
to
relinquish
its
grip
like
some
long
thin
tentacle
.
She
surfaced
beneath
the
canopy
,
dived
again
and
powered
forward
until
she
could
see
clear
water
above
.
As
Nell
Anderson
came
to
the
surface
yet
another
huge
wave
arrived
.
There
was
no
sign
of
her
raft
,
the
line
of
which
she
realised
she
had
cut
.
The
hill
of
water
lifted
her
,
giving
a
view
of
the
area
.
Away
to
the
left
a
flare
hit
the
water
,
clouds
of
smoke
rolling
over
the
surface
towards
her
.
It
still
burned
with
a
harsh
,
blinding
glare
and
through
it
she
could
see
vague
shapes
,
presumably
the
others
.
The
wave
passed
on
,
dropping
her
into
a
terrifyingly
deep
trough
,
cutting
off
all
contact
;
a
solitary
cell
of
blank
,
featureless
water
.
She
ducked
her
head
in
,
and
tried
to
go
deeper
before
making
towards
the
fallen
flare
.
Barry
Silk
hit
the
water
textbook
fashion
.
He
made
it
without
difficulty
on
to
his
raft
,
swinging
it
round
to
join
the
group
he
had
noticed
dropping
away
to
his
left
;
and
was
overturned
by
a
breaking
wave
.
There
was
no
trace
of
the
yellow
and
orange
raft
when
he
surfaced
.
And
it
did
n't
overly
worry
him
.
With
powerful
leg
strokes
he
made
for
the
assault
boat
from
which
new
flares
were
being
fired
.
Martin
Grant
's
parachute
malfunctioned
immediately
he
left
the
aircraft
.
The
peripheral
hem
blew
back
over
the
canopy
,
dividing
it
into
two
lobes
.
Last
of
his
stick
to
leave
the
C130
,
Grant
's
rate
of
descent
was
half
again
as
fast
as
the
rest
,
taking
him
past
the
others
,
and
plummeting
him
down
in
a
whirling
corkscrew
.
Desperately
he
hauled
on
the
lines
,
trying
to
pull
them
free
,
knowing
he
was
too
low
to
deploy
the
reserve
.
One
hundred
feet
up
it
snapped
into
full
canopy
.
Still
moving
fast
he
went
into
the
sea
,
his
left
leg
jerking
violently
as
the
still
unopened
life
raft
got
in
the
way
.
Excruciating
pain
stabbed
up
into
his
groin
.
It
took
all
his
willpower
to
keep
his
teeth
biting
into
the
rubber
.
The
scream
stifled
in
his
head
.
For
a
second
he
blacked
out
,
coming
to
as
something
big
rammed
into
his
back
.
Disorientated
for
a
frightening
moment
,
he
panicked
,
thinking
it
was
a
shark
.
Then
his
training
took
over
.
He
went
down
fast
,
clawing
at
the
water
with
his
hands
,
trailing
his
useless
leg
,
and
praying
there
was
no
blood
pumping
out
,
clouding
the
water
,
and
contaminating
it
with
its
smell
.
Doubled
up
he
drew
his
knife
,
eyes
behind
the
vizor
desperately
searching
the
inky
blackness
.
Then
he
was
up
to
the
silvery
layer
of
the
surface
.
Relief
.
He
knew
then
what
it
had
been
.
The
large
shape
of
one
of
the
assault
boats
was
still
forming
,
stretching
ever
further
as
he
watched
,
and
folding
out
on
itself
.
Thankfully
he
went
up
to
it
,
getting
a
grip
on
its
side
ropes
as
he
surfaced
.
Despite
the
pain
,
he
managed
to
push
up
out
of
the
water
and
roll
with
practised
efficiency
over
the
side
,
and
in
.
Thankfully
,
Grant
was
totally
unaware
of
the
large
grey
shape
that
powered
effortlessly
and
hungrily
past
,
as
his
boots
left
the
water
.
Its
age
old
pre-historic
instinct
had
brought
it
and
many
others
to
the
spot
a
day
ago
in
a
bloody
frenzy
of
feeding
.
Delaney
and
Forster
reached
Lawton
who
helped
them
one
at
a
time
into
the
boat
.
Delaney
clambered
in
last
.
"
Any
sign
of
the
others
?
"
he
asked
.
Lawton
pointed
.
"
One
of
mine
came
past
in
a
hurry
.
Went
down
with
a
bang
over
there
.
"
They
slipped
the
paddles
from
their
containing
sleeves
,
and
using
short
hard
jabs
began
moving
,
cresting
a
wave
and
plunging
down
the
other
side
,
knowing
that
whoever
it
was
would
be
in
serious
trouble
.
Nell
Anderson
could
n't
understand
it
.
The
more
she
swam
,
no
nearer
did
the
assault
boat
seem
to
get
.
There
was
nothing
more
she
could
do
but
try
again
.
Feeling
the
tiredness
and
the
coldness
creeping
into
her
body
,
she
swam
without
looking
,
putting
everything
into
the
effort
.
Finally
,
exhausted
,
she
stopped
and
looked
up
.
This
time
she
knew
why
,
seeing
on
the
top
of
the
wave
,
the
movement
of
the
man
and
paddles
.
They
were
pulling
away
from
her
.
Even
as
she
watched
they
disappeared
over
the
edge
,
leaving
her
in
a
watery
isolation
.
Almost
dispassionately
she
thought
:
I
'll
never
be
picked
up
.
Soon
,
she
would
be
left
in
the
darkness
,
in
the
middle
of
an
ocean
,
thousands
of
miles
from
anywhere
.
Coming
to
that
realisation
so
soon
after
her
panic
at
drowning
did
n't
seem
to
worry
her
as
much
as
it
should
have
done
.
But
then
,
she
'd
been
lonely
all
her
life
.
Barry
Silk
was
better
placed
.
As
soon
as
he
realised
what
was
happening
he
put
the
pressure
on
,
and
was
closing
with
them
when
he
saw
another
assault
boat
.
It
appeared
to
be
empty
.
He
changed
course
and
reached
it
,
just
as
a
hand
came
into
view
,
with
the
top
of
somebody
's
headgear
lying
inside
.
Shakily
,
Martin
Grant
raised
the
flare
gun
and
fired
.
Two
assault
boats
were
more
than
Delaney
had
dared
hope
for
.
They
'd
dropped
four
,
each
prepacked
with
a
selection
of
gear
.
Under
these
conditions
they
could
have
expected
a
higher
failure
rate
.
Barry
Silk
was
already
with
Martin
Grant
when
they
came
alongside
.
Choosing
his
moment
,
Lawton
transferred
as
Delaney
passed
a
rope
to
Grant
.
Delaney
shouted
through
the
spray
.
"
Any
sign
of
Nell
?
"
Grant
shook
his
head
.
After
he
had
clambered
across
he
searched
again
,
feeling
desperate
.
Only
an
empty
yellow
raft
was
in
sight
in
the
lit-up
area
.
It
looked
ominous
.
The
Hercules
made
another
,
much
higher
pass
,
its
whine
almost
lost
in
the
roaring
sea
.
A
sudden
boom
followed
in
its
wake
,
a
new
parachute
flare
splitting
the
night
sky
-
a
red
target
flare
.
Beneath
it
for
the
first
time
,
they
saw
Titron
,
lying
in
the
water
some
quarter
of
a
mile
away
;
a
huge
,
red-lit
steel
cliff
with
the
black
sea
boiling
pinky-white
below
.
For
a
moment
they
all
froze
,
staring
at
it
.
Silk
broke
the
silence
.
"
It
's
a
hell
of
a
size
.
"
The
rules
were
well
defined
and
clear-cut
.
Delaney
should
now
quickly
gather
all
surviving
members
of
his
force
and
make
for
the
target
,
with
no
potentially
dangerous
searches
.
It
was
accepted
.
Everyone
knew
it
.
And
Nell
was
no
exception
.
He
felt
their
eyes
on
him
.
The
target
flare
had
burst
behind
her
,
lighting
the
whole
area
with
its
fiery
red
glow
.
Nell
Anderson
stopped
,
treading
water
as
she
tried
to
work
it
out
.
She
was
between
Titron
and
the
assault
boat
which
had
been
going
away
from
it
.
But
it
would
have
to
come
back
,
passing
anywhere
in
an
area
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
either
side
.
It
would
need
only
fifty
feet
either
way
,
and
she
could
not
be
seen
.
She
waited
.
"
There
!
"
Delaney
pointed
,
having
seen
something
bobbing
in
the
water
.
As
they
got
nearer
they
could
see
it
was
some-one
,
head
and
shoulders
clearly
visible
.
It
had
to
be
Nell
.
Delaney
shouted
,
saw
her
going
under
,
and
knew
from
the
strange
lethargic
roll
as
a
wave
washed
past
,
that
something
was
desperately
wrong
.
Almost
on
top
of
Nell
,
he
snapped
his
mask
back
down
over
his
face
,
bit
on
the
breathing
tube
,
and
went
in
backwards
.
He
came
up
behind
her
,
reaching
out
as
water
washed
in
a
surface
line
over
the
glass
of
his
vizor
.
Delaney
spun
her
around
-
and
gagged
.
The
face
was
grinning
,
cheekless
,
with
an
eye
hanging
on
to
bare
bone
,
glistening
raw
meat
where
great
tooth
marks
showed
clearly
it
had
been
half
eaten
.
It
was
a
passing
glimpse
,
since
there
was
nothing
else
from
the
chest
down
,
his
pull
spinning
the
lightened
torso
around
,
almost
weightless
in
the
water
.
Forster
got
Delaney
back
into
the
boat
,
leaving
the
gruesome
remains
to
continue
on
their
grinning
journey
.
"
Jesus
Christ
!
"
Forster
breathed
out
the
profanity
.
"
Must
have
been
one
of
the
crew
.
"
Involuntarily
,
they
all
looked
towards
Titron
again
.
"
The
sooner
we
get
aboard
the
better
,
"
Lawton
said
quietly
.
Silk
was
more
pointed
.
"
The
weather
's
getting
worse
.
We
'll
have
to
leave
her
.
"
Delaney
found
he
could
n't
say
anything
.
He
simply
nodded
.
As
they
paddled
in
silence
,
Delaney
bit
back
the
rising
ache
in
his
throat
.
Why
in
God
's
name
had
he
let
Nell
Anderson
come
?
Even
allowed
her
to
join
the
unit
?
He
could
have
found
some
excuse
for
downgrading
her
.
Some
of
the
others
-
Silk
especially
-
was
against
the
inclusion
of
a
female
in
the
unit
.
But
Delaney
knew
if
he
had
refused
her
to
come
along
,
Nell
would
have
downgraded
him
.
His
body
seemed
heavy
,
let
alone
his
heart
.
She
saw
them
coming
,
yet
knew
she
could
not
intercept
them
in
time
.
There
was
only
one
thing
she
could
think
of
to
do
.
After
that
it
would
be
too
late
.
Strapped
to
her
stomach
,
low
down
,
was
the
waterproof
personal
weapon
's
bag
.
She
got
her
hands
to
it
,
unfastened
the
buckles
,
and
in
her
fumblings
,
nearly
let
it
go
.
If
she
had
it
would
have
sunk
-
instantly
.
On
her
back
now
,
bag
clear
of
the
water
,
she
began
to
unzip
it
,
trying
to
keep
it
dry
.
The
Uzi
sub-machine
gun
with
the
folding
stock
was
the
main
armament
.
It
came
clear
from
the
bag
,
her
finger
slipping
on
to
the
trigger
,
thumb
freeing
the
safety
catch
.
She
raised
the
barrel
skywards
,
and
was
tumbled
over
by
a
breaking
wave
.
The
gun
jerked
,
sent
several
rounds
into
the
air
before
it
sprayed
away
down
into
the
ocean
,
and
jammed
.
Bitter
salt
water
got
past
the
mouthpiece
,
choking
her
,
eyes
streaming
with
the
effort
of
coughing
.
Still
half
blind
,
she
tried
again
.
Nothing
happened
.
She
tried
again
.
And
again
.
Nothing
.
She
threw
it
away
,
then
fumbled
in
the
bag
,
her
hand
finding
the
solid
objects
racked
neatly
in
its
side
.
She
drew
one
out
.
Spitting
her
mouthpiece
away
she
drew
the
pin
with
her
teeth
and
lobbed
the
grenade
in
their
direction
.
The
shortened
burst
of
automatic
fire
from
Nell
's
Uzi
had
cut
into
the
night
and
was
gone
before
it
could
be
properly
assimilated
.
As
one
,
they
stopped
paddling
,
crouching
low
,
eyes
quartering
the
area
adjacent
to
their
part
of
the
boat
,
unsure
of
its
direction
.
"
What
the
hell
was
that
?
"
Forster
asked
.
"
Definitely
gunfire
,
"
Silk
observed
.
"
Russians
?
Or
whoever
's
on
Titron
?
"
Lawton
suggested
.
But
Silk
was
adamant
.
"
That
was
a
Uzi
.
"
With
a
rush
Delaney
realised
.
"
It
's
Nell
,
"
he
yelled
.
"
But
for
God
's
sake
-
which
direction
?
"
as
if
in
answer
to
his
question
,
they
heard
the
grenade
explode
;
the
water
around
it
spasmed
,
sending
a
central
jet
erupting
skywards
to
be
almost
instantly
swept
away
by
the
wind
.
But
it
was
enough
.
"
There
!
"
Forster
yelled
,
and
pointed
a
directional
finger
.
Delaney
dug
his
paddle
into
the
sea
,
urgently
.
"
Move
!
"
he
ordered
.
"
Move
!
"
Feverishly
they
attacked
the
sea
,
their
eyes
straining
for
any
sign
of
movement
in
the
red-tinged
,
black
water
.
They
were
almost
on
top
of
Nell
before
Delaney
saw
the
bobbing
head
.
"
We
've
got
her
-
thank
God
!
"
He
reached
down
,
both
hands
finding
hers
.
With
Forster
supporting
his
legs
,
Delaney
used
the
forward
motion
of
the
boat
to
haul
Nell
from
the
water
,
finally
landing
her
like
a
slippery
black
sea
creature
.
Exhausted
,
Nell
looked
up
at
Delaney
,
a
wry
smile
crossing
her
white
,
cold
face
.
"
I
do
n't
usually
accept
lifts
from
strange
men
.
"
Delaney
grinned
,
the
creases
around
his
eyes
deepening
.
"
Women
,
"
he
growled
back
in
mock
disgust
,
"
they
're
always
late
.
"
The
Hercules
made
one
more
pass
to
drop
the
second
and
final
target
flare
.
They
headed
for
Titron
.
As
it
grew
gradually
nearer
,
and
larger
,
they
soon
found
it
towering
over
them
-
a
mighty
steel
fortress
.
A
fortress
that
contained
-
what
?
The
mystery
was
in
all
of
their
thoughts
as
silently
and
grimly
they
came
alongside
.
Perhaps
a
Sleeping
Beauty
,
mused
Eugene
Forster
.
He
was
nearer
to
the
truth
than
he
could
have
ever
known
.
Only
the
sleep
was
over
.
Scanning
the
deck
railing
,
Delaney
could
see
no
movement
as
he
raised
the
pistol
grip
launcher
,
adjusting
the
length
of
burn
.
The
timing
in
the
heavy
swell
had
to
be
carefully
judged
.
As
the
boat
rammed
the
steel
plates
,
fabric
ripping
as
it
was
dragged
up
against
the
rough
barnacled
side
,
he
fired
.
With
an
almost
lazy
climb
the
solid
fuel
missile
,
grapple
irons
extending
as
it
left
the
short
barrel
,
reached
its
zenith
and
fell
back
with
a
clang
,
hooking
on
to
the
deck
railing
.
Even
as
Delaney
hauled
the
line
tight
,
with
his
Uzi
slung
across
his
back
,
he
began
to
walk
up
the
steel
wall
.
Lawton
at
the
other
end
of
the
assault
boat
fired
.
His
grapple
connected
and
he
began
to
follow
.
Before
he
reached
the
top
,
Delaney
paused
,
and
holding
with
his
legs
,
unslung
the
Uzi
and
brought
it
to
one-handed
readiness
.
At
eye
level
he
scanned
the
deck
.
The
red
light
from
the
nearly
spent
flare
threw
giant
shadows
;
black
,
impenetrable
,
utterly
concealing
a
possible
enemy
.
Lawton
joined
him
,
his
own
machine
gun
at
the
ready
.
Together
they
scaled
the
remaining
rope
,
rolling
over
the
railing
and
falling
flat
on
to
the
deck
with
practised
ease
,
short
stubby
muzzles
of
the
Uzis
weaving
and
probing
the
long
narrow
passage
.
Nothing
moved
.
Lawton
covered
as
Delaney
raised
himself
,
wriggling
forward
into
the
nearest
pocket
of
shadow
,
as
Forster
and
Silk
came
up
like
weird
,
black
sea
creatures
that
slithered
silently
over
the
rail
and
into
the
nearest
cover
of
darkness
.
Grant
brought
up
the
rear
,
using
his
arms
only
to
haul
himself
up
the
rope
.
No
commands
were
necessary
,
the
attack
already
planned
.
Delaney
moved
forward
,
keeping
to
the
side
of
the
superstructure
,
intent
on
the
stairway
leading
to
the
next
deck
,
and
finally
the
bridge
.
Only
Forster
and
Silk
followed
,
Lawton
staying
to
assist
Nell
bring
up
the
extra
combat
kit
that
they
would
now
recover
from
the
assault
boat
.
Grant
guarded
their
rear
-
the
work
assigned
to
anyone
disabled
.
They
moved
warily
,
scuttling
forward
,
overlapping
each
other
,
black
wraith-like
phantoms
moving
as
a
single
entity
,
its
rhythm
known
to
them
as
"
house-laundering
"
-
engaging
the
enemy
at
close
quarters
.
There
were
six
decks
to
the
level
of
the
wheelhouse
.
In
that
time
they
saw
no
movement
,
no
living
or
dead
person
,
no
sign
of
violence
;
nothing
,
but
the
ordered
emptiness
of
a
darkened
and
dead
ship
.
"
It
's
spooky
,
"
Forster
said
,
finally
breaking
the
silence
.
But
nobody
answered
.
They
arrived
at
the
sliding
door
entrance
to
the
bridge
.
Silk
flattened
himself
beside
the
steel
door
,
Delaney
and
Forster
priming
stun
grenades
.
The
fuses
were
six
second
ones
.
After
a
count
of
three
,
soundlessly
checked
by
Delaney
with
his
arm
,
Silk
heaved
back
on
the
door
as
they
lobbed
them
in
.
There
followed
an
intense
double
flash
,
the
explosions
sounding
like
thousand
pound
bombs
.
Anyone
inside
would
be
temporarily
blinded
,
momentarily
stunned
,
unless
they
were
trained
personnel
and
had
taken
precautions
.
But
Silk
was
already
inside
,
hunched
down
low
,
Uzi
searching
for
targets
.
Delaney
and
Forster
were
close
behind
.
In
the
cordite-reeking
interior
loomed
dim
and
unfamiliar
shapes
.
Silk
moved
very
slowly
,
deliberately
,
pausing
with
each
step
,
like
a
stalking
tiger
.
The
others
keened
themselves
for
any
sound
,
for
any
indication
of
anyone
responding
to
Silk
's
movement
-
the
clink
of
a
grenade
pin
,
the
withering
blast
of
a
machine
gun
.
Nothing
happened
.
Silk
moved
again
,
outflanked
a
control
console
,
nestling
down
beside
it
as
Delaney
took
over
the
lead
.
Delaney
was
leaving
the
cover
of
a
vent
pipe
when
it
happened
.
There
was
a
scraping
and
a
clink
.
The
short
burst
from
Silk
's
Uzi
lit
up
the
bridge
in
a
flickering
light
,
showing
its
emptiness
as
the
cat
bucked
and
disintegrated
in
a
shower
of
red
pieces
.
Even
before
its
last
twitch
they
sprang
forward
,
securing
the
room
.
Silk
guarded
the
far
door
.
Delaney
played
a
torch
around
.
Everything
was
neat
.
There
was
no
sign
of
any
devastation
or
a
struggle
,
except
where
the
pool
of
light
picked
out
the
broken
,
gutted
cat
.
"
Try
the
lights
,
"
Delaney
snapped
.
There
was
a
clicking
followed
by
Forster
's
voice
.
"
No
joy
.
Everything
is
shut
down
.
"
That
same
pool
of
light
picked
out
a
half-smoked
cigar
on
the
edge
of
an
ashtray
,
a
partly
consumed
sandwich
,
and
several
mugs
of
cold
tea
.
To
one
side
was
an
open
paperback
novel
.
"
It
's
just
as
if
they
downed
tools
and
pushed
off
,
"
Forster
remarked
.
"
No
sign
of
a
struggle
.
"
Delaney
,
taking
in
the
scene
,
nodded
.
"
Right
,
"
he
said
briskly
,
"
get
the
rest
of
our
kit
up
here
-
both
of
you
.
And
Gene
-
"
Forster
paused
in
the
doorway
.
"
Watch
it
.
We
still
do
n't
know
what
it
is
we
are
up
against
,
do
we
?
"
Delaney
waited
in
the
darkness
,
listening
to
the
wind
moaning
in
the
wireless
rigging
and
battering
on
the
window
.
The
weather
was
certainly
getting
worse
.
They
had
only
just
managed
to
get
on
the
vessel
in
time
.
As
he
gazed
out
,
down
the
enormous
length
of
the
ship
,
he
could
just
make
out
the
dark
outline
against
the
lighter
sea
,
and
the
rectangular
shapes
of
the
deck-covered
containers
.
Would
they
find
the
answer
down
there
,
he
thought
,
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
ship
?
His
own
bowel
felt
uneasy
in
the
eerie
emptiness
,
emphasised
by
the
abandoned
accoutrements
of
the
missing
crew
,
all
around
him
.
It
was
like
being
the
last
man
alive
on
earth
.
When
the
others
returned
,
bringing
the
extra
equipment
,
he
took
a
field
radio
,
stepped
outside
and
began
to
transmit
to
the
Hercules
that
was
still
circling
around
above
them
somewhere
.
Immediately
he
tuned
the
set
in
,
interference
was
enormous
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
source
was
within
Titron
itself
.
Delaney
could
hear
the
Hercules
operator
respond
-
nothing
more
.
There
was
only
one
thing
he
could
do
.
Every
few
seconds
he
transmitted
the
"
successfully
aboard
"
code
.
HERON
HERON
HERON
Nell
Anderson
looked
up
as
Delaney
entered
.
She
was
attending
to
Grant
's
leg
.
"
He
wo
n't
be
very
mobile
for
some
time
,
"
she
said
.
"
It
's
a
bad
sprain
.
"
Grant
handed
him
his
personal
transceiver
to
clip
on
to
Delaney
's
webbing
.
"
They
wo
n't
work
for
the
moment
.
Too
much
interference
.
"
In
the
captain
's
cabin
behind
the
bridge
he
found
the
ship
's
log
.
It
conveyed
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
.
It
ended
abruptly
the
day
before
the
distress
call
.
"
Nothing
there
,
"
he
said
,
closing
the
book
.
Delaney
turned
aside
,
and
was
about
to
ask
Forster
if
he
'd
found
the
cargo
manifest
,
when
Nell
,
who
had
been
looking
over
his
shoulder
,
spoke
.
"
Does
n't
it
strike
you
as
odd
?
"
Puzzled
,
he
looked
back
at
her
.
"
What
?
"
She
thumped
the
discarded
log
book
with
the
back
of
her
hand
.
"
Titron
does
n't
appear
to
have
been
in
port
for
over
two
years
.
Like
a
latter-day
Flying
Dutchman
.
"
Delaney
took
the
book
from
her
and
scrutinised
it
more
carefully
.
It
was
true
.
The
ship
had
been
refuelled
and
re-provisioned
at
sea
by
fleet
auxiliaries
.
Nell
spoke
his
thoughts
out
loud
as
their
eyes
met
.
"
There
must
have
been
a
reason
for
it
,
like
not
wanting
anyone
to
know
what
was
being
carried
aboard
Titron
.
"
Delaney
finally
nailed
it
.
"
Because
what
was
on
board
was
too
dangerous
to
be
anywhere
near
land
.
Had
to
be
kept
thousands
of
miles
out
in
the
ocean
.
"
They
left
Lawton
with
Grant
to
guard
the
bridge
area
,
and
set
about
a
systematic
search
of
the
superstructure
.
"
Funny
,
but
the
radio
shack
is
usually
on
this
deck
,
"
Forster
remarked
at
the
end
of
the
room
for
these
extra
quarters
.
Seems
very
peculiar
,
though
.
"
But
as
they
descended
to
the
next
deck
,
then
to
the
one
below
,
the
reason
became
obvious
.
There
was
row
upon
row
of
rooms
and
carpeted
corridors
,
revealed
by
their
tensely-held
torches
,
the
ghostly
yellow
pools
of
light
allowing
only
the
objects
that
slid
in
and
out
of
them
to
be
examined
.
The
blackness
closed
around
,
obscuring
any
lurking
danger
.
The
rooms
were
well
furnished
,
many
with
books
and
hi-fi
equipment
.
Everywhere
there
was
evidence
of
abandoned
normality
as
though
everyone
had
put
down
what
they
had
been
doing
,
and
then
simply
vanished
;
half
finished
cups
of
coffee
,
dishevelled
beds
,
games
of
scrabble
and
cards
laid
out
,
play
suspended
.
In
fact
,
life
itself
suspended
.
Forster
shone
his
torch
on
to
a
stationary
music
turntable
.
"
Scarlatti
and
Bach
!
"
he
emphasised
.
"
Not
perhaps
the
normal
taste
you
might
expect
from
a
crew
member
.
"
Nell
was
at
a
bookshelf
,
reading
out
titles
as
the
pool
of
light
passed
over
the
volumes
.
"
Relativity
Fifty
Years
On
-
Principles
of
Organic
Chemistry
.
Not
exactly
light
reading
.
either
.
"
They
discovered
three
whole
decks
taken
up
by
cabins
alone
,
with
a
fourth
containing
a
large
dining
area
and
kitchens
.
Delaney
shook
his
head
,
unbelievingly
.
"
A
normal
crew
for
this
sort
of
ship
would
be
about
thirty-five
,
forty
at
the
most
.
Yet
there
is
cabin
space
and
facilities
for
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
.
Something
in
the
region
of
ninety
,
or
a
hundred
plus
.
And
that
on
top
of
the
crew
.
"
Unconvincingly
,
Nell
made
an
observation
.
"
Passengers
,
perhaps
?
Modern
ships
make
money
wherever
they
can
.
"
Forster
was
adamant
.
"
These
cabins
had
permanent
occupants
.
All
their
own
bits
and
pieces
.
And
they
seem
to
have
been
scientists
of
one
sort
or
another
.
"
Delaney
ran
his
finger
round
the
edge
of
his
wet
suit
face
cowl
.
"
Now
let's
get
this
straight
.
What
would
one
hundred
scientists
be
doing
out
here
,
on
a
permanent
basis
?
"
It
was
obvious
.
Yet
Connors
had
n't
even
hinted
at
it
.
Was
that
the
reason
,
Delaney
thought
,
for
that
look
in
his
eye
.
Was
he
holding
back
on
something
?
If
so
,
the
next
question
was
even
more
important
.
"
What
had
they
been
working
on
?
"
Delaney
wanted
to
hear
someone
else
say
it
.
Nell
obliged
on
both
counts
.
"
Working
obviously
on
a
project
of
some
sort
.
"
A
wave
passed
,
so
high
that
its
spray
burst
against
a
side
porthole
as
they
stared
at
each
other
.
"
Yes
,
"
Delaney
finally
said
,
hanging
on
to
a
handle
to
steady
himself
,
"
only
what
were
they
working
on
?
And
where
?
"
Silk
frowned
.
"
What
do
you
mean
by
where
?
"
Forster
explained
.
"
Were
they
just
staying
in
their
cabins
,
working
in
isolation
and
without
equipment
,
which
does
n't
seem
likely
,
or
what
other
part
of
the
ship
did
they
meet
in
?
"
Silk
's
pock-marked
face
was
caught
in
the
upward
glare
of
his
torch
,
giving
it
a
frightening
,
even
demonic
look
,
under
the
black
cowl
.
"
Must
be
in
the
hold
.
"
They
left
the
superstructure
and
moved
slowly
and
carefully
along
the
starlit
open
deck
,
the
increasing
wind
hammering
and
buffeting
at
their
bodies
.
Before
they
reached
the
towering
stack
of
containers
,
between
which
ran
innumerable
alleyways
where
no
faint
light
penetrated
,
they
came
upon
a
series
of
deck
hatches
.
Quickly
they
unfastened
the
catches
,
lifted
the
heavy
doors
,
and
shone
their
torches
down
.
A
ladder
led
into
a
huge
,
cavernous
interior
to
reveal
amazing
sight
.
It
was
as
if
they
were
in
an
aircraft
flying
over
a
modern
city
.
From
a
thick
layer
of
cloud
projected
the
tops
of
tall
buildings
.
Skyscrapers
.
The
cloud
was
a
white
,
heavier-than-air
gas
,
that
had
formed
a
definite
surface
layer
;
the
buildings
were
the
tops
of
stacked
containers
.
Forster
whistled
.
"
Was
the
gas
leaked
by
accident
,
I
wonder
?
Or
on
purpose
?
"
Delaney
stood
back
.
"
Makes
no
difference
.
We
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
Let's
get
the
gas
masks
.
"
They
donned
the
standard
issue
respirators
from
the
assault
boat
kit
.
With
large
eye-pieces
and
side
muzzles
,
and
searchlights
built
into
the
dome
,
they
looked
like
mutant
apes
.
Lawton
came
with
them
.
Nell
stayed
with
Grant
.
Delaney
swung
a
foot
on
to
the
ladder
.
"
Give
me
ten
minutes
at
the
bottom
,
"
he
said
.
"
If
I
do
n't
come
back
the
gas
mask
is
no
good
against
it
.
Or
we
need
full
NBC
suits
.
"
They
all
knew
that
some
gases
were
skin
absorbable
.
Delaney
's
weird
,
outlandish
figure
climbed
slowly
and
clumsily
down
,
rung
by
rung
.
At
the
surface
of
the
milky-looking
gas
he
paused
,
and
looked
back
up
at
the
three
masked
faces
,
conscious
all
the
while
of
the
increasing
rhythm
of
his
breathing
.
There
could
be
no
telling
if
his
mask
would
be
effective
until
it
was
too
late
.
But
there
was
no
other
way
to
find
out
.
Reflexly
,
he
took
a
deep
breath
,
and
climbed
down
further
.
Anxiously
,
they
waited
as
Delaney
's
black
figure
lowered
itself
into
the
fog
,
and
was
lost
,
bit
by
bit
,
from
view
,
suggesting
a
primordial
creature
descending
into
a
tropical
,
mist-covered
swamp
.
They
could
see
his
headlight
beam
picked
out
beneath
the
gas
layer
,
as
it
swept
the
area
,
then
lifting
up
towards
them
like
a
searchlight
cutting
through
cloud
.
Inside
the
cloud
it
was
not
so
dense
,
and
large
particles
,
like
wisps
of
white
tissue
,
drifted
in
the
column
of
brightness
of
the
beam
of
his
headlight
.
He
was
standing
now
on
the
steel
floor
,
the
corner
of
the
first
container
some
twenty
feet
away
.
Delaney
sank
down
and
waited
,
all
the
while
listening
to
his
breathing
,
and
wondering
.
The
power
of
the
mind
-
of
the
terrified
mind
-
over
the
body
,
he
mused
.
Five
minutes
later
he
had
gone
in
,
his
grotesquely
helmeted
head
rose
from
the
layer
of
mist
,
to
wave
them
down
.
The
rows
and
rows
of
containers
,
stacked
three
,
four
and
five
high
,
were
laid
out
in
neat
uniformity
,
forming
a
maze
of
passageways
.
Delaney
tried
his
transceiver
.
Within
the
confines
of
the
steel
hull
the
interference
was
less
.
He
adjusted
the
earpiece
underneath
his
cowl
.
"
If
anybody
feels
funny
-
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
-
report
immediately
.
"
Silk
's
voice
,
metallic
,
distorted
,
crackled
in
his
ear
.
"
Take
a
hell
of
a
time
to
search
all
these
,
wo
n't
it
?
"
Lawton
loomed
up
and
stood
beside
him
.
"
Ca
n't
see
your
laboratory
.
"
Delaney
pointed
at
one
of
two
major
alleyways
.
"
Could
be
at
the
other
end
.
You
take
Silk
,
and
go
that
way
.
I
'll
go
with
Forster
.
We
'll
meet
at
the
other
end
.
"
Lawton
nodded
,
the
light
reflecting
on
his
eyepiece
.
As
the
two
figures
moved
away
,
the
searching
beams
were
slowly
reduced
by
the
fog
until
just
the
sources
glowed
yellow
.
Then
nothingness
.
Delaney
signalled
Forster
to
follow
and
made
his
way
down
the
other
corridor
.
Unlike
the
passageways
in
the
superstructure
the
area
they
were
moving
down
was
more
unnerving
,
especially
in
the
reduced
visibility
.
Above
them
there
was
no
roof
,
just
the
swirling
gas
with
,
in
places
,
shorter
stacking
giving
ledges
.
Every
thirty
feet
or
so
there
was
a
crossway
,
a
dark
corner
to
be
approached
warily
.
The
storm
outside
was
beginning
to
rage
,
the
steel
floor
rising
and
falling
,
and
the
containers
creaking
uneasily
.
The
blackness
was
absolute
beyond
their
beams
.
Forster
paused
,
caught
Delaney
by
the
arm
,
and
pointed
.
"
Look
.
"
On
the
side
of
the
nearest
container
was
a
skull
and
crossbones
.
Delaney
added
his
own
light
beam
.
Serial
numbers
followed
.
Nothing
more
.
"
What
did
they
say
the
cargo
was
?
"
Forster
asked
,
his
voice
metallic
.
Delaney
shook
his
head
.
"
They
did
n't
,
"
he
said
ironically
.
They
moved
on
,
down
the
cathedral-like
space
,
soaring
columns
that
dwarfed
them
disappearing
into
the
swirling
mist
.
In
the
echoing
corridors
the
booming
of
the
heavy
sea
formed
a
constant
background
.
Inside
the
mask
,
Delaney
began
to
sweat
.
It
was
hot
and
clammy
,
accentuated
by
the
constant
pain
of
keeping
his
body
at
critical
pitch
,
ready
for
instant
action
.
It
seemed
to
go
on
for
ever
,
until
the
far-off
staccato
bursts
of
a
Uzi
cut
into
the
surrealistic
scene
like
a
surgeon
's
knife
.
They
froze
,
listening
as
another
burst
followed
the
first
.
Swiftly
,
Forster
and
Delaney
moved
into
action
.
They
took
the
nearest
passage
in
the
same
direction
,
snapping
off
the
torches
and
moving
by
touch
alone
,
eyes
straining
in
the
swirling
gas
,
tensed
for
the
figures
that
could
be
the
fleeing
enemy
-
or
Lawton
and
Silk
falling
back
.
Confusion
.
It
had
killed
more
than
one
of
Delaney
's
friends
,
in
a
smoke
and
gas-filled
embassy
room
;
and
a
night
time
brush
in
the
Falklands
-
a
tragic
clash
of
SAS
and
SBS
.
Out
of
the
fog
came
a
figure
in
black
.
Delaney
's
Uzi
zeroed
in
,
pressure
increased
on
the
trigger
.
In
the
nick
of
time
he
saw
the
yellow
triangular
patch
on
the
shoulder
.
It
was
Lawton
.
Delaney
caught
him
by
the
arm
.
"
Something
-
"
Lawton
managed
breathlessly
,
"
-
came
this
way
-
did
n't
you
see
it
?
"
Delaney
shook
his
head
.
"
No
.
Where
's
Silk
?
"
"
Trying
to
outflank
it
,
I
expect
.
"
Frustrated
,
Delaney
shook
Lawton
by
the
arm
.
"
What
do
you
mean
by
it
?
"
Behind
the
mask
,
Lawton
looked
grey
,
his
face
pinched
and
hollow-eyed
.
"
Only
saw
a
dim
outline
,
really
.
Huge
man
-
seemed
over
ten
feet
tall
.
Must
have
been
a
shadow
distortion
-
"
Before
he
could
say
more
Delaney
's
head
jerked
as
the
transceiver
speaker
behind
his
ear
roared
with
static
-
and
a
scream
.
They
all
heard
it
,
from
their
radios
,
from
the
echoing
corridors
,
followed
by
a
long
burst
from
a
Uzi
that
ended
in
a
muffled
slowing
,
as
though
it
had
been
smothered
to
a
halt
.
But
the
scream
seemed
to
go
on
and
on
,
rooting
them
to
the
spot
.
When
it
gurgled
and
died
it
left
a
silence
deeper
than
before
.
Forster
found
his
voice
.
"
Christ
Almighty
!
That
was
Silk
.
"
Delaney
,
moving
fast
,
snapped
on
his
torch
.
"
This
way
.
"
With
their
combined
torches
flooding
the
corridor
with
light
they
moved
fast
and
instinctively
.
"
There
!
"
Lawton
saw
it
first
.
Black
,
wet
patches
and
something
twisted
lying
in
the
midst
of
it
.
They
knew
without
any
shadow
of
doubt
what
the
patches
were
.
As
they
drew
closer
,
they
could
see
that
the
sides
of
the
surrounding
containers
were
covered
with
a
gleaming
wetness
,
spattered
to
a
height
a
few
feet
above
their
heads
.
It
was
blood
.
As
they
stood
shining
their
torches
down
on
the
twisted
bits
of
metal
,
they
saw
it
was
the
mangled
remains
of
a
Uzi
.
And
they
knew
then
where
the
blood
had
come
from
.
From
Silk
.
Forster
's
voice
was
incredulous
as
he
swung
his
torch
around
in
a
wide
arc
.
"
What
the
hell
has
happened
to
him
?
"
Grimy
,
Delaney
touched
the
twisted
metal
barrel
of
the
Uzi
with
his
foot
.
"
More
to
the
point
,
what
man
has
the
strength
to
do
this
?
"
His
eyes
found
those
of
Lawton
's
.
The
man
was
tough
.
He
would
n't
have
been
a
part
of
G9
otherwise
.
Yet
in
those
eyes
he
could
see
fear
.
Fundamental
,
animal
fear
.
They
searched
for
over
an
hour
,
following
at
first
some
vague
footprints
in
the
smudged
,
dark
liquid
.
But
they
petered
out
in
the
maze
of
corridors
.
There
was
no
trace
of
Silk
.
No
response
from
his
two-way
radio
.
"
Dead
or
alive
,
he
's
got
to
be
somewhere
.
"
Forster
was
restless
,
not
unlike
a
caged
tiger
,
as
he
crossed
and
re-crossed
the
wheelhouse
.
"
He
ca
n't
have
just
disappeared
,
"
Nell
said
.
"
He
must
be
in
one
of
the
containers
down
there
.
"
Delaney
turned
from
the
rain
trickling
down
the
window
.
"
We
'll
do
what
we
can
,
but
let's
not
forget
we
are
here
to
secure
the
ship
,
and
the
best
place
to
do
that
is
from
here
.
We
ca
n't
afford
to
get
cut
off
and
pinned
down
in
the
hold
.
"
When
nobody
spoke
he
broke
the
accusing
silence
.
"
Gene
,
let's
go
and
find
that
lost
radio
room
.
Maybe
we
can
beat
the
interference
;
get
more
information
on
what
's
been
going
on
out
here
.
"
"
If
they
would
n't
tell
us
the
first
time
,
why
should
they
do
so
now
?
"
Nell
said
,
looking
drawn
,
tired
,
with
dark
rings
forming
under
her
eyes
.
Delaney
remembered
again
that
look
in
Connors
'
eye
;
and
knew
Nell
was
right
.
But
he
said
nothing
,
and
as
he
led
the
way
,
Forster
followed
him
.
It
was
slow
work
,
moving
all
the
time
with
extreme
caution
,
just
the
two
of
them
,
their
beams
of
light
,
the
ever-present
blackness
,
and
the
half-seen
outlines
just
beyond
the
light
.
They
checked
every
door
and
cupboard
in
the
superstructure
.
It
was
only
when
they
came
out
of
the
rearmost
door
and
found
a
temporary
hut
facing
them
with
Radio
Room
marked
on
the
door
,
that
they
realised
why
they
had
n't
found
it
the
first
time
.
At
a
nod
from
Delaney
,
Forster
gently
turned
the
handle
.
Then
Delaney
rushed
forward
,
shoulder
first
,
bursting
the
door
open
as
he
rolled
in
,
with
Forster
's
light
beam
sweeping
way
ahead
of
him
.
The
room
was
empty
.
They
stared
around
them
in
disbelief
.
Although
Grant
was
the
expert
of
the
group
,
they
both
knew
enough
to
realise
that
the
equipment
stacked
around
was
sophisticated
,
and
far
too
much
for
Titron
if
she
had
been
but
an
ordinary
container
ship
.
And
by
now
they
knew
she
was
not
.
A
red
light
above
the
panel
showed
the
equipment
was
on
,
supplied
by
automatic
power
,
probably
from
batteries
.
Forster
moved
further
into
the
room
.
"
Looks
more
like
the
communications
centre
of
a
nuclear
sub
.
"
They
searched
carefully
until
they
were
satisfied
that
the
sensitive
area
was
not
armed
for
self-destruction
,
as
many
were
.
Delaney
finally
thumbed
the
button
on
the
speaker
set
.
The
static
roared
out
from
the
earphones
,
stronger
than
ever
.
He
held
the
headset
away
from
him
,
using
only
one
ear
as
they
tried
several
wavelengths
.
It
was
hopeless
.
Delaney
gave
up
,
shutting
it
off
and
swivelling
out
of
the
chair
.
"
Something
else
is
running
on
emergency
power
and
producing
that
interference
.
Let's
go
and
find
out
what
it
is
.
"
Forster
held
up
his
transceiver
.
"
We
could
try
tracking
it
with
this
.
"
They
went
outside
,
Forster
turning
around
with
the
set
switched
on
,
and
finding
the
direction
where
the
static
was
the
strongest
.
"
It
's
coming
from
the
stern
.
"
They
worked
their
way
past
the
starboard
lifeboat
,
and
down
another
short
ladder
.
Against
the
lighter
foaming
sea
was
just
visible
a
large
windowless
domed
structure
.
They
paused
,
weighing
it
up
.
"
Radar
?
"
Forster
questioned
.
"
Or
some
sort
of
electronic
counter
measure
?
"
Delaney
nodded
.
"
It
was
n't
obvious
on
the
photograph
they
showed
me
.
"
As
they
drew
nearer
they
became
conscious
of
a
high
pitched
humming
noise
.
Forster
tried
the
transceiver
.
The
interference
was
total
.
They
walked
around
the
outside
.
There
was
no
visible
way
in
.
Forster
scratched
at
a
riveted
panel
without
success
.
"
Must
be
reached
from
another
deck
level
.
Underneath
.
"
Delaney
nodded
,
sinking
to
his
haunches
.
From
one
of
his
pouches
he
took
what
looked
like
a
package
of
grey
plasticine
.
Removing
the
wrapping
he
began
pressing
the
plastic
explosive
tightly
around
the
rivet
line
.
Forster
grinned
.
"
Going
to
blow
it
up
?
"
Delaney
did
n't
look
up
,
but
carried
on
with
his
preparations
.
"
Those
people
at
the
MOD
have
n't
played
fair
with
us
,
so
I
owe
them
nothing
.
"
Forster
chuckled
.
"
You
're
probably
going
to
set
the
taxpayer
back
a
couple
of
million
,
unless
these
things
are
made
of
plate
steel
.
"
Delaney
inserted
the
detonator
pin
attached
to
the
timer
,
primed
the
circuit
,
and
set
ten
seconds
of
fuse
.
Legging
it
,
they
got
down
behind
cover
just
as
the
last
second
ran
out
.
The
night
was
split
by
an
orange
flash
that
lit
the
stem
of
the
ship
.
It
was
followed
by
a
hammer
blow
that
echoed
like
thunder
through
the
steel
hulk
.
Dense
,
acrid
smoke
swirled
unseen
in
the
night
wind
,
a
choking
mixture
of
burning
chemical
and
insulation
material
that
forced
them
to
re-don
their
respirators
.
They
moved
back
nearer
,
getting
to
windward
.
The
domed
structure
was
wrecked
,
smashed
open
at
one
side
like
an
eggshell
.
Inside
,
the
blaze
was
already
fierce
,
fanned
by
the
high
wind
,
the
heat
building
up
so
that
they
could
see
the
metal
beginning
to
glow
.
Forster
's
grotesque
rubber
mask
nodded
at
the
inferno
.
"
Aluminium
.
"
Delaney
agreed
.
"
Now
let's
give
this
a
try
.
"
He
pulled
off
his
mask
and
used
his
transceiver
to
call
the
bridge
.
Nell
answered
loud
and
clear
.
"
What
the
hell
is
happening
back
there
?
"
"
We
're
having
a
firework
party
,
"
Delaney
drawled
,
"
with
a
bit
of
suspicious
equipment
.
No
contact
-
human
or
otherwise
.
"
His
attempt
at
a
joke
misfired
.
"
We
're
going
back
to
the
wireless
room
.
See
if
you
can
raise
Silk
on
his
radio
.
He
may
still
be
alive
.
"
It
seemed
foolish
,
such
a
suggestion
.
There
had
been
so
much
blood
,
but
-
Forster
pointed
at
the
fire
.
"
What
about
that
?
"
"
Nothing
we
can
do
but
check
it
now
and
then
,
"
Delaney
said
,
shrugging
.
"
If
the
worst
happens
and
it
spreads
I
reckon
help
should
have
arrived
before
it
gets
serious
.
"
They
turned
back
into
the
swirling
smoke
,
and
up
the
ladder
to
the
superstructure
,
regaining
the
door
to
the
wireless
hut
.
Delaney
went
in
,
and
pulled
up
as
if
he
had
been
hit
with
a
magnum
at
close
range
.
Facing
him
was
a
man
-
white
,
shaking
and
terrified
.
Forster
crouched
in
.
"
Jesus
!
"
The
man
screamed
,
leapt
back
,
smashing
over
a
chair
.
It
was
then
that
they
saw
the
grenade
in
his
hand
.
Gradually
,
Delaney
opened
his
arms
,
finally
holding
his
Uzi
wide
from
his
body
.
"
Easy
,
"
he
said
quietly
,
"
we
're
here
to
help
you
.
"
Forster
straightened
up
slowly
,
moving
gently
aside
so
that
they
were
not
a
grouped
target
.
Whimpering
,
the
man
cringed
,
hands
shaking
as
he
raised
the
grenade
in
front
of
him
,
one
hand
on
the
pin
.
Delaney
's
eyes
never
left
those
of
the
man
as
cautiously
he
tried
again
.
"
We
're
friends
.
Sent
from
London
.
There
's
nothing
to
worry
about
.
Whatever
happened
here
is
over
now
.
We
can
take
you
away
.
"
Forster
,
still
inching
aside
,
murmured
sympathetically
.
"
What
's
been
going
on
?
Pretty
rough
,
was
it
?
"
The
man
was
sweating
profusely
,
and
suddenly
a
dark
stain
spread
on
the
front
of
his
trousers
.
Delaney
and
Forster
exchanged
quick
,
worried
glances
,
for
the
man
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
total
derangement
.
Delaney
realised
that
their
respirators
were
dehumanising
and
frightening
,
thus
preventing
his
facial
expressions
from
communicating
confidence
.
He
began
to
move
his
hand
towards
his
mask
.
"
We
're
men
from
the
Navy
.
You
'll
be
all
right
now
.
I
'm
going
to
take
my
respirator
off
.
You
'll
see
.
"
As
his
hand
closed
on
the
rubber
border
,
the
man
appeared
to
steady
,
staring
fixedly
as
if
fascinated
by
the
spectacle
.
Delaney
did
nothing
suddenly
.
He
pulled
the
mask
forward
slowly
,
relying
for
his
protection
on
Forster
while
he
was
temporarily
blinded
.
Hair
ruffled
,
his
face
came
clear
.
Delaney
smiled
encouragingly
.
"
There
-
"
The
man
screamed
,
yanked
out
the
pin
and
threw
the
grenade
.
The
brown
egg
struck
the
wall
behind
Delaney
's
head
with
a
clang
and
whirled
back
to
bounce
on
the
top
of
the
radio
bench
.
As
Delaney
and
Forster
hit
the
deck
they
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
crazed
man
going
for
it
again
.
Still
rolling
,
Forster
shot
from
the
hip
.
Instantly
,
the
reaching
figure
became
a
puppet
,
jerking
backwards
in
a
pirouette
that
suddenly
collapsed
with
the
abrupt
finality
of
cut
strings
.
The
brown
egg
spun
on
its
own
axis
,
became
a
bead
of
intense
brilliant
yellow
that
immediately
filled
the
room
.
The
explosion
blew
out
the
windows
and
door
,
and
shattered
the
banks
of
units
,
sucking
up
a
whirling
storm
of
glass
and
wires
that
whiplashed
their
arm-covered
heads
.
It
took
seconds
for
the
last
bit
to
drop
.
The
silence
was
deafening
.
They
got
cautiously
to
their
feet
,
surveying
the
wreckage
and
carnage
.
Delaney
looked
bitterly
at
the
shambles
.
"
It
's
ripped
the
guts
out
of
the
radio
.
"
"
And
him
,
"
Forster
nodded
,
looking
down
at
the
shattered
,
eviscerated
remains
of
the
man
.
Nell
Anderson
,
Grant
and
Lawton
listened
while
events
were
recounted
.
Delaney
appealed
to
her
.
"
Honestly
,
Nell
,
we
did
nothing
sudden
.
It
was
as
if
he
was
utterly
mad
.
Frightened
beyond
any
recall
.
"
Forster
nodded
.
"
Maybe
we
should
have
jumped
him
,
then
perhaps
you
could
have
injected
him
with
something
.
"
She
shrugged
non-commitally
.
"
What
could
do
that
,
"
Delaney
wanted
to
know
,
"
to
drive
a
man
so
insane
?
"
His
voice
trailed
off
helplessly
.
Nell
looked
thoughtful
.
"
Before
we
came
aboard
this
ship
I
was
thinking
of
the
possibilities
.
"
Delaney
eyed
her
speculatively
.
"
Ergot
poisoning
.
It
would
explain
why
the
crew
were
not
present
-
had
possibly
jumped
overboard
as
mental
disintegration
deepened
.
"
"
You
're
saying
that
this
crazed
man
fitted
the
picture
?
"
"
He
would
,
indeed
,
"
Nell
confirmed
.
"
It
is
one
of
the
reasons
advanced
for
the
solution
to
the
Marie
Celeste
mystery
,
that
the
flour
might
have
been
contaminated
with
ergot
.
It
produces
weird
hallucinations
.
Several
so-called
religious
visions
of
the
Middle
Ages
have
since
been
attributed
to
it
.
"
Her
face
became
troubled
.
"
Only
-
"
Delaney
grimaced
.
"
Only
what
,
Nell
?
"
She
shook
her
head
slowly
,
just
the
once
.
"
It
does
n't
explain
our
mysterious
man
in
the
hold
.
"
There
was
a
depressing
silence
.
"
An
hallucination
did
n't
kill
Barry
Silk
,
did
it
?
Theo
saw
an
exceptionally
tall
figure
.
And
we
have
n't
drunk
or
eaten
anything
from
on
board
.
"
Lawton
shuffled
uneasily
,
but
did
n't
try
and
contradict
her
or
go
back
on
his
description
.
"
The
gas
?
"
asked
Grant
.
Nell
shook
her
head
.
"
Nobody
else
experience
any
ill-effects
.
"
"
What
she
did
n't
say
and
was
too
embarrassed
to
talk
about
was
an
uncanny
feeling
that
she
had
only
recently
become
aware
of
,
but
now
realised
had
been
growing
in
her
ever
since
she
had
set
foot
on
Titron
.
It
was
as
if
a
crumbling
away
of
the
carefully
built-up
layers
of
education
,
technical
training
,
so-called
civilisation
,
was
taking
place
,
leaving
her
stripped
of
all
her
carefully
acquired
adult
assurance
.
Deep
inside
her
had
been
awakened
a
nameless
,
primitive
fear
that
at
first
had
ached
away
in
the
background
,
but
slowly
had
grown
more
evident
,
more
pronounced
,
like
a
stared-at
,
half-perceived
figure
in
the
shadowy
corner
of
a
bedroom
.
The
same
feeling
when
,
as
a
girl
,
she
had
woken
from
a
nightmare
,
and
sat
in
the
dark
,
not
sure
if
she
was
really
awake
;
really
alone
.
Titron
she
knew
,
with
female
,
celtic
instinct
,
was
truly
evil
.
And
the
nightmare
was
only
just
beginning
.
Dawn
came
slowly
,
uncertainly
,
with
first
,
the
white
foam
on
the
huge
breaking
waves
becoming
more
noticeable
.
It
was
a
false
dawn
,
replaced
soon
after
by
a
now
starless
night
that
was
blacker
than
the
previous
hours
.
True
dawn
came
as
a
dirty
yellow
streak
in
the
east
that
slowly
lost
its
colour
as
it
spread
into
a
cold
grey
,
filled
with
racing
clouds
.
Delaney
had
taken
the
first
watch
with
Forster
.
He
reviewed
the
situation
as
he
gazed
unseeingly
out
of
the
rain-lashed
windows
,
at
the
huge
bows
of
Titron
,
as
she
wallowed
helplessly
in
the
heaving
seas
.
He
had
suffered
casualties
-
one
man
missing
,
presumed
dead
,
another
partially
disabled
.
Below
decks
lurked
something
that
at
the
moment
defied
the
imagination
.
The
only
crew
member
they
had
located
had
been
totally
insane
-
with
fear
.
Delaney
had
been
told
to
hold
Titron
for
forty-eight
hours
.
That
he
reckoned
he
could
still
do
.
The
casualty
rate
so
far
was
no
more
than
might
have
been
expected
from
the
hazardous
nature
of
the
operation
,
and
although
he
could
not
,
in
all
honesty
,
say
he
was
in
command
of
the
whole
ship
,
he
at
least
held
the
strategic
upper
hand
.
Whoever
,
or
whatever
was
in
the
hold
seemed
unwilling
or
unable
-
they
had
battened
down
the
hatch
once
more
-
to
do
battle
in
the
open
.
As
yet
.
But
what
really
was
to
happen
after
the
forty-eight
hours
?
He
had
uneasily
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
Connors
had
been
more
than
vague
,
had
actually
held
back
vital
information
.
Or
did
n't
he
or
anybody
back
in
Whitehall
know
the
full
truth
?
There
was
something
very
odd
-
disturbing
-
about
Titron
,
a
ship
that
wandered
the
world
's
seas
,
never
making
landfall
,
carrying
its
dark
secret
forever
in
its
belly
.
Delaney
frowned
.
Now
why
had
he
thought
-
forever
?
When
he
awoke
,
Delaney
found
Nell
on
watch
outside
the
wheelhouse
,
hair
blowing
wildly
in
the
sea-filled
wind
,
binoculars
searching
the
storm-tossed
horizon
.
He
stood
beside
her
,
clutching
the
rail
.
"
You
OK
?
"
he
asked
.
Nell
tried
to
smile
.
"
Better
for
some
fresh
air
.
"
They
stood
in
silence
as
she
quartered
the
horizon
again
.
"
Anything
?
"
he
asked
.
She
lowered
the
binoculars
.
"
I
keep
seeing
a
periscope
-
"
she
semi-joked
.
Delaney
was
suddenly
alert
.
"
Where
?
"
he
said
,
urgently
.
Nell
shook
her
head
ruefully
.
"
Forget
it
.
It
's
me
-
really
.
"
Delaney
was
unconvinced
as
he
held
out
his
hand
.
"
Let
me
make
sure
.
"
Nell
unslung
the
binoculars
and
handed
them
to
him
.
"
Probably
a
shark
.
I
'm
not
at
my
best
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
"
"
First
thing
?
"
He
grunted
as
he
took
the
binoculars
.
"
It
's
ten
o'clock
.
Now
,
where
do
I
look
?
"
Nell
pointed
.
Delaney
focussed
in
on
the
waves
piling
up
tightly
one
behind
the
other
,
like
a
huge
wall
in
the
foreshortened
view
.
He
spent
several
minutes
observing
,
but
saw
nothing
.
He
handed
the
binoculars
back
to
Nell
.
"
Satisfied
?
"
Delaney
gave
a
weary
smile
.
"
Ca
n't
be
too
careful
.
I
think
this
dirty
weather
will
keep
any
nosey-parker
down
deep
.
"
She
turned
her
back
on
the
endless
waves
.
"
What
's
going
to
happen
now
,
John
?
"
"
I
've
got
Lawton
and
Forster
checking
on
the
stern
fire
.
Grant
's
trying
to
raise
Silk
,
Whitehall
,
or
anybody
;
so
far
without
success
.
When
the
others
are
back
we
'll
have
a
council
of
war
.
"
"
John
,
"
she
said
with
a
sudden
urgency
that
stopped
abruptly
.
"
Yes
?
"
he
prompted
,
puzzled
.
Nell
,
disturbed
,
turned
away
from
him
,
to
face
back
towards
the
sea
.
"
I
'm
afraid
.
"
Delaney
tried
his
best
not
to
show
his
surprise
.
Nell
Anderson
afraid
?
Less
than
twenty-four
hours
ago
he
'd
have
laughed
,
put
his
pension
on
the
fact
that
there
was
n't
a
man
alive
that
she
was
afraid
of
.
She
read
his
thoughts
.
"
I
do
n't
mean
in
the
ordinary
sense
.
I
'm
afraid
for
us
all
.
Afraid
for
humanity
.
"
She
frowned
and
smacked
the
rail
.
"
God
!
that
sounds
stupid
.
"
Nell
's
chin
came
up
challengingly
.
"
I
think
you
know
what
I
mean
.
"
Delaney
stonewalled
.
"
Do
I
?
You
tell
me
.
"
She
took
a
deep
breath
,
bracing
herself
to
put
it
into
words
,
risk
the
ridicule
and
embarrassment
of
revealing
her
growing
fears
.
"
Everything
we
've
so
far
found
out
about
Titron
is
weird
.
"
She
enumerated
the
points
on
her
fingers
.
"
One
.
A
ship
that
never
enters
harbour
.
Two
.
Has
some
sort
of
scientific
force
aboard
-
but
we
ca
n't
find
where
they
worked
.
Three
.
The
mystery
of
what
's
happened
to
them
.
And
four
.
If
that
was
n't
enough
,
what
in
heaven
's
name
is
that
lethal
figure
running
around
in
the
hold
,
like
some
latter-day
Frankenstein
's
monster
?
"
Delaney
's
face
was
expressionless
.
"
I
agree
,
Nell
,
but
what
exactly
are
you
leading
up
to
?
"
She
looked
angry
with
herself
.
"
I
'm
not
sure
,
in
the
long
run
.
But
I
think
we
should
find
out
everything
we
can
.
"
Delaney
faced
the
sea
himself
.
"
Why
?
"
he
questioned
.
"
It
's
not
in
our
brief
.
All
we
've
been
asked
to
do
is
secure
this
ship
until
help
arrives
;
which
should
n't
be
longer
than
this
time
tomorrow
.
But
you
know
that
already
.
"
He
had
n't
meant
it
as
a
rebuke
,
but
Nell
flinched
.
"
I
did
n't
join
G9
in
the
expectation
of
becoming
an
unthinking
zombie
.
I
'm
still
a
member
of
the
human
race
.
"
Caught
out
by
the
tenacity
of
her
reply
,
Delaney
backed
off
.
"
Steady
!
Nobody
's
asking
you
to
be
anything
less
.
What
's
eating
you
?
"
At
first
,
angry
with
herself
for
over-reacting
,
Nell
felt
suddenly
deflated
.
She
had
n't
planned
to
approach
him
like
this
.
It
had
just
happened
.
It
was
out
in
the
open
now
,
her
thoughts
of
that
last
hour
as
she
had
kept
her
lonely
vigil
.
"
I
feel
we
should
make
it
our
duty
,
"
she
said
calmly
,
"
to
find
out
as
much
as
we
can
.
"
He
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
with
real
unease
.
Delaney
knew
what
she
was
implying
.
"
You
've
signed
the
official
secrets
act
,
Nell
,
"
he
reminded
her
gruffly
.
"
If
it
ever
came
to
it
,
you
could
n't
do
it
,
you
know
.
They
'd
hush
you
up
-
somehow
.
"
In
emphasising
the
last
word
he
wanted
her
to
realise
that
he
was
as
cynical
about
the
ultimate
behaviour
of
any
Government
Department
,
of
any
shade
of
political
persuasion
,
as
she
was
.
Probably
more
so
.
Nell
continued
to
stare
at
the
sea
for
a
very
long
time
.
Delaney
watched
her
-
watched
the
reddish
hair
playing
around
her
cheek
,
and
the
lips
that
he
suddenly
wanted
to
cover
with
his
own
.
The
urge
grew
and
grew
,
gathering
strength
from
its
own
realisation
.
Delaney
took
her
shoulders
,
and
turned
her
towards
him
.
She
thought
he
was
going
to
say
something
to
put
her
straight
.
"
I
refuse
to
-
"
she
began
defiantly
.
He
closed
his
mouth
down
around
hers
,
and
for
a
moment
she
was
too
stunned
to
react
.
Then
a
natural
aggression
kicked
in
.
Nell
's
hands
came
up
,
and
began
to
push
him
away
.
It
was
only
when
she
realised
that
she
had
n't
used
the
unarmed
combat
that
was
by
now
second
nature
to
her
,
but
was
struggling
in
a
manner
that
was
instinctive
,
that
she
stopped
.
Perplexed
,
she
closed
her
eyes
,
then
opened
them
again
to
reassure
herself
she
was
n't
dreaming
.
Finally
,
she
closed
them
once
more
.
When
they
parted
they
looked
searchingly
at
each
other
.
She
rested
her
head
on
his
chest
.
"
What
made
you
do
that
?
"
Delaney
hesitated
,
then
stroked
her
wildly-blowing
hair
,
feeling
it
fluttering
in
his
hand
,
like
a
captured
bird
.
"
It
just
came
over
me
.
I
have
a
suspicion
I
've
wanted
to
do
it
for
some
time
.
"
He
felt
her
head
give
the
merest
of
nods
.
Her
small-voiced
reply
was
all
but
lost
in
the
wind
.
"
I
'm
glad
you
did
.
"
Delaney
straightened
,
took
her
chin
and
gently
turned
her
face
back
up
to
his
.
The
kiss
was
the
slightest
brush
of
the
lips
,
but
in
its
easy
acceptance
sent
a
spasm
of
aggressive
pleasure
coursing
through
him
.
"
Come
on
,
"
he
said
briskly
.
"
Back
to
work
.
"
Lawton
and
Forster
brought
good
news
.
Both
men
were
soaking
as
Lawton
make
his
report
,
the
drops
trickling
down
their
wet
suits
.
"
The
weather
's
not
improving
,
and
with
us
wallowing
around
like
a
drunken
whale
we
've
taken
heavy
seas
over
the
stern
.
The
fire
is
nearly
out
.
"
as
if
to
underline
his
words
a
creaming
beam
wave
appeared
in
the
middle
distance
,
suddenly
becoming
apparent
that
it
was
a
freak
.
"
Mother
of
God
!
"
Lawton
did
n't
cross
himself
,
Catholic
or
not
,
but
joined
the
rest
in
finding
a
place
to
support
himself
as
the
wall
of
water
roared
silently
down
on
them
.
It
reached
Titron
.
The
solid
wall
of
water
exploded
against
the
side
of
the
ship
,
falling
inboard
in
a
white
avalanche
as
Titron
heeled
over
.
Grant
's
grip
was
broken
.
He
spun
across
the
deck
and
hit
the
far
wall
..
Before
Titron
was
fully
upright
a
second
giant
wave
fell
upon
her
.
It
roared
over
the
deck
,
detonating
against
the
stacked
containers
,
bursting
upwards
in
geysers
that
reached
hungrily
at
the
armoured
plate
glass
of
the
bridge
.
Titron
went
over
to
an
angle
of
thirty-five
degrees
.
Forster
stared
through
the
near
side
window
at
the
raging
sea
.
"
Christ
Almighty
,
"
he
yelled
,
"
this
is
bloody
dangerous
.
"
With
a
scream
of
sheering
steel
several
containers
slewed
to
one
side
,
smashing
into
each
other
like
giant
rectangular
dice
.
Lawton
struggled
over
to
Delaney
,
running
with
short
quick
steps
,
as
the
deck
came
up
again
.
"
We
've
got
to
try
and
bring
her
about
.
Get
her
head
into
it
.
"
Delaney
nodded
.
"
Help
me
with
the
wheel
.
"
Forster
made
to
join
them
.
"
What
we
need
is
engine
power
.
"
Savagely
,
as
he
passed
,
he
worked
the
handle
of
the
engine
room
telegraph
.
"
It
's
not
automatic
,
"
Lawton
shouted
.
"
It
needs
a
human
hand
at
the
other
end
.
"
Forster
had
reached
them
when
the
telegraph
repeater
rang
,
the
pointers
moved
and
came
back
to
"
start
engines
"
.
Almost
immediately
they
felt
the
vibration
in
the
deck
,
a
steady
throbbing
that
was
there
as
a
constant
background
between
the
ringing
blows
of
the
storm
.
Delaney
was
the
first
to
react
.
"
My
God
!
there
are
people
in
the
engine
room
.
Martin
,
get
them
on
the
ship
's
communicator
.
"
Grant
half
swayed
,
half
fell
to
the
inboard
telephone
,
lifting
the
speaker
close
to
his
mouth
.
"
Hello
,
engine
room
.
Who
's
there
?
Repeat
.
Who
's
there
?
"
Nothing
came
back
.
He
tried
several
times
without
success
.
Despite
their
action
with
the
wheel
thousands
more
tons
of
ocean
fell
on
to
Titron
.
"
Try
them
for
half
speed
,
"
Delaney
shouted
in
desperation
.
Forster
scrambled
along
to
the
telegraph
and
rang
the
order
.
Outside
,
another
fierce
white
explosion
of
water
burst
over
the
side
,
carried
by
the
screaming
banshee
of
a
wind
on
to
the
armoured
glass
plate
of
the
bridge
.
Grimly
they
hung
on
,
staring
at
the
graduated
circle
of
the
instrument
,
and
the
indicator
that
still
rested
at
"
start
engines
"
.
"
It
's
no
-
"
Forster
's
open
mouth
arrested
in
mid-sentence
as
the
repeater
bell
rang
out
and
the
indicators
moved
to
"
half
ahead
together
"
.
All
three
struggled
with
the
wheel
.
Titron
was
slow
to
respond
,
then
seemed
to
gather
strength
,
the
bows
turning
into
the
storm
.
The
violent
,
erratic
rolling
slowly
changed
into
a
regular
rising
and
falling
.
Staring
through
the
streaming
window
,
Nell
gritted
her
teeth
every
time
the
bows
pushed
out
over
the
top
of
a
big
wave
,
only
to
hang
in
space
before
dropping
away
into
the
sixty-odd
feet
of
the
following
trough
that
seemed
to
her
a
mile
deep
.
She
felt
,
rather
than
heard
herself
moan
,
as
they
went
down
.
When
the
bows
plunged
into
the
slate
black
water
at
the
bottom
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
would
go
on
diving
in
,
engulfed
by
the
on-rushing
sea
,
never
to
return
to
the
surface
.
Invariably
Titron
came
up
,
green
water
avalanching
into
white
that
flared
back
in
the
wind
.
They
began
to
relax
,
Delaney
and
Forster
leaving
the
wheel
to
Lawton
.
Forster
took
up
a
position
with
his
back
to
the
bows
,
wedging
himself
into
a
corner
as
Delaney
tried
the
ship
's
telephone
again
,
speaking
slowly
and
deliberately
.
"
Whoever
's
there
-
can
you
hear
me
?
We
've
come
aboard
to
help
you
.
Repeat
.
To
help
you
.
Over
.
"
It
took
them
unaware
,
chilling
their
blood
.
The
reply
,
a
weird
breathing
sound
,
and
an
unintelligible
,
totally
alien
jabbering
.
Then
it
cut
off
as
suddenly
as
it
had
started
.
The
silence
in
the
wheelhouse
was
,
if
anything
,
emphasised
by
the
storm
outside
.
"
Well
,
"
Forster
drawled
,
"
there
's
a
hand
of
some
sort
down
there
.
"
"
There
's
not
much
you
can
do
in
this
storm
.
"
Nell
Anderson
said
it
,
knowing
that
it
was
hopeless
,
that
Delaney
would
-
had
to
go
down
to
the
engine
room
.
Nothing
would
stop
him
,
yet
she
struggled
now
to
contain
the
fear
that
was
in
her
,
spreading
like
some
pernicious
cancer
.
Conscious
of
her
troubled
state
of
mind
,
Delaney
gave
her
a
quick
,
comforting
smile
,
embarrassed
that
the
others
might
instantly
pick
up
any
nuance
of
their
changed
relationship
.
"
Two
of
us
will
go
.
The
rest
stay
here
.
"
Delaney
looked
across
at
Forster
,
who
straightened
himself
up
.
"
Right
.
Let's
get
on
with
it
.
"
As
soon
as
Delaney
slid
open
the
wheelhouse
door
the
roaring
hurricane
reached
in
,
plucking
at
anything
loose
,
snapping
the
curtain
that
sectioned
off
the
chart
room
,
jingling
a
row
of
metal-clipped
notices
.
Hands
white
with
cold
,
they
struggled
along
the
gangway
and
down
the
stairs
.
As
they
reached
the
level
of
the
deck
a
wall
of
green
water
lifted
with
a
monstrous
boom
at
the
bow
then
broke
into
huge
white
columns
of
water
,
not
unlike
a
Niagara
Fall
that
carried
majestically
the
length
of
Titron
.
Delaney
and
Forster
were
engulfed
in
a
hammering
storm
of
water
that
forced
them
almost
to
their
knees
.
They
hung
on
until
the
battering
ceased
,
then
ran
,
slithering
in
the
sluicing
torrent
of
water
until
they
reached
the
hatch
that
led
below
decks
.
Delaney
nodded
,
Forster
snapped
down
the
securing
lever
and
pulled
.
Delaney
jumped
in
,
Forster
right
behind
him
,
the
steel
door
slamming
shut
with
a
clang
.
After
the
wildness
outside
,
their
ears
were
momentarily
stunned
,
the
silence
seeming
absolute
.
Then
slowly
they
heard
it
-
the
distant
rumble
of
the
30,000
hp
diesels
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
ship
.
Periodically
the
rumble
accelerated
as
the
propellers
came
clear
of
the
water
,
throbbing
like
a
heart
beat
.
And
suddenly
,
the
great
steel
hulk
was
no
longer
a
hulk
.
Titron
was
alive
.
Delaney
reached
in
his
pack
and
pulled
out
his
respirator
.
"
We
'll
wear
these
,
"
he
said
.
"
Just
in
case
.
"
They
moved
cautiously
along
a
dimly-lit
passage
until
they
reached
the
steep
narrow
ladder
that
descended
to
the
next
level
.
The
first
man
walking
down
would
be
totally
exposed
-
helpless
.
Delaney
dropped
to
his
belly
and
snake-like
began
to
descend
,
head
first
,
down
the
ladder
.
Forster
held
his
legs
,
leaving
Delaney
free
to
grip
his
Smith
and
Wesson
two-handed
,
searching
through
the
metal
steps
for
any
danger
.
There
was
none
.
He
slid
to
the
bottom
,
Forster
following
.
They
repeated
the
move
at
each
level
,
the
pulsating
roar
getting
louder
and
louder
.
Finally
,
Delaney
's
masked
black
figure
slid
down
into
an
area
that
was
wider
and
better
lit
.
It
ran
the
width
of
the
ship
and
was
full
of
machinery
.
He
dived
behind
a
storage
tank
,
covering
as
Forster
dropped
lightly
to
his
feet
and
ducked
down
beside
a
bench
.
The
noise
was
like
a
factory
.
They
carefully
scanned
the
area
,
unmoving
,
and
waiting
for
any
sign
of
life
.
Delaney
saw
Forster
nod
,
the
light
flashing
on
his
eye-pieces
.
It
was
a
steel
,
water-tight
door
.
Delaney
understood
.
He
signalled
his
understanding
.
Through
it
was
the
main
engine
room
.
As
they
began
to
move
towards
it
they
noticed
that
the
door
was
bigger
than
the
others
and
could
quite
easily
accommodate
two
men
abreast
.
Crouched
down
beside
it
,
Delaney
took
another
searching
glance
behind
him
,
at
the
lifeless
,
cluttered
room
.
Nothing
moved
.
Delaney
steadied
himself
,
holstering
the
Smith
and
Wesson
and
unslinging
the
Uzi
.
He
nodded
to
his
companion
.
Forster
smashed
down
the
locking
lever
,
and
pulled
for
all
his
worth
.
Delaney
lurched
forward
,
unable
to
stop
himself
shouldering
the
door
hard
.
It
had
n't
moved
.
Quickly
,
Forster
worked
the
bar
again
,
and
again
.
But
the
door
remained
firmly
shut
.
Forster
thumbed
his
radio
.
"
The
mechanism
's
jammed
.
"
Delaney
straightened
up
and
searched
around
.
He
found
a
heavy
wrench
and
hammered
on
the
door
.
There
was
no
discernible
response
.
He
hammered
again
,
pulling
off
his
mask
,
and
shouting
.
"
Open
up
!
We
're
here
to
help
.
"
The
pulsating
roar
of
the
engines
formed
a
steady
background
as
Delaney
kept
up
a
barrage
on
the
door
.
Finally
,
following
suit
,
Forster
took
off
his
mask
.
He
frowned
.
"
What
's
that
funny
smell
?
"
Puzzled
,
Delaney
looked
at
him
.
"
What
are
you
talking
about
?
"
"
Ca
n't
you
detect
it
?
A
sort
of
dry
,
musty
o
dour
.
"
Irritated
,
Delaney
brushed
Forster
aside
.
"
Come
on
,
"
he
said
briskly
.
"
We
'll
-
"
He
caught
sight
of
the
small
perspex
circle
,
bulging
like
a
half-an-inch
magnifying
glass
,
set
in
the
steel
to
one
side
.
It
was
a
tiny
observation
port
designed
to
give
a
view
in
an
emergency
of
level
of
water
or
degree
of
fire
in
the
engine
room
beyond
.
He
peered
through
.
There
was
a
whiteness
,
with
thousands
of
tiny
red
lines
meandering
outwards
like
fine
tributaries
of
a
river
.
It
reminded
him
of
a
veined
glass
marble
he
had
once
owned
as
a
boy
.
And
in
the
middle
was
yet
another
marble
-
dark
,
gleaming
,
and
full
of
mysterious
moving
depths
.
He
stared
at
it
,
puzzled
,
deciding
it
was
pulsating
,
with
red
lines
swelling
and
diminishing
in
the
self-same
rhythm
;
tentacles
that
throbbed
with
the
heart
beat
of
the
central
creature
.
The
shiny
black
central
sphere
flicked
suddenly
to
one
side
,
jumped
as
if
touched
,
like
an
animalcule
at
the
bottom
of
a
microscope
imprisoned
by
the
tension
of
a
viscous
fluid
.
And
in
that
moment
he
saw
the
shape
formed
by
the
moving
depths
.
It
was
the
reflection
of
his
own
face
.
He
knew
what
he
was
looking
at
.
It
was
an
eye
.
Delaney
was
transfixed
,
staring
back
like
a
rabbit
before
a
snake
.
The
pupil
jerked
again
,
seemed
to
grow
bigger
,
becoming
a
black
empty
void
,
an
unfathomable
waste
of
madness
,
a
madness
that
seemed
to
reach
out
and
engulf
him
.
He
began
to
sweat
,
a
weird
cold
extrusion
of
moisture
that
began
to
trickle
down
his
face
.
And
he
knew
without
doubt
that
the
door
must
not
be
opened
;
that
it
was
a
door
of
a
Pandora
's
Box
.
"
What
can
you
see
?
"
Forster
impatient
,
broke
the
spell
.
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
Delaney
croaked
.
"
It
's
the
eye
of
something
.
"
He
broke
free
then
said
hoarsely
,
"
Look
for
yourself
.
"
Forster
took
his
place
.
"
There
's
nothing
there
.
"
He
turned
back
to
find
Delaney
slumped
against
the
wall
.
His
face
was
green
-
and
wet
.
"
Here
.
You
all
right
?
"
Delaney
shook
his
head
.
"
Feel
a
bit
groggy
.
"
Immediately
,
Forster
shouldered
his
Uzi
,
and
took
Delaney
's
arm
over
his
shoulder
.
"
Come
on
.
Let's
get
you
topside
.
We
're
doing
no
good
here
.
"
As
Forster
helped
Delaney
to
the
ladder
he
was
unaware
of
the
huge
distorted
eye
watching
him
.
The
journey
back
to
the
surface
was
a
nightmare
.
Delaney
became
weaker
and
vomited
.
They
finally
reached
the
deck
.
Forster
struggled
with
the
door
in
the
wind
.
As
soon
as
Delaney
stumbled
through
he
was
sent
reeling
by
a
wave
,
clutching
at
a
pillar
for
support
,
and
nearly
going
over
the
side
.
The
storm
was
raging
unabated
.
Forster
slithered
to
Delaney
and
got
a
grip
,
pulling
him
back
to
comparative
safety
.
Nell
finished
taking
his
pulse
.
"
It
's
a
hundred
and
fifteen
now
.
"
She
took
the
thermometer
from
his
mouth
,
and
when
she
continued
to
stare
at
it
he
was
Unable
to
keep
the
note
of
anxiety
out
of
his
voice
.
"
Well
?
"
She
shook
the
thermometer
vigorously
,
then
wiped
the
end
with
antiseptic
.
"
Gene
-
your
turn
.
"
Forster
began
to
protest
,
but
she
pushed
the
thermometer
unceremoniously
into
his
mouth
.
Delaney
persisted
.
"
You
did
n't
answer
me
,
Nell
.
"
She
commenced
wrapping
a
blood
pressure
cuff
around
his
arm
.
"
It
was
below
normal
-
unusually
below
.
"
Delaney
frowned
.
"
But
I
was
sweating
.
"
Nell
pumped
up
the
air
,
constricting
the
blood
supply
,
then
bled
it
out
again
,
listening
with
her
stethoscope
for
the
returning
pulse
.
She
did
it
twice
,
then
pulled
the
instrument
from
her
ears
and
began
to
unwrap
the
rubber
.
"
That
might
explain
it
.
Low
and
thready
pulse
,
low
blood
pressure
-
a
condition
analogous
to
a
faint
,
peripheral
blood
supply
dilated
.
Hence
a
cold
sweat
.
"
She
paused
and
frowned
.
"
But
I
do
n't
understand
the
abnormally
low
temperature
.
"
She
plucked
the
thermometer
from
Forster
and
held
it
unbelievingly
in
front
of
her
.
Forster
's
face
twitched
.
"
Bad
news
?
"
he
asked
anxiously
.
Nell
snapped
back
into
action
,
shaking
the
thermometer
.
"
Down
a
bit
.
You
were
obviously
less
affected
.
"
Forster
looked
worried
.
"
Affected
?
By
what
?
"
She
cleaned
and
replaced
the
thermometer
into
its
flap
in
the
field
dressing
case
.
"
I
do
n't
know
.
"
"
I
only
felt
a
bit
off
,
"
Forster
admitted
.
"
Put
it
down
to
the
movement
of
the
ship
.
We
can
all
get
seasick
even
after
years
of
boats
.
"
"
I
know
.
I
know
.
"
She
frowned
then
directed
her
question
at
Delaney
.
"
You
say
you
only
began
to
feel
funny
while
you
were
looking
at
the
eye
?
"
"
Yes
.
"
Delaney
was
emphatic
.
That
alone
made
him
feel
foolish
.
Was
he
becoming
mentally
ill
?
If
so
,
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
for
the
moment
.
After
this
was
over
he
would
get
a
full
medical
check
.
In
fact
he
would
have
to
.
Nell
would
be
duty-bound
to
report
.
And
then
he
remembered
something
.
Nell
,
too
,
had
said
she
was
feeling
depressed
and
peculiar
.
Was
Titron
weaving
its
spell
?
But
how
?
Was
this
the
way
it
had
begun
for
the
crew
?
Delaney
knew
that
he
had
to
talk
more
with
Nell
,
and
warn
the
others
.
But
suddenly
he
felt
utterly
exhausted
.
"
Got
to
rest
.
Theo
,
will
you
take
over
?
"
"
Sure
.
"
Nell
helped
him
to
lie
down
on
a
blanket
,
supporting
his
head
with
another
.
Worried
,
she
fussed
around
him
,
so
much
so
that
he
gripped
her
hand
.
"
I
'm
OK
,
really
.
Just
need
to
sleep
it
off
.
"
With
that
he
blacked
out
.
When
he
came
to
,
he
was
disorientated
,
staring
blankly
at
a
man
sitting
with
his
back
to
him
.
Then
the
confusion
lifted
,
and
he
remembered
.
It
was
Grant
,
at
a
control
console
.
Nell
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
,
keeping
a
look
out
.
Delaney
felt
his
head
.
It
was
aching
badly
,
but
the
heaviness
had
gone
completely
.
He
groaned
.
Nell
turned
,
and
came
over
to
him
quickly
.
She
sank
down
beside
him
,
hand
moving
to
his
forehead
.
"
How
do
you
feel
?
"
Delaney
sagged
against
the
wall
.
"
Better
.
"
Relieved
,
her
hand
ruffled
his
hair
,
the
anxiety
lifting
from
her
face
.
"
What
some
people
will
do
to
get
attention
.
"
Her
easy
warmth
made
Delaney
feel
good
,
as
he
licked
his
dry
lips
.
"
I
could
do
with
a
cup
of
tea
.
"
Delighted
,
she
straightened
.
"
One
steaming
mug
coming
up
.
"
"
Are
you
using
water
from
Titron
?
"
he
asked
.
Nell
shook
her
head
.
"
No
.
We
collected
rain
water
.
Ate
only
our
compo
rations
.
"
Delaney
looked
around
him
.
"
Where
's
Lawton
and
Forster
?
"
Nell
moved
to
a
collection
of
cans
and
packets
on
the
floor
near
him
,
kneeling
as
she
ignited
a
solid
fuel
heater
.
"
They
've
gone
on
a
recce
.
"
"
Why
?
"
he
asked
,
suddenly
alert
.
Nell
continued
watching
the
flaring
heat
.
"
We
've
had
a
breakthrough
.
"
She
placed
a
tea
bag
into
a
mug
as
Grant
answered
.
"
With
the
power
on
I
began
investigating
some
of
these
control
panels
.
The
ones
I
did
n't
recognise
.
Came
up
with
this
.
"
He
stood
up
and
moved
aside
,
revealing
a
bank
of
small
closed
circuit
television
monitoring
screens
.
Delaney
staggered
over
,
half
falling
into
the
vacated
chair
.
Most
of
the
distorted
blue-green
views
showed
a
series
of
rectangular
corridors
,
many
with
louvred
side
doors
that
Delaney
did
not
recognise
.
They
were
not
like
the
crew
quarters
,
but
reminded
him
more
of
a
hospital
,
even
before
he
saw
what
appeared
to
be
an
operating
theatre
.
Another
showed
a
row
of
cell-like
steel
doors
.
Delaney
peered
closer
at
the
last
one
,
the
view
spoilt
by
the
fast
upward
flickering
of
the
frame
.
Grant
obligingly
twiddled
a
knob
,
but
to
no
avail
.
"
I
'm
afraid
the
hold
has
gone
on
that
one
.
"
Nell
came
over
,
and
waved
at
the
whole
lot
.
"
We
reckon
it
's
the
missing
laboratory
.
"
"
But
where
the
hell
is
it
situated
?
"
Grant
pointed
at
one
of
the
screens
.
"
You
can
just
make
out
the
division
markings
on
the
walls
where
they
've
joined
the
units
.
"
It
sank
in
.
Delaney
looked
closer
for
confirmation
.
"
It
's
the
inside
of
the
containers
in
the
hold
.
They
've
been
used
like
sectional
housing
.
A
sort
of
prefabricated
complex
.
"
Grant
nodded
his
agreement
.
But
somebody
's
gone
to
considerable
lengths
to
disguise
the
fact
.
"
The
water
began
to
boil
.
"
Something
significant
about
all
this
equipment
?
"
Nell
asked
as
she
turned
away
.
She
did
n't
wait
for
a
reply
,
but
spelled
out
the
answer
herself
.
"
To
have
a
surveillance
system
on
a
ship
where
everybody
is
involved
can
only
mean
one
thing
.
"
"
Which
is
?
"
Delaney
prompted
.
"
It
's
a
system
not
to
guard
against
intruders
,
but
a
system
to
ensure
that
somebody
does
n't
get
out
.
And
somebody
,
if
you
ask
me
,
who
is
bloody
dangerous
.
"
The
uncharacteristic
profanity
brought
him
around
in
the
chair
.
"
How
long
have
they
been
gone
?
"
Nell
finished
pouring
the
boiling
water
into
a
mug
as
Grant
checked
his
watch
.
"
About
half
an
hour
.
They
went
to
find
the
entrance
to
the
complex
.
Reckoned
it
was
in
the
superstructure
below
somewhere
.
"
Delaney
gratefully
accepted
the
mug
of
tea
from
Nell
.
"
Why
did
n't
they
wait
for
me
?
"
Grant
glanced
at
Nell
.
"
We
had
no
idea
how
long
you
'd
be
out
,
"
Nell
explained
,
her
face
suddenly
tensing
.
"
Look
!
"
Down
one
of
the
corridors
appeared
a
black-clad
figure
,
face
covered
by
his
respirator
.
But
they
all
knew
it
was
Lawton
.
Another
figure
slipped
down
the
other
side
.
Delaney
set
the
mug
of
tea
down
.
"
What
the
hell
's
got
into
them
?
See
if
you
can
raise
them
on
the
radio
.
"
Grant
spoke
swiftly
into
his
transceiver
,
twice
calling
for
Lawton
or
Forster
to
respond
.
The
only
reaction
was
from
the
latter
,
his
masked
face
suddenly
turning
in
the
direction
of
one
of
the
cameras
.
He
gave
a
thumbs
up
sign
.
Grant
shook
his
head
.
"
Probably
ca
n't
make
us
out
.
Distortion
from
all
this
steel
.
"
Delaney
got
to
his
feet
and
reached
for
his
Uzi
.
"
They
'll
need
more
back
up
.
"
Limping
,
Grant
made
to
follow
.
Nell
brushed
past
him
.
"
I
'll
go
.
"
For
a
second
Delaney
hesitated
.
Nell
's
chin
came
up
.
"
You
're
suspect
medically
.
And
Martin
's
leg
is
no
better
.
Besides
he
's
better
with
the
electronic
wizardry
.
"
That
clinched
it
.
"
Come
on
.
"
Delaney
and
Nell
ran
down
the
stairs
,
ignoring
precautions
.
The
entrance
was
on
the
second
deck
,
a
large
double
door
now
wide
open
that
Delaney
remembered
from
before
,
thinking
at
the
time
that
it
led
to
a
storage
area
.
They
pulled
up
,
suddenly
cautious
,
and
looked
in
.
It
was
a
white
,
featureless
corridor
with
a
blank
"
T
"
junction
facing
them
.
Nell
glanced
towards
Delaney
,
feeling
the
unease
rise
in
her
like
a
fanned
fire
;
the
feeling
that
the
white
,
ordinary-looking
corridor
with
its
strip
lighting
and
featureless
walls
led
down
to
-
what
?
She
was
fearful
.
It
was
a
fear
that
she
sensed
not
with
her
intellect
,
more
with
her
body
,
as
though
the
very
cells
themselves
had
a
collective
memory
.
She
shivered
at
some
ill-defined
idea
,
drifting
past
out
of
reach
,
in
the
foggy
recesses
of
her
mind
.
But
she
had
no
more
time
for
abstract
thoughts
.
Delaney
snapped
on
his
gas
mask
.
Nell
reached
for
her
own
,
and
began
to
pull
it
over
her
head
.
The
claustrophobia
took
her
unawares
.
Not
since
the
first
time
in
the
gloomy
training
tunnel
deep
underground
had
the
panic
risen
in
her
as
the
rubber
closed
around
her
nose
and
mouth
,
momentarily
sealing
off
her
breathing
,
like
a
parasitic
thing
covering
her
face
.
She
got
control
of
herself
,
found
Delaney
pausing
,
and
looking
around
for
her
.
The
brighter
light
reflected
on
his
glass
eyepieces
,
gleamed
on
the
moulded
side
muzzle
of
the
respirator
.
She
shuddered
.
The
freakishness
of
their
own
appearance
seemed
entirely
appropriate
.
And
ominous
.
Grant
saw
them
immediately
,
traversing
the
same
passage
they
'd
seen
Forster
and
Lawton
follow
.
He
snatched
his
gaze
back
to
the
latter
.
Lawton
had
just
appeared
in
what
looked
like
an
operating
theatre
,
standing
motionless
in
the
corner
as
though
an
actual
operation
was
in
progress
and
he
was
an
unwelcome
intruder
.
Forster
slipped
in
beside
him
,
looking
around
,
and
moving
to
an
anaesthetic
machine
.
Grant
could
make
out
some
pretty
sophisticated-looking
electronic
hardware
massed
down
one
wall
in
addition
to
a
cardiac
visual
display
monitor
and
the
usual
paraphernalia
of
an
intensive
care
unit
.
Lawton
finally
moved
,
crossing
to
double
doors
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
.
He
looked
through
the
small
windows
,
then
motioned
for
Forster
to
join
him
.
Grant
instinctively
moved
closer
to
the
screen
,
sensing
the
excitement
in
Lawton
.
He
glanced
quickly
across
to
check
on
Delaney
and
Nell
,
and
was
turning
his
attention
back
to
the
others
,
when
he
frowned
.
On
the
flickering
screen
,
one
of
the
cell-like
doors
was
ajar
,
yet
he
was
sure
they
had
all
been
shut
.
He
watched
the
screen
,
struggled
to
get
the
frame-hold
to
work
,
all
the
while
keeping
an
eye
on
the
scene
in
the
operating
theatre
.
Lawton
and
Forster
finally
passed
from
view
through
the
doors
.
Grant
glanced
across
,
and
saw
that
Delaney
had
reached
another
"
T
"
junction
.
The
black-clad
figure
hesitated
then
turned
the
corner
.
But
whereas
the
others
had
gone
to
the
left
,
Delaney
went
to
the
right
.
Half-heartedly
,
Grant
used
his
transceiver
,
and
called
them
.
It
was
no
use
.
As
Nell
followed
,
the
rows
of
screens
for
the
first
time
were
blank
,
showing
no
signs
of
life
.
Grant
turned
his
attention
to
the
flickering
one
-
and
gaped
.
The
cell-like
door
was
now
open
.
Wide
open
.
Delaney
realised
they
were
lost
when
finally
,
after
innumerable
turnings
in
the
maze
of
corridors
,
they
came
to
a
dead
end
.
Nell
nudged
him
,
and
pointed
to
the
door
behind
her
.
It
was
a
lift
.
Delaney
nodded
,
and
thumbed
the
button
.
Immediately
the
doors
drew
open
.
Inside
Nell
took
a
position
by
the
panel
as
Delaney
shot
a
last
glance
around
the
corridor
;
then
followed
her
in
.
Forster
stood
before
the
row
of
suits
,
hanging
like
a
lie
of
petrified
robots
,
and
immediately
recognised
them
for
what
they
were
;
instantly
realised
the
enormous
risk
they
might
all
be
running
,
at
least
below
decks
.
Grant
saw
the
lift
door
open
and
Delaney
and
Nell
step
cautiously
out
,
directly
under
the
camera
.
He
could
see
the
surprise
,
the
awe
,
as
they
stopped
,
looking
at
something
he
could
not
see
.
But
the
camera
was
designed
to
guard
the
lift
entrance
,
and
not
show
what
lay
beyond
.
On
the
flickering
screen
just
to
the
right
,
light
suddenly
reflected
from
something
in
the
black
hole
of
the
cell-like
room
.
Even
though
it
caught
his
eyes
,
so
that
he
was
actually
watching
when
it
happened
,
the
figure
that
leapt
from
the
blackness
was
only
a
silvery
blur
,
moving
with
breathtaking
and
unreal
speed
.
Grant
,
stunned
,
sat
staring
at
the
cell
entrance
,
not
sure
if
he
had
imagined
what
he
'd
seen
,
or
not
.
"
It
's
a
submersible
.
For
really
deep
work
.
"
Delaney
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
hull
of
the
craft
that
looked
as
if
it
owed
more
to
space
technology
than
to
marine
engineering
.
Silently
,
Nell
regarded
the
white
,
steel
tube
with
a
sphere
at
one
end
and
set
with
two
"
V
"
observation
ports
surrounded
by
remote
control
grab
arms
,
and
saw
only
an
insect-like
thing
,
a
huge
preying
mantis
.
Delaney
heaved
himself
aboard
,
the
vessel
moving
gently
on
the
only-black
water
of
the
dock
.
"
I
wondered
why
my
ears
popped
in
the
lift
.
"
He
surveyed
the
section
of
Titron
's
hull
that
housed
the
submersible
.
The
roof
above
was
the
false
bottom
of
the
hold
.
"
This
part
's
pressurised
.
Keep
the
water
out
.
"
He
pulled
off
his
mask
and
looked
down
into
the
open
conning
tower
.
The
mass
of
instruments
was
like
the
cockpit
of
a
seven-four-seven
,
even
down
to
a
control
column
.
He
stepped
back
on
to
the
deck
.
From
the
water
lying
everywhere
the
storm
had
obviously
battered
the
unattended
diving
area
.
"
So
that
's
what
all
the
research
is
about
.
Some
sort
of
hush-hush
oceanography
,
probably
for
oil
.
Something
like
that
.
"
Nell
,
relieved
to
be
rid
of
it
,
followed
his
lead
and
pulled
off
her
own
mask
.
For
the
first
time
she
could
smell
the
dankness
and
the
odour
of
rotting
seaweed
.
The
place
was
like
a
cave
.
Her
brooding
sense
of
unease
would
n't
be
placated
by
his
explanation
.
Living
things
inhabited
caves
,
did
n't
they
?
A
large
wave
passed
.
As
Titron
lifted
,
the
black
water
in
the
dock
sucked
away
,
opening
up
a
drop
of
several
feet
,
only
to
be
followed
by
a
surge
upwards
.
The
submersible
rose
higher
in
the
dock
,
the
overflowing
sea
rushing
like
a
tide
over
their
boots
.
Pumps
cut
in
,
clearing
the
water
through
drains
.
Delaney
splashed
across
to
one
wall
where
a
mass
of
underwater
tackle
was
stored
.
There
were
racks
of
wet
suits
,
dry
suits
,
helmets
,
air
tanks
,
helium
,
oxygen
and
others
he
did
not
recognise
.
Pinned
to
the
wall
was
a
huge
contoured
map
,
with
alongside
it
,
in
graph
layout
,
a
profile
of
the
depth
of
the
ocean
floor
.
His
finger
found
a
precisely
outlined
section
delineated
in
red
marker
.
He
whistled
.
"
That
's
some
depth
they
've
been
working
at
,
"
he
said
.
"
Wonder
how
the
hell
they
got
anything
up
from
there
.
"
Nell
stood
beside
him
.
"
Perhaps
they
"
re
not
bringing
it
up
.
But
putting
it
down
.
"
Delaney
turned
to
look
directly
at
her
.
"
Why
would
they
need
to
dump
out
in
this
God-forsaken
place
?
Nuclear
waste
is
disposed
of
at
much
shallower
depths
.
And
it
's
no
secret
.
"
Nell
shrugged
.
"
Just
a
suggestion
,
that
's
all
.
"
She
moved
on
,
leaving
him
looking
thoughtful
,
to
stand
in
front
of
a
hugely
monstrous
brilliant
orange
diving
suit
,
the
helmet
a
streamlined
dome
with
built-in
lamp
,
camera
,
and
gas
pressure
and
communication
lines
.
He
came
and
stood
at
her
side
,
pointing
at
two
circular
hatches
in
the
floor
flanked
by
handrails
,
with
massive
spheres
secured
nearby
.
"
They
have
everything
.
These
deep
suits
are
probably
used
in
conjunction
with
those
diving
bells
.
"
But
Nell
,
transfixed
by
the
giant
suits
before
her
,
was
hardly
listening
.
"
John
,
"
she
said
,
"
could
that
figure
they
saw
have
been
somebody
in
one
of
these
?
"
"
No
way
,
"
he
grunted
.
"
If
it
was
,
the
man
could
hardly
have
moved
,
and
would
have
been
almost
totally
at
the
mercy
of
Silk
.
"
Nell
nodded
.
But
the
thought
persisted
,
and
would
n't
go
away
.
And
after
all
,
what
other
explanation
could
there
be
?
Grant
saw
Forster
and
Lawton
reappear
,
moving
back
the
way
they
had
come
.
For
a
shocked
moment
he
thought
Forster
was
carrying
a
man
over
his
shoulder
,
then
he
saw
what
it
was
,
and
understood
why
Lawton
was
weighed
down
with
cylinders
.
Nervously
his
eyes
flicked
over
the
screen
.
There
was
no
sign
of
the
silvery
man-like
thing
.
Forster
and
Lawton
passed
from
view
,
soon
to
reappear
in
another
corridor
.
Grant
scanned
the
still
empty
passages
behind
them
.
They
were
getting
well
clear
now
,
even
allowing
for
its
unnatural
speed
.
His
concentration
was
broken
by
a
sound
.
A
light
,
tinkling
sound
.
Grant
glanced
round
to
see
the
clipboards
on
the
wall
jingling
as
if
in
a
breeze
.
He
checked
the
two
sliding
doors
into
the
wheelhouse
.
They
were
still
tightly
closed
.
He
turned
back
in
time
to
see
Nell
and
Delaney
step
out
of
the
lift
.
Anxiously
he
watched
them
,
acutely
aware
that
they
were
no
longer
alone
in
the
maze
of
corridors
of
the
system
.
At
least
there
was
no
sign
of
the
creature
.
Grant
pushed
out
his
lower
lip
.
Creature
?
What
did
he
expect
?
Something
out
of
the
comic
books
?
The
clipboards
tinkled
again
,
but
he
did
n't
bother
to
turn
round
this
time
.
"
This
must
be
the
main
thoroughfare
.
"
Nell
surveyed
the
double
width
corridor
they
had
stumbled
upon
.
They
began
opening
every
door
as
they
walked
up
its
length
.
Laboratory
after
laboratory
presented
itself
,
each
stacked
with
equipment
of
all
types
.
Nell
guessed
from
the
centrifuges
and
freezers
what
type
of
work
they
had
been
designed
for
.
She
said
nothing
to
Delaney
at
that
moment
about
her
growing
suspicion
.
The
end
of
the
wide
corridor
was
guarded
by
double
doors
with
a
warning
symbol
on
either
side
of
them
.
Nell
recognised
it
,
but
a
sign
also
spelled
out
the
message
:
DANGER
.
BIO-HAZARD
.
Delaney
hesitated
,
but
Nell
,
used
to
it
in
hospital
laboratories
,
pushed
on
through
.
Immediately
facing
them
was
a
large
electronic
diagram
covering
the
wall
.
At
the
bottom
,
a
yellow
light
marked
the
entrance
.
Nell
tapped
it
with
her
finger
.
"
It
's
a
diagram
of
the
unit
.
We
're
here
-
"
She
pointed
.
"
-
in
Barrier
Zone
one
.
As
you
go
deeper
in
towards
the
centre
laboratory
you
pass
through
progressively
cleaner
bio-medical
zones
,
starting
here
with
a
shower
.
After
that
you
wear
paper
overalls
that
get
combusted
at
every
stage
.
"
Delaney
nodded
,
his
eyes
taking
in
the
rest
of
the
diagram
.
Level
Two
:
Infra
Red
and
Long
Wave
radiation
decontamination
.
Gastro
Intestinal
tract
sterilisation
.
Level
Three
:
Body
Scan
.
Booster
Injections
.
Scan
for
fungal
lesions
.
Level
Four
:
Zinnon
lamp
.
"
What
's
that
?
"
Delaney
asked
,
tapping
his
finger
.
When
Nell
did
n't
reply
,
he
turned
to
see
if
she
had
heard
him
;
found
her
staring
fixedly
at
the
sign
.
"
You
put
on
a
head
and
face
cover
,
"
she
explained
almost
mechanically
,
"
go
into
a
chamber
naked
,
and
come
out
covered
in
white
powder
.
It
's
your
own
hair
and
a
micro-layer
of
epithelial
skin
burnt
away
to
an
ash
.
Does
n't
hurt
.
"
Delaney
was
staggered
.
"
Is
this
common
then
in
bio-research
?
"
"
No
.
In
fact
,
I
only
know
of
one
in
the
whole
of
the
UK
.
"
She
hesitated
.
"
And
that
's
at
Porton
Down
.
"
He
did
n't
require
further
explanation
,
for
he
knew
that
Porton
Down
was
the
MOD
's
research
station
into
micro-biological
and
chemical
warfare
.
Delaney
swallowed
,
suddenly
realising
the
implication
,
the
reason
why
Nell
's
face
was
white
behind
her
re-donned
mask
.
When
at
last
he
spoke
,
his
voice
was
tight
,
fully
realising
that
the
respirators
they
were
wearing
were
inadequate
for
most
nerve
gases
.
"
Are
we
at
risk
?
"
Nell
shrugged
,
felt
her
legs
weakening
.
"
It
's
possible
,
"
she
admitted
.
"
It
could
be
the
answer
to
your
missing
crew
.
"
Delaney
faced
her
squarely
.
"
How
do
you
mean
exactly
?
"
"
There
may
have
been
some
leak
,
causing
hallucinations
,
wholesale
insanity
.
"
Delaney
felt
dizzy
,
trying
to
fight
down
the
rising
imagination
that
would
produce
symptoms
out
of
nothing
.
"
Why
have
n't
we
been
affected
up
to
now
?
"
Even
as
he
said
it
he
remembered
.
Nell
saw
it
in
his
eyes
,
and
nodded
.
"
Maybe
that
's
what
happened
to
you
in
the
engine
room
.
And
-
"
She
faltered
,
looking
down
at
her
hands
.
"
-
I
've
been
upset
and
uneasy
ever
since
we
came
aboard
.
There
may
be
residual
pockets
of
it
left
.
Although
,
I
do
n't
know
-
it
's
just
a
guess
.
"
Delaney
turned
back
to
the
electronic
display
.
"
In
that
case
would
n't
it
have
been
equally
lethal
to
us
?
"
Nell
shook
her
head
slowly
.
"
Not
necessarily
.
The
storm
and
passing
of
time
would
have
caused
its
dissipation
and
dilution
.
And
there
is
another
possible
factor
.
"
"
Go
on
.
"
"
If
it
was
biological
as
opposed
to
chemical
it
might
have
been
unstable
,
mutated
by
now
into
something
non-lethal
.
There
's
no
way
of
knowing
.
But
it
might
mutate
again
.
"
Her
eye
caught
something
on
the
video
display
,
the
shock
transferring
to
Delaney
.
"
What
is
it
?
"
She
seemed
to
be
staring
,
transfixedly
,
at
the
lowest
part
of
the
laboratory
complex
,
at
a
bright
light
that
had
flickered
on
.
Even
as
he
found
it
,
it
went
dull
then
cut
out
again
,
as
though
there
was
a
bad
connection
.
He
guessed
immediately
.
"
Self-destruct
.
The
laboratory
.
This
ship
should
have
blown
up
?
"
Nell
nodded
.
"
The
one
at
Porton
Down
has
just
the
same
safety
device
.
For
use
in
extreme
emergency
.
If
the
impossible
happened
and
there
was
any
danger
of
outside
contamination
,
a
miniature
,
ultra-clean
thermo
nuclear
device
would
sear
it
,
and
everything
in
the
laboratory
,
into
sterile
dust
.
"
Delaney
looked
at
Nell
in
disbelief
.
"
A
nuclear
bomb
-
in
England
?
"
Nell
seemed
to
collect
herself
.
"
Ask
yourself
,
John
,
a
device
the
size
of
a
nuclear
tactical
shell
used
by
the
artillery
,
with
damage
confined
only
to
the
research
station
,
or
the
dissemination
of
some
of
the
most
deadly
bacterial
and
viral
agents
the
world
has
ever
known
.
"
She
paused
to
nod
,
more
to
confirm
it
to
herself
than
Delaney
.
"
You
can
take
it
from
me
,
Titron
was
supposed
to
have
been
melted
off
the
face
of
the
earth
.
Only
something
went
wrong
.
Otherwise
we
would
n't
be
standing
on
this
deck
right
now
.
"
Thoughts
raced
in
his
head
,
jostling
for
priority
.
Whitehall
would
have
known
,
but
he
'd
been
told
nothing
.
Why
?
Delaney
remembered
the
feeling
he
had
had
that
Connors
was
holding
something
back
.
That
something
began
to
take
shape
in
his
thoughts
.
G9
had
not
only
secured
Titron
-
it
had
also
been
a
probe
.
When
they
were
relieved
they
would
be
debriefed
.
Relieved
?
Another
crew
?
He
suddenly
went
cold
,
with
a
dreadful
certainty
.
There
never
would
be
a
relief
crew
.
Ever
!
He
looked
at
Nell
,
and
saw
that
she
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
.
He
tried
to
smile
.
"
Seems
like
we
might
be
made
redundant
.
"
He
guessed
that
when
they
made
their
report
,
probably
by
radio
to
a
close
in-surface
unit
,
the
MOD
would
finish
the
job
and
order
the
destruction
of
the
Titron
.
And
there
would
be
no
survivors
.
They
could
never
risk
it
.
Nell
felt
despair
enfold
her
.
She
was
desolate
.
Death
-
she
had
so
longed
for
it
that
she
hardly
gave
it
a
second
thought
.
But
she
did
n't
want
it
to
happen
to
him
.
She
was
so
poorly
versed
in
the
emotions
that
she
failed
to
comprehend
its
true
nature
.
Love
.
Anger
.
She
found
her
voice
.
"
Let's
launch
the
lifeboat
and
get
away
.
We
'll
make
it
.
What
they
've
done
to
us
is
immoral
.
"
Her
head
came
up
,
eyes
flashing
.
"
The
world
should
know
about
Titron
.
"
Delaney
took
her
by
the
arm
,
and
held
her
tightly
as
she
struggled
.
"
It
's
no
good
.
They
'd
come
after
us
.
There
'll
be
no
escape
,
anywhere
.
Not
now
.
We
all
know
too
much
.
"
Grant
had
watched
them
standing
in
front
of
the
electronic
display
,
puzzling
at
the
excessive
time
they
seemed
to
be
wasting
.
He
checked
for
Lawton
and
Forster
,
saw
them
pass
the
entrance
again
.
They
would
be
with
him
in
no
time
.
Strangely
he
was
glad
about
that
.
It
was
difficult
to
explain
,
but
he
'd
been
uneasy
for
the
last
few
minutes
:
not
an
emotion
he
'd
ever
had
much
experience
of
before
.
And
it
was
n't
for
the
others
'
safety
.
It
was
as
though
an
aura
of
something
evil
was
present
,
reaching
out
to
him
.
He
became
suddenly
aware
of
a
strange
,
unpleasant
smell
.
Grant
sat
back
,
decided
to
use
his
transceiver
and
call
up
Lawton
,
hungry
for
the
sound
of
another
human
voice
.
He
reached
down
,
found
his
field
bag
-
and
saw
the
feet
behind
him
.
At
first
he
thought
they
were
some
sort
of
exotic
underwater
flippers
,
scaly
,
silvery
,
tailing
away
to
black
ends
with
claw-like
projections
.
It
was
only
when
they
tensed
,
curling
and
tightening
their
grip
on
the
floor
,
did
he
realise
they
were
alive
.
The
memory
of
the
fleetingly
seen
silver
man-shape
flashed
into
his
mind
.
Fearfully
,
he
looked
slowly
up
.
His
eyes
made
an
incredible
journey
.
What
they
saw
at
the
end
fundamentally
shocked
his
system
.
Lawton
led
the
way
up
to
the
bridge
,
Forster
with
the
body
,
as
Grant
had
first
thought
,
over
his
shoulder
.
Lawton
suspected
nothing
,
merely
practised
caution
because
it
was
trained
into
him
and
was
not
an
instinct
.
He
reached
the
level
of
the
bridge
,
swung
his
back
to
the
wall
,
covering
the
ladder
they
had
just
used
as
Forster
made
for
the
door
.
In
an
instant
Forster
saw
a
flash
of
silvery
light
;
sensed
the
wrongness
.
He
threw
off
his
load
,
unslung
his
Uzi
and
ripped
open
the
door
.
Going
through
the
chart
room
curtains
,
half
enveloped
by
them
,
was
a
shape
-
the
back
of
a
man
?
-
something
,
just
disappearing
from
view
,
and
moving
with
incredible
speed
.
Forster
fired
a
quick
burst
from
the
hip
,
bullets
ripping
and
splintering
fabric
and
wood
,
ricocheting
dangerously
from
the
steel
wall
.
He
leapt
forward
,
intent
on
hot
pursuit
,
and
caught
sight
of
Grant
-
or
rather
,
what
was
left
of
him
.
Everything
went
from
his
mind
,
only
the
sense
to
rip
off
his
mask
before
the
vomit
came
.
Finally
,
Lawton
stood
beside
him
.
"
What
in
God
's
name
could
do
that
?
"
Somewhere
far
below
a
door
slammed
.
They
'd
talked
little
on
the
way
back
,
Delaney
desperately
trying
to
find
another
reason
,
however
unlikely
,
for
Connors
not
briefing
him
fully
.
He
wanted
a
way
out
-
for
Nell
's
sake
.
But
his
tortured
mind
could
only
come
to
the
same
conclusion
.
G9
were
expendable
.
By
definition
.
So
when
the
proverbial
shit
had
hit
the
fan
in
Whitehall
,
Connors
,
or
somebody
like
him
,
would
have
drawled
at
the
emergency
conference
.
"
I
've
just
the
answer
.
That
little
known
unit
we
've
always
had
-
bunch
of
misfits
,
really
.
They
'll
be
glad
of
the
action
.
They
can
give
us
a
full
report
-
"
Six
months
later
,
Delaney
had
lit
tie
doubt
that
the
tragic
explosion
of
an
oil
tanker
in
mid
ocean
would
have
long
since
been
forgotten
,
and
Connors
,
or
whoever
,
would
be
in
the
New
Year
's
Honours
List
.
Could
he
really
complain
?
After
all
,
it
was
true
.
They
were
a
specialist
group
trained
for
long-shot
missions
,
usually
with
appalling
odds
.
But
duplicity
?
To
be
sent
callously
,
unwittingly
to
their
deaths
like
laboratory
animals
.
Anger
on
a
slow
fuse
began
to
build
.
At
least
,
he
thought
,
Nell
would
survive
.
He
'd
see
to
that
somehow
.
They
'd
just
set
foot
back
in
the
ship
proper
when
the
burst
of
machine
gun
fire
rooted
them
to
the
spot
.
When
the
moment
passed
,
Delaney
took
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
.
The
bridge
door
was
wide
open
.
As
he
breasted
the
deck
level
Delaney
ducked
back
,
threw
himself
aside
at
the
sight
of
the
figure
sprawled
on
the
ground
.
A
micro-second
later
his
brain
finally
perceived
the
detail
.
The
figure
did
n't
move
;
was
twisted
unnaturally
.
Cautiously
he
mounted
the
remaining
stairs
,
recognised
the
figure
for
what
it
was
and
stepped
over
it
to
the
wheelhouse
.
Lawton
met
him
and
reported
grimly
.
"
Grant
's
dead
.
Attacked
by
the
same
thing
that
got
Silk
.
Or
so
we
think
.
"
He
stood
back
and
made
way
for
him
.
Delaney
stepped
into
the
wheelhouse
,
his
eyes
taking
in
the
smashed
console
,
then
dropping
down
to
the
grisly
,
earthly
remains
of
Grant
.
He
knew
then
that
the
mystery
of
Titron
was
only
partly
explained
by
the
secret
biological
warfare
establishment
.
There
was
another
reason
why
the
ship
would
not
-
could
not
-
be
allowed
to
live
.
Something
utterly
alien
and
beyond
comprehension
had
been
born
in
Titron
's
belly
.
And
that
something
was
obscene
,
deadly
,
and
now
-
free
.
Grant
's
remains
were
shovelled
into
a
canvas
bag
.
Tense
,
facing
outwards
,
Forster
,
Lawton
and
Nell
guarded
Delaney
as
he
intoned
the
seaman
's
prayer
of
interment
,
and
then
committed
the
canvas
bag
to
the
ocean
.
The
storm
was
abating
rapidly
,
the
evening
sky
clearing
in
the
west
with
the
golden
rays
of
the
setting
sun
adding
a
dying
colour
to
the
sullen
slate
blue
water
.
The
whiteness
of
the
canvas
body-bag
dimmed
beneath
the
onrushing
sea
,
faded
at
the
edges
,
then
grew
smaller
,
greener
,
and
was
gone
.
They
returned
to
the
bridge
,
fearful
of
every
dark
place
-
every
corner
,
every
door
.
The
gangway
lamps
seemed
to
give
no
light
,
only
add
further
to
the
gloom
of
the
dusk
.
Back
in
the
wheelhouse
,
Delaney
faced
them
.
"
Right
.
You
all
know
the
score
.
As
I
see
it
we
've
got
two
choices
.
One
,
we
get
out
of
here
now
.
Launch
the
lifeboat
,
take
our
chances
,
or
-
two
,
we
go
after
whatever
it
is
.
"
Nobody
spoke
immediately
.
Finally
Forster
glanced
at
Lawton
for
support
,
and
drawled
laconically
.
"
I
'm
not
leaving
here
until
we
've
done
for
that
bastard
.
It
's
personal
from
now
on
in
!
"
Lawton
nodded
his
agreement
.
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
feel
the
same
.
"
"
Nell
?
"
Delaney
asked
,
looking
at
her
squarely
.
"
I
agree
,
"
she
said
without
hesitation
.
Their
tense
,
edgy
faces
watched
Delaney
closely
.
"
We
do
n't
know
what
we
're
up
against
,
"
Delaney
said
,
"
so
let's
proceed
with
maximum
caution
.
"
"
Trouble
is
,
"
Lawton
said
,
with
a
frown
,
"
there
are
n't
enough
of
us
to
search
the
ship
.
It
can
work
its
way
past
us
,
and
hide
again
.
We
could
still
be
looking
for
it
when
they
blow
us
out
of
the
water
.
"
"
That
's
why
we
've
got
to
take
risks
,
"
Nell
put
in
.
"
Lure
it
into
a
trap
,
somehow
.
And
quickly
.
Forster
's
chuckle
was
mirthless
.
"
I
do
n't
think
this
joker
is
going
to
need
much
encouragement
.
"
"
No
.
"
Delaney
was
momentarily
thoughtful
.
"
What
had
you
in
mind
,
Nell
?
"
She
pointed
to
the
figure
of
a
man
propped
in
the
corner
,
and
the
cylinders
of
oxygen
in
the
back
pack
lying
beside
it
.
"
Two
of
our
number
have
been
killed
.
Each
time
when
they
were
on
their
own
.
Let's
give
it
the
same
conditions
,
only
this
time
we
use
that
as
the
bait
.
"
They
looked
at
the
"
man
"
Forster
had
found
.
It
was
a
safety
suit
,
an
advanced
model
of
the
NBC
type
with
its
own
oxygen
tanks
.
"
One
in
ambush
,
with
the
rest
of
us
acting
like
beaters
.
Start
at
one
end
of
the
ship
,
making
as
much
noise
as
possible
.
"
Forster
grunted
.
"
It
had
no
trouble
finding
Grant
.
I
think
it
's
a
good
idea
.
And
I
'll
go
in
the
suit
until
we
reach
the
ambush
point
.
Might
help
to
draw
it
.
"
They
helped
him
kit
up
,
Nell
connecting
the
leads
from
the
back
pack
into
the
suit
attachments
.
Forster
's
breathing
whistled
out
of
the
one-way
valve
.
Behind
the
clear
,
wide
vizor
,
he
tried
to
smile
.
"
Cosy
in
here
,
"
he
joked
.
"
Even
got
my
own
toilet
.
Bloody
handy
in
the
circumstances
.
"
Delaney
took
the
lead
.
It
was
now
light
,
the
lamps
on
the
gangway
giving
murky
yellow
pools
that
barely
pushed
back
the
inky
blackness
of
a
starless
night
.
At
the
entrance
to
the
laboratory
complex
the
others
drew
on
their
own
masks
.
Ineffectual
or
not
against
lingering
gases
it
seemed
a
wise
precaution
,
even
if
it
was
only
psychological
.
Delaney
glanced
back
at
them
.
"
Let's
make
sure
it
knows
where
we
are
.
"
They
made
noise
;
slammed
doors
.
Nell
shuddered
.
Were
unseen
eyes
watching
them
?
Was
it
even
now
shadowing
them
,
moving
soundlessly
from
cover
to
cover
,
like
a
tiger
in
the
steel
jungle
?
Forster
's
radio-projected
voice
broke
into
her
thoughts
.
"
Looks
a
good
place
.
"
He
was
at
the
entrance
to
the
secure
lab
zone
.
"
This
must
be
the
only
way
in
,
"
Nell
said
.
Forster
was
quickly
de-suited
.
As
they
set
up
the
now
empty
suit
with
its
back
to
the
door
,
half
slumped
over
a
control
panel
,
he
settled
down
behind
the
curtained
entrance
of
the
showers
.
Delaney
's
voice
was
hushed
.
"
Maybe
we
should
leave
two
of
us
here
?
"
"
Do
n't
want
to
rouse
any
suspicions
.
Forster
was
adamant
.
"
After
all
,
it
might
be
able
to
count
.
"
When
he
did
n't
get
any
response
,
he
patted
the
Uzi
beside
him
on
the
steel
floor
.
"
I
wo
n't
be
unprepared
like
poor
old
Grant
.
"
Delaney
pulled
the
curtain
across
,
covering
Forster
who
cut
a
small
slit
in
the
opaque
green
plastic
,
widening
it
to
give
himself
a
better
field
of
view
.
Lawton
came
and
crouched
down
in
front
of
it
.
"
I
've
left
the
suit
's
radio
on
full
,
"
he
said
.
"
Make
it
sound
interesting
if
we
talk
occasionally
.
"
He
hesitated
.
"
Good
luck
.
"
"
I
feel
like
a
Maharajah
waiting
for
the
tiger
to
pounce
on
the
tied-up
goat
,
"
Forster
grinned
.
"
I
hope
I
do
n't
have
to
wait
all
night
.
"
Nell
shuddered
.
Night
.
This
was
a
night
in
their
minds
-
a
creature
from
the
darker
side
of
man
's
intellect
.
Something
worried
her
about
that
thought
.
Something
hidden
behind
the
more
obvious
sentiment
.
After
they
'd
gone
,
Forster
felt
the
silence
physically
settle
around
him
.
He
'd
never
been
one
to
exercise
an
over-imagination
,
yet
the
conditions
were
like
the
feeling
of
a
tomb
-
of
an
interment
.
Would
he
be
found
,
he
mused
,
a
thousand
years
from
then
,
a
dust-covered
skeleton
?
He
chuckled
.
And
the
Uzi
a
primitive
weapon
,
the
bio
suit
mistaken
for
some
sort
of
ceremonial
armour
?
The
first
stunning
silence
gave
way
to
the
creaking
of
the
ship
and
a
far-off
booming
of
the
sea
against
the
hull
.
The
radio
on
the
dummy
suddenly
screeched
into
action
as
Delaney
's
distorted
voice
gave
it
life
.
The
thousands
of
tons
of
steel
made
real
communication
impossible
.
His
own
radio
was
off
.
Forster
settled
down
,
only
putting
his
eye
to
the
slit
every
half
minute
,
not
continually
as
he
had
started
to
do
.
He
had
a
good
view
of
the
long
shadowy
main
corridor
.
The
only
problem
was
if
-
he
corrected
himself
-
when
it
came
,
which
side
turning
,
if
any
,
would
it
use
.
The
further
away
the
better
.
The
more
time
to
see
it
approach
.
The
trouble
was
the
transverse
corridor
just
outside
the
room
.
If
the
approach
was
that
way
he
would
get
no
warning
at
all
,
and
it
would
be
on
top
of
George
-
his
name
for
the
dummy
sitting
like
a
drunken
son-of-a-bitch
-
before
he
knew
it
.
If
that
happened
,
he
'd
have
to
work
fast
.
What
he
'd
seen
done
to
Grant
made
Forster
realise
that
whatever
it
was
struck
with
demonic
speed
and
savagery
.
In
seconds
,
poor
old
George
would
be
spread
around
the
room
like
an
explosion
in
Harrod
's
window
,
and
the
thing
would
be
away
.
Or
on
him
.
as
if
in
protest
,
George
uttered
a
blood-curdling
,
lunatic-sounding
cackle
,
and
fell
fractionally
forward
.
Forster
suppressed
a
nervous
giggle
.
They
reached
the
main
deck
,
dropping
down
in
a
defensive
posture
,
eyes
searching
the
stacked
containers
,
trying
to
probe
the
black
,
jagged
recesses
between
them
.
Lawton
scanned
upwards
.
"
It
could
be
anywhere
.
Even
back
on
the
bridge
again
.
"
"
We
should
start
in
the
engine
room
,
"
Nell
suggested
,
shivering
,
"
work
up
through
the
crew
's
quarters
,
and
then
into
the
complex
.
"
Confronted
with
the
need
to
proceed
,
Delaney
took
risks
,
plummeting
feet
first
through
the
hatchways
,
and
partly
breaking
his
descent
with
the
handrails
,
falling
like
a
parachutist
,
rolling
instantly
deploying
his
Uzi
against
-
Against
what
?
Like
Forster
,
all
he
could
guess
was
that
it
was
fast
.
Grant
may
have
been
lame
,
but
-
fast
or
silent
?
Or
both
?
The
speed
of
descent
must
have
cut
down
the
exposure
to
any
residual
gas
since
he
felt
none
of
the
earlier
weirdness
as
he
approached
the
still
sealed
engine
room
door
.
Pandora
's
Box
?
He
winced
at
the
memory
as
he
hammered
on
the
steel
and
then
looked
through
the
spy
port
.
In
the
stroboscopic
view
,
the
giant
pistons
were
the
only
things
moving
-
until
a
figure
detached
itself
from
the
wall
,
its
grey
colour
exactly
that
of
the
background
steel
.
Like
a
chameleon
,
it
moved
out
of
the
aisle
between
machines
,
then
stopped
,
and
became
utterly
motionless
.
Delaney
's
stillness
caught
the
attention
of
the
others
.
Nell
's
transceivered
voice
crackled
in
his
headphones
.
"
What
is
it
?
"
He
did
n't
want
to
take
his
eyes
from
it
-
equally
he
wanted
somebody
else
to
see
it
.
To
confirm
.
Gently
as
though
he
might
disturb
it
,
he
pulled
back
.
"
Take
a
look
for
yourself
.
"
She
did
-
and
caught
her
breath
.
The
creature
was
large-headed
,
absurdly
so
,
its
body
half
man
,
half
something
lost
in
the
primordial
past
.
But
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
fundamentally
it
was
-
human
.
Nell
knew
,
and
not
only
because
she
was
a
female
of
the
same
species
.
She
could
see
in
its
eyes
-
intelligence
.
And
human
fear
.
But
also
,
as
a
doctor
,
she
knew
exactly
what
it
was
.
She
told
Delaney
,
who
shook
his
head
with
revulsion
.
Nell
would
never
rest
until
she
could
get
closer
to
confirm
her
worst
suspicions
,
and
paradoxically
it
was
the
woman
in
her
that
provided
the
intensity
of
emotion
that
would
let
nothing
stand
in
her
way
.
George
,
the
sacrificial
dummy
,
had
n't
emitted
a
squeak
for
a
long
time
.
Forster
scanned
the
corridor
once
more
.
It
was
empty
.
just
as
it
always
had
been
.
He
sat
back
again
,
eyeing
the
blank
wall
before
him
,
confident
that
he
'd
catch
it
,
however
good
it
was
.
He
kept
wondering
how
it
had
got
Silk
.
Silk
was
the
meanest
,
toughest
professional
he
'd
ever
known
.
And
yet
he
'd
disappeared
,
without
trace
.
Forster
was
a
fatalist
.
He
shrugged
.
You
could
be
James
Bond
,
he
thought
,
but
if
something
had
your
number
on
it
-
A
gentle
breeze
broke
the
absolute
silence
,
moving
the
curtain
so
that
he
had
to
steady
it
with
his
hand
.
Instantly
alert
,
Forster
checked
through
his
spy
port
.
Nothing
.
But
a
door
had
opened
somewhere
.
Somebody
,
or
something
,
had
entered
the
complex
.
It
could
be
the
others
returning
-
or
the
start
of
his
ambush
.
"
For
God
's
sake
leave
your
mask
on
.
And
that
's
an
order
!
"
But
Delaney
's
plea
was
in
vain
.
Nell
pulled
it
off
,
got
close
to
the
door
,
and
shouted
.
"
We
mean
you
no
harm
.
You
can
help
us
.
"
When
she
checked
through
the
spyhole
it
was
standing
in
exactly
the
same
spot
,
unmoving
,
like
a
lizard
.
Lawton
shook
his
head
.
"
Ca
n't
hear
you
.
Try
the
ship
's
system
again
.
"
Nell
ran
to
the
wall
telephone
,
and
pushed
the
digit
for
engine
room
.
The
small
light
beneath
the
receiver
rests
showed
that
the
line
was
working
.
Worried
,
Delaney
followed
,
searching
her
face
,
fearing
the
tell-tale
signs
of
toxicity
.
On
impulse
,
and
against
his
better
judgment
,
he
pulled
off
his
own
mask
.
Nell
repeatedly
pressed
the
button
,
shouted
across
at
Lawton
,
who
was
now
using
the
spy
port
.
"
What
's
happening
?
"
The
back
of
Lawton
's
head
shook
,
his
radio-projected
voice
crackling
.
"
Nothing
now
.
The
head
jerked
,
just
the
once
,
to
the
left
,
so
I
reckon
it
heard
the
"
phone
.
"
He
straightened
up
and
came
over
,
directing
his
question
at
Delaney
.
"
We
ought
to
get
on
.
"
Delaney
nodded
his
agreement
.
"
Leave
it
,
Nell
.
"
His
tone
was
sharp
.
"
It
's
not
going
anywhere
.
"
She
squared
up
to
him
,
defiantly
,
"
I
ca
n't
,
John
.
Do
n't
you
see
?
The
poor
thing
is
part
of
this
madness
.
If
we
can
get
to
it
,
I
can
learn
so
much
more
.
And
in
any
case
,
it
might
die
if
we
do
n't
try
and
help
it
-
soon
.
"
Delaney
averted
his
gaze
from
her
,
afraid
of
what
he
had
seen
in
her
eyes
.
"
Perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
it
did
.
"
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
,
"
she
said
,
stepping
away
from
him
.
Delaney
fiddled
awkwardly
with
his
mask
,
preparatory
to
putting
it
back
on
again
.
"
For
God
's
sake
,
Nell
.
All
I
mean
is
,
we
've
got
a
job
to
do
.
And
Forster
's
neck
's
on
the
line
.
Do
n't
you
owe
it
to
him
to
come
now
?
"
She
flushed
,
but
held
on
to
the
"
phone
.
Obviously
striving
to
be
as
controlled
as
possible
,
she
smiled
.
"
You
two
can
manage
,
"
she
said
calmly
.
"
I
can
do
better
here
,
on
my
own
.
Quietly
.
If
I
succeed
it
will
unlock
a
lot
of
the
mystery
of
what
's
been
done
on
Titron
.
And
-
"
She
faltered
.
"
-
I
think
we
owe
it
to
that
pathetic
creature
in
there
.
"
"
Pathetic
?
"
Delaney
tried
to
play
down
the
fear
in
his
voice
-
fear
for
her
.
"
It
might
be
bloody
dangerous
.
Certainly
,
something
on
this
ship
is
.
"
"
Not
this
one
,
"
Nell
said
,
shaking
her
head
with
some
kind
of
reassurance
.
"
I
just
know
.
"
Lawton
gestured
in
the
gangway
.
"
You
may
not
be
at
risk
from
what
is
in
here
.
What
about
out
there
?
There
's
no
guarantee
that
what
we
're
hunting
is
going
to
follow
the
rules
.
"
Nell
shrugged
.
"
That
's
a
risk
I
'll
have
to
take
.
I
've
got
a
more
important
job
here
.
"
Delaney
knew
there
was
no
way
she
would
be
shifted
from
her
chosen
course
.
Ordering
her
would
be
ludicrous
under
the
changed
circumstances
,
and
in
any
event
,
a
waste
of
time
.
But
Lawton
was
right
.
The
risk
from
the
other
danger
,
or
dangers
of
Titron
,
frightened
him
more
.
"
Help
me
secure
the
stairs
behind
us
,
"
he
snapped
at
Lawton
,
"
as
much
as
we
can
.
"
Delaney
turned
to
Nell
.
"
It
might
buy
you
the
time
you
need
.
But
take
care
.
Do
n't
be
bloody
foolish
like
I
am
,
leaving
you
here
.
Establish
contact
if
you
can
.
No
more
at
this
stage
.
Understand
?
And
do
n't
try
and
get
the
door
open
.
"
But
Nell
was
hardly
listening
.
To
please
him
she
nodded
,
then
despite
Lawton
's
presence
,
squeezed
Delaney
's
arm
.
"
And
you
.
"
She
smiled
.
"
Watch
out
.
"
Reluctantly
,
Delaney
made
for
the
gangway
.
Lawton
had
already
shifted
some
chairs
,
in
readiness
to
form
a
barricade
.
He
gave
him
a
hand
with
a
large
oil
drum
,
and
then
another
,
as
Nell
,
tearing
herself
from
her
appointed
task
,
dragged
over
a
bench
.
As
they
drew
back
up
the
stairs
,
piling
on
the
pieces
she
threw
up
at
them
,
Lawton
sniffed
.
"
This
wo
n't
hold
anything
.
Just
slow
it
down
.
"
Like
Forster
before
her
,
Nell
indicated
her
pistol
and
grenades
.
"
As
long
as
there
's
ti
me
,
that
's
all
we
need
.
"
As
they
descended
the
stairs
,
Delaney
paused
,
and
took
a
last
look
down
at
her
.
She
smiled
shyly
,
then
turned
away
.
In
a
sense
,
as
long
as
he
could
convince
himself
that
she
was
safe
,
he
was
glad
she
was
n't
coming
with
them
.
Whatever
it
was
they
were
after
,
it
was
an
unknown
quantity
,
unknown
,
that
is
,
except
for
a
lethal
ferocity
.
He
pulled
on
his
respirator
,
his
mind
made
up
to
get
back
to
her
as
soon
as
he
could
,
for
Nell
Anderson
was
all
he
cared
about
now
.
There
it
went
again
.
Forster
frowned
as
he
looked
through
his
spy
hole
.
A
sound
.
He
could
n't
place
it
,
but
it
reminded
him
strongly
of
something
.
The
corridor
was
empty
.
It
had
happened
three
times
now
.
A
hissing
,
We
gas
escaping
,
ending
with
a
funny
little
squeak
.
He
looked
at
George
,
wondering
if
the
sound
had
come
from
him
.
Satisfied
that
everything
was
as
it
should
be
,
he
checked
his
watch
.
Well
over
half
an
hour
had
passed
.
They
ought
to
be
near
him
soon
.
Forster
searched
in
a
pouch
and
came
up
with
a
glucose
sweet
.
Quietly
he
unwrapped
the
covering
paper
,
then
paused
,
as
some
instinct
made
him
check
again
.
As
he
did
so
,
the
sound
came
nearer
;
louder
.
His
intense
scrutiny
took
in
the
shadowy
and
empty
lengths
of
the
corridor
.
Apart
from
some
dark
patches
on
the
wall
that
he
had
n't
noticed
before
,
there
was
nothing
to
see
.
His
gaze
came
back
to
George
,
still
sprawled
over
the
control
desk
.
A
fly
landed
on
the
empty
,
staring
vizor
,
and
crawled
across
it
.
Forster
was
sorely
tempted
to
nip
out
and
confirm
that
the
noise
was
coming
from
George
by
twiddling
the
volume
and
tuner
,
but
fought
down
the
urge
.
He
sat
back
,
pulled
off
his
mask
,
and
popped
the
sweet
into
his
mouth
.
It
took
him
only
seconds
to
notice
the
smell
.
Forster
choked
as
the
putrefying
reek
seemed
to
get
right
into
him
.
Frightened
that
it
was
a
gas
pocket
,
he
fumbled
with
his
mask
,
and
finally
got
it
back
on
.
His
heart
was
thumping
.
Nothing
seemed
to
be
happening
,
all
his
senses
were
apparently
functioning
normally
,
except
-
that
the
sweet
in
his
mouth
seemed
permeated
with
the
awful
smell
;
had
become
a
slimy
lump
of
filth
.
He
had
to
get
rid
of
it
.
Forster
reached
for
his
mask
,
just
as
the
hissing
gas
noise
sounded
right
on
top
of
him
,
ending
with
a
little
shriek
.
He
knew
then
where
he
'd
heard
something
similar
before
.
It
was
like
a
man
breathing
through
a
respiratory
system
,
with
some
sort
of
one-way
valve
.
A
shadow
fell
across
the
wall
opposite
,
as
slowly
,
and
fearfully
he
turned
.
The
curtain
was
a
dense
,
opaque
greenish-yellow
,
and
something
was
right
behind
it
,
a
shape
pressing
against
the
humped
plastic
standing
there
looking
down
at
him
,
half
seen
,
half
imagined
.
His
hand
went
out
,
reached
for
the
submachine
gun
,
his
fingers
tightening
on
the
stock
.
With
a
blood-curdling
growl
,
the
curtain
was
snatched
aside
.
Forster
half
rolled
,
his
Uzi
trembling
in
his
hand
as
he
got
off
half
a
clip
at
point
blank
range
.
But
it
struck
with
the
speed
of
an
attacking
snake
.
And
something
else
;
something
he
saw
as
the
curtain
tore
away
and
he
looked
into
the
depths
of
the
unbelievable
face
above
him
,
fractionally
dulled
his
reflexes
.
After
they
'd
gone
,
Nell
tried
a
different
tactic
.
She
disarmed
herself
,
putting
her
grenades
and
pistol
down
on
to
the
floor
,
and
standing
directly
in
front
of
the
spy
hole
,
but
some
ten
feet
away
.
Arms
down
at
her
sides
,
palms
forward
,
she
waited
.
It
was
just
possible
for
her
to
see
a
suggestion
of
light
at
the
spy
hole
,
set
like
a
marble
in
the
wall
.
She
continued
to
stare
at
it
as
the
minutes
passed
.
There
was
no
other
way
she
could
think
of
,
except
to
show
the
obscene
and
pathetic
distortion
of
humanity
that
she
came
in
peace
.
It
was
only
in
the
continuing
silence
that
it
came
to
her
that
her
defenceless
back
was
presented
to
the
rest
of
the
room
.
Suddenly
,
she
began
to
hear
all
sorts
of
sounds
,
footsteps
and
slitherings
.
Angrily
,
she
fought
down
the
urge
to
turn
,
and
kept
her
eye
on
the
bead
of
light
,
willing
the
pathetic
creature
beyond
to
come
to
it
.
Directly
before
her
was
a
large
wall
clock
.
The
second
hand
swept
monotonously
around
and
around
.
She
allowed
her
gaze
to
flick
up
every
time
the
hand
passed
the
twelve
.
She
found
it
eased
her
aching
eyes
.
It
had
passed
for
the
thirteenth
time
when
she
returned
her
attention
to
the
bead
of
light
,
and
caught
her
breath
.
The
little
star
twinkled
-
and
went
out
.
They
were
actually
in
the
prefabricated
complex
when
the
staccato
chatter
of
the
Uzi
echoed
through
the
steel
maze
like
the
sound
of
a
rivet
gun
.
Just
the
one
quick
burst
.
The
trap
had
been
sprung
!
Delaney
and
Lawton
threw
all
caution
,
all
training
,
to
the
wind
.
And
ran
.
At
first
,
Delaney
could
n't
see
anything
different
.
The
dummy
was
still
propped
over
the
desk
,
the
shower
curtain
drawn
.
Then
he
realised
the
shower
was
on
.
"
Gene
?
"
he
called
.
The
only
reply
was
the
steady
hissing
of
the
water
.
They
took
up
opposite
sides
of
the
room
,
approaching
the
concealing
curtain
with
extreme
caution
,
the
stubby
barrels
of
the
Uzi
submachine
gun
ready
to
blast
anything
that
leapt
forward
.
The
shower
hissed
on
.
Delaney
grasped
at
the
curtain
,
Lawton
crouching
for
a
better
angle
.
At
a
nod
from
Lawton
,
Delaney
snatched
the
curtain
back
.
Blood
from
Forster
's
broken
body
was
floating
away
in
clouds
,
finally
swirling
in
a
whirlpool
above
the
drain
.
His
injuries
were
horrendous
.
But
what
held
Delaney
and
Lawton
in
rigid
shock
was
the
lump
of
black
,
flesh-like
jelly
crawling
over
his
face
,
covering
it
like
some
huge
,
abnormal
slug
.
Delaney
recovered
first
,
unthinking
,
uncaring
of
danger
,
screaming
out
,
and
grabbing
the
slippery
,
obscene
filth
,
ripping
it
off
and
in
one
movement
throwing
it
hard
against
the
wall
.
With
a
splat
,
great
splits
opened
up
in
the
mass
.
It
slid
down
the
wall
,
leaving
behind
it
a
trail
of
dark
brown
juice
,
like
bile
.
Lawton
sucked
in
air
.
"
Christ
Almighty
!
"
Where
it
had
covered
Forster
's
face
,
his
neck
,
chin
,
mouth
,
nose
and
one
cheek
,
the
skin
and
lips
had
gone
,
as
if
etched
away
by
acid
.
Delaney
dropped
down
beside
him
,
ignoring
the
still
running
shower
,
to
plunge
his
hand
over
Forster
's
heart
.
"
He
's
still
alive
.
"
Forster
's
eyes
flickered
open
as
Lawton
began
to
pack
a
dressing
into
the
gaping
abdominal
wound
.
His
hand
,
still
surprisingly
strong
,
gripped
Lawton
's
wrist
.
"
Leave
it
-
too
late
.
"
He
coughed
,
a
great
wracking
of
torn
tissue
.
More
blood
appeared
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
.
His
eyes
found
those
of
Delaney
.
"
John
-
watch
out
.
This
one
-
not
-
natural
-
"
Coughing
intervened
.
When
it
stopped
,
Delaney
had
to
lean
closer
as
Forster
's
voice
dropped
to
a
grating
whisper
.
"
I
got
off
-
a
full
clip
.
Right
into
its
chest
.
Never
batted
an
eyelid
.
"
His
face
screwed
up
into
what
Delaney
thought
was
pain
,
but
suddenly
realised
it
was
an
attempt
at
a
grin
.
"
Sheer
luck
-
it
's
tagged
itself
with
one
of
these
.
"
His
hand
reached
up
,
flicked
feebly
at
one
of
Delaney
's
pouches
.
In
there
they
all
carried
a
small
radio
homing
device
,
to
find
each
other
blindly
if
necessary
.
The
hand
dropped
back
and
the
eyes
closed
.
Delaney
looked
up
at
Lawton
.
"
Did
you
get
that
?
"
Lawton
nodded
.
There
was
one
other
thing
that
Delaney
had
to
know
.
"
Turn
off
that
bloody
shower
,
"
he
snapped
at
Lawton
.
He
put
his
mouth
next
to
Forster
's
ear
.
"
Gene
,
what
does
it
look
like
?
"
The
eyes
remained
closed
.
Why
was
it
important
?
Delaney
did
n't
really
know
.
He
hated
himself
for
pressing
a
dying
friend
,
but
some
gut-fear
,
some
primordial
terror
drove
him
on
.
"
Gene
?
Can
you
hear
me
?
What
does
it
look
like
?
"
The
lipless
mouth
barely
moved
.
"
Silk
.
"
Forster
died
,
leaving
Delaney
and
Lawton
in
a
terrified
bewildered
silence
.
It
was
still
watching
her
.
Nell
stayed
as
she
was
for
a
long
time
,
then
had
an
inspiration
.
Slowly
she
raised
her
hands
,
unpicked
her
hair
,
and
let
it
fall
free
.
Did
it
,
she
wondered
,
know
the
difference
between
a
man
and
a
woman
?
There
had
been
signs
that
some
of
the
cabins
had
been
occupied
by
women
.
But
had
any
worked
in
the
laboratory
?
Been
close
to
the
thing
beyond
the
door
at
its
inception
?
She
resolved
to
try
everything
.
She
turned
,
came
slowly
around
until
she
was
facing
the
door
again
,
so
that
it
could
see
she
had
no
weapons
of
any
sort
-
knife
,
gun
,
grenade
.
The
observation
port
remained
dark
.
It
was
still
watching
.
What
should
she
do
next
?
There
seemed
to
be
only
one
thing
she
could
do
.
She
walked
slowly
towards
the
door
,
tapped
gently
,
then
stood
back
and
waited
.
After
a
couple
of
minutes
she
tried
again
.
But
the
observation
port
remained
relentlessly
black
.
Disappointment
began
to
turn
to
irritation
.
It
was
then
that
she
heard
a
whistling
noise
,
and
smelt
a
sickening
odour
.
Before
she
had
time
to
assimilate
anything
,
from
the
top
of
the
gangway
came
a
terrible
growl
-
deep
,
huge
,
more
frightening
in
its
ferocity
than
any
wild
animal
she
'd
ever
heard
.
The
nearest
she
could
recall
was
the
booming
of
the
big
'gators
in
the
Florida
swamps
where
she
had
once
been
trained
.
But
it
was
more
than
a
growl
.
It
was
-
Footsteps
came
on
the
gangway
.
God
!
It
was
coming
down
for
her
.
Horror-struck
,
she
was
rooted
to
the
spot
with
terror
,
her
eyes
drawn
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
waiting
for
the
first
sign
.
Of
what
?
When
it
came
,
her
reaction
was
like
that
of
Grant
-
that
it
was
a
boot
;
part
of
a
sub-aquatic
suit
.
And
then
she
took
in
the
claw-like
ends
,
curling
inwards
to
grasp
the
stair
.
It
took
another
step
down
.
Huge
scaly
legs
,
moist
,
glistening
,
with
some
slimy
covering
that
she
instinctively
knew
was
giving
off
the
putrid
smell
.
An
arm
reached
down
.
The
hand
was
n't
like
the
feet
-
was
n't
human
;
was
n't
anything
natural
.
It
appeared
to
be
a
glove
that
was
hinged
at
the
joints
.
It
grabbed
a
chair
,
crunched
the
metal
-
like
paper
,
and
flung
it
aside
with
a
snarl
.
In
her
transfixed
state
,
physically
unable
to
move
,
Nell
's
thoughts
were
extraordinarily
clear
.
It
suddenly
came
to
her
-
the
hidden
meaning
in
her
thought
when
they
'd
left
Forster
taking
up
his
position
in
ambush
.
The
creature
from
the
darker
side
of
man
's
intellect
.
It
was
the
word
intellect
.
And
it
was
a
man
-
of
sorts
.
Therefore
it
had
an
intellect
.
And
a
cunning
of
its
own
.
At
that
precise
moment
,
Delaney
came
to
the
same
conclusion
as
Nell
.
They
had
n't
been
hunting
it
.
The
reverse
was
true
.
All
along
,
it
had
been
hunting
them
.
Again
,
another
chair
was
crumpled
and
flung
aside
.
An
oil
drum
was
kicked
away
,
rolling
and
crashing
into
the
wall
beside
her
.
Another
step
down
.
And
another
step
nearer
.
More
of
the
thickening
,
massive
legs
.
And
suddenly
she
was
no
longer
sure
that
it
was
scales
.
It
began
to
appear
more
convoluted
,
interlocking
chain
mail
-
some
sort
of
suit
.
But
the
slime
was
real
,
oozing
between
the
layers
.
One
more
step
and
she
would
be
confronted
by
its
face
-
a
face
that
would
encompass
her
own
death
.
The
moment
was
too
full
of
terror
,
of
crashes
and
grunts
,
for
her
to
hear
the
door
unlocking
behind
her
,
and
to
hear
it
swing
inwards
.
But
she
heard
the
thin
,
childlike
voice
with
its
very
sing-song
quality
,
cutting
across
the
stupefying
silence
after
another
huge
growl
.
"
In
here
!
"
As
the
creature
bent
lower
,
bringing
its
face
nearer
to
the
point
of
being
seen
,
she
turned
,
conscious
of
a
fleeting
impression
in
the
darkness
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
of
a
pair
of
blazing
eyes
.
It
must
have
seen
what
was
happening
,
for
with
a
great
scream
,
it
scattered
the
rest
of
the
barricade
,
like
matchwood
.
She
heard
it
crash
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
and
felt
the
floor
quiver
as
it
gained
on
her
.
Nell
tripped
on
the
edge
of
the
door
frame
,
fell
head-first
into
the
engine
room
,
and
was
conscious
of
something
scything
through
the
air
,
snatching
at
the
rubber
back
of
her
wet
suit
.
The
world
seemed
to
be
full
of
an
enraged
bellowing
,
then
the
door
slammed
,
cutting
off
the
noise
.
Silence
,
as
seconds
passed
.
Lying
on
the
floor
,
face
down
,
she
felt
around
at
her
back
.
The
rubber
had
been
cut
wide
open
,
as
though
slashed
by
a
surgeon
's
knife
.
She
felt
hot
moisture
.
Her
blood
.
The
shocked
priority
of
examining
herself
after
escaping
,
literally
,
from
the
jaws
of
death
,
wore
off
.
She
remembered
where
she
was
.
Remembered
her
unlikely
saviour
.
Under
the
duress
of
the
moment
,
the
act
of
crossing
the
threshold
into
this
place
had
passed
unnoticed
.
She
raised
her
head
and
looked
around
.
The
feet
were
by
the
door
,
small
,
ill-formed
,
like
wax
models
of
a
child
's
that
had
passed
through
flame
and
were
partially
melted
.
They
would
possess
none
of
the
inherent
tactile
and
balancing
powers
of
hers
,
or
that
creature
outside
.
Nell
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
rest
of
the
body
;
and
caught
her
breath
.
Her
guess
as
to
what
it
fundamentally
was
had
been
correct
.
As
a
doctor
she
'd
seen
others
like
it
before
.
So
many
times
.
But
never
in
the
normal
world
-
one
nearly
five
feet
tall
.
It
was
a
human
embryo
of
some
forty
days
that
had
been
somehow
arrested
,
then
grown
to
its
own
obscene
maturity
.
John
Delaney
knew
now
that
all
along
it
had
been
hunting
them
,
that
it
was
still
hunting
them
,
waiting
for
the
right
moment
to
pick
them
off
at
will
,
one
at
a
time
.
One
at
a
time
!
"
Oh
God
!
Nell
.
"
He
sprang
upright
,
ran
,
not
caring
if
Lawton
was
with
him
or
not
.
Lawton
was
struggling
to
get
out
of
his
pack
the
receiver
that
would
pick
up
the
radio
signals
from
the
miniature
transceiver
Forster
said
was
attached
to
his
slayer
.
Switched
on
it
remained
silent
,
until
they
reached
the
deck
.
There
the
bleeping
came
through
loud
and
clear
.
"
John
.
"
Delaney
had
already
got
one
leg
over
the
door
frame
that
led
below
,
and
would
have
stopped
for
no
one
,
except
that
his
glance
took
in
the
obvious
truth
.
The
main
signal
strength
was
coming
in
the
direction
of
the
deck
cargo
.
"
Nell
's
all
right
,
"
Lawton
said
,
adding
:
"
It
's
over
here
and
moving
away
.
Delaney
paused
,
then
came
to
stand
beside
Lawton
,
watching
as
the
latter
swung
the
radio
direction
finder
in
a
small
arc
.
The
stronger
signal
came
from
the
port
side
.
"
No
heroics
,
"
Delaney
ordered
.
"
We
stick
together
.
"
"
What
are
we
going
to
do
when
we
make
contact
?
"
Lawton
asked
.
Delaney
took
out
the
remainder
of
his
plastic
explosives
.
"
Give
me
yours
.
We
'll
try
and
get
it
with
this
.
Failing
that
,
it
'll
be
phosphorus
grenades
.
"
Lawton
handed
over
his
plastic
,
then
found
the
two
phosphorus
grenades
they
each
carried
.
They
were
among
the
most
abhorrent
of
all
weapons
.
Exploding
phosphorus
landing
on
a
body
continued
to
burn
in
the
tissue
,
inflicting
indescribable
damage
.
Lawton
had
seen
the
effect
on
friend
and
foe
alike
.
Phosphorus
and
napalm
.
They
'd
kept
him
awake
for
many
an
hour
prior
to
an
op
.
Delaney
fixed
the
detonating
pins
into
the
plastic
,
using
the
remaining
length
of
wire
to
bind
it
to
the
timer
,
making
a
DIY
bomb
.
Sweating
profusely
,
he
set
the
fuse
to
just
less
than
two
seconds
.
They
both
knew
that
no
timer
could
be
relied
upon
to
be
that
sensitive
,
that
when
he
activated
it
,
the
chances
were
reasonable
that
it
would
detonate
instantly
-
before
he
could
throw
it
.
They
moved
into
the
first
,
pitch
black
canyon
,
faintly
lit
by
a
Poacher
's
Moon
,
their
passage
marked
by
the
persistent
bleeping
of
the
detector
.
In
the
sheltered
darkness
,
out
of
the
wind
,
it
seemed
to
grow
louder
and
more
piercing
.
At
every
corner
they
paused
,
checked
the
signal
strength
,
held
it
at
arm
's
length
to
see
if
they
could
detect
a
greater
strength
around
the
other
side
.
Grimly
,
Delaney
looked
up
at
the
sky
.
Half
an
hour
had
passed
.
as
if
to
set
the
final
scene
,
the
moon
now
rode
majestically
clear
of
the
clouds
,
forming
a
hard
,
bright
discus
in
the
star-pitted
blackness
of
the
night
.
A
blue
column
of
light
reflected
off
the
calm
sea
.
"
It
's
on
the
move
again
,
"
Lawton
whispered
.
"
Gone
to
the
left
.
"
They
followed
,
deep
now
among
the
containers
,
every
muscle
paining
from
their
constant
alertness
.
Twice
before
it
had
stopped
,
allowing
them
to
get
close
,
only
to
move
away
again
as
their
senses
had
reached
a
fever
pitch
of
readiness
.
Nagging
unease
began
to
seep
into
Delaney
's
weary
bones
.
What
was
it
up
to
?
"
It
's
stopped
again
,
"
Lawton
breathed
.
"
It
strikes
me
it
's
searching
for
something
.
"
"
Searching
?
"
Delaney
thought
about
it
,
and
decided
it
did
n't
make
sense
,
unless
it
was
looking
for
something
that
it
badly
needed
.
He
half
sensed
,
never
really
thought
it
though
,
that
whatever
it
was
it
was
looking
for
,
was
essential
to
its
very
existence
.
as
if
to
confirm
his
train
of
thought
there
came
a
great
crashing
and
a
screeching
of
metal
.
"
Sounds
as
if
it
's
trying
to
break
into
one
of
the
containers
.
"
Lawton
's
voice
was
tense
,
the
signal
bleeper
at
its
loudest
.
"
It
's
just
around
the
next
corner
.
And
it
's
stationary
.
"
Delaney
,
excited
,
gripped
Lawton
's
arm
.
"
That
's
it
.
What
do
you
reckon
they
hold
up
there
on
deck
?
"
Lawton
shrugged
.
"
Supplies
for
the
rest
of
the
ship
?
"
"
In
particular
?
"
Delaney
prompted
.
"
Of
course
.
All
the
stuff
that
lab
needs
would
be
housed
up
here
.
Easier
for
stocking
up
at
sea
.
"
"
And
that
creature
needs
something
.
If
we
time
it
right
we
'll
catch
it
with
its
pants
down
.
"
They
waited
,
listening
,
as
the
salty
night
air
with
the
sound
of
softly
hissing
waves
was
split
by
more
shearing
,
protesting
metal
,
and
deep
unearthly
growls
.
There
was
a
final
crash
,
then
silence
.
The
bleeper
kept
up
its
steady
,
plaintive
tone
.
"
It
's
torn
a
door
off
,
"
Delaney
whispered
.
"
And
gone
inside
.
"
"
Yes
,
"
Lawton
nodded
in
agreement
.
Delaney
swallowed
.
"
Ready
?
"
"
When
you
are
.
Torches
?
"
He
had
already
decided
"
yes
"
,
otherwise
it
would
be
impossible
to
throw
the
bomb
and
grenades
with
any
accuracy
.
He
knew
he
would
only
get
one
chance
with
the
plastic
.
They
pulled
the
chunky
torches
from
their
holsters
,
and
primed
them
for
high
output
.
They
would
burn
like
arc
lamps
for
a
very
short
duration
.
Delaney
took
hold
of
Lawton
's
shoulder
and
squeezed
in
time
as
he
counted
down
.
"
Three
.
Two
.
One
.
Go
!
"
They
leapt
up
screaming
,
zig-zagging
forward
in
the
classic
battle
charge
of
the
British
Army
.
Lawton
took
the
left
side
.
Delaney
the
right
.
The
brilliant
beams
of
their
torches
were
like
searchlights
,
swinging
wildly
for
a
second
,
until
they
finally
converged
at
the
back
of
a
container
with
its
door
ripped
open
and
lying
at
a
crazy
angle
.
And
inside
,
where
the
beams
of
the
torchlights
met
,
was
-
nothing
.
It
was
empty
!
Delaney
had
a
split
second
to
realise
that
all
along
it
had
been
setting
up
a
trap
for
them
.
Then
it
struck
,
and
all
hell
broke
loose
.
Nell
got
to
her
feet
and
finally
found
her
voice
.
"
Who
are
you
?
"
The
massive
head
,
still
with
the
marks
at
the
side
of
the
throat
where
the
gills
would
have
been
,
sighed
.
The
voice
was
tiny
,
forced
out
with
grunts
of
air
,
a
whistle
that
was
formed
into
words
that
were
as
incomplete
and
ill-defined
as
its
body
.
Nell
was
reminded
of
the
shrill
talk-whistles
of
dolphins
.
"
I
-
am
-
Piphros
.
"
It
sounded
mechanical
,
not
unlike
a
well-trained
parrot
.
"
Thank
you
for
saving
my
life
,
"
Nell
heard
herself
saying
.
"
What
was
that
out
there
?
"
The
weird
,
ill-formed
mouth
moved
again
,
and
ignoring
her
question
,
countered
with
its
own
.
"
I
-
do
-
not
-
know
-
you
.
"
Was
it
thinking
independently
,
or
just
mouthing
another
phrase
?
Nell
decided
to
push
her
medical
status
.
"
I
am
Doctor
Nell
Anderson
.
Some
of
us
were
airlifted
-
that
is
,
sent
-
to
see
what
had
gone
wrong
.
To
help
you
.
"
Nell
's
fears
grew
that
this
living
creature
that
was
neither
one
thing
or
truly
the
other
,
would
never
understand
her
.
It
suddenly
moved
,
walking
in
an
uncoordinated
and
jerking
movement
,
straight
towards
her
.
Nell
flinched
,
but
stood
her
ground
.
At
the
last
moment
,
it
veered
away
and
came
to
halt
by
a
vent
.
She
realised
that
the
creature
needed
heat
.
Doing
nothing
to
disturb
it
,
she
moved
deliberately
to
the
door
,
and
looked
through
the
spy
hole
.
There
was
nothing
to
see
,
only
wreckage
.
She
turned
back
,
and
only
then
remembered
that
someone
had
started
the
engines
.
If
it
had
been
Piphros
,
it
was
encouraging
.
"
Are
you
on
your
own
?
"
"
All
-
alone
.
"
The
tiny
child-like
squeak
sounded
wistful
and
sad
.
"
Why
did
they
all
go
away
?
"
Nell
probed
further
.
"
It
-
was
-
the
-
madness
.
"
Nell
shivered.
:
Having
said
it
like
that
,
even
though
she
had
suspected
it
all
along
,
brought
a
terrible
picture
to
the
mind
.
"
Do
you
know
why
the
madness
came
?
"
The
creature
avoided
her
question
.
"
I
-
was
-
often
-
here
.
They
-
called
-
me
-
Pip
.
"
Nell
digested
the
startling
fact
and
tried
to
come
to
terms
with
the
idea
of
this
creature
ever
being
a
ship
's
mascot
.
Then
she
relented
.
In
a
strange
way
,
if
you
forgot
what
it
really
was
,
perhaps
never
knew
,
here
was
a
kind
of
trusting
innocence
that
would
have
found
favour
with
the
non-scientific
crew
of
Titron
.
The
better
side
of
humanity
.
Piphros
seemed
unable
to
speak
for
long
,
needed
to
rest
its
chest
,
which
wheezed
and
bubbled
.
"
Madness
-
came
-
with
-
accident
.
"
Piphros
said
quite
suddenly
.
"
What
accident
?
Where
?
"
Perhaps
it
was
her
over-active
imagination
,
or
maybe
she
was
getting
used
to
that
strange
bland
face
and
the
enormous
overhanging
whale-like
brow
,
but
she
felt
she
saw
fear
flit
across
it
,
momentarily
.
"
Mahon
-
operation
-
wrong
.
"
Startled
,
Nell
remembered
the
operating
theatre
they
had
seen
.
She
could
only
guess
at
the
operation
.
Sickened
,
she
knew
that
they
were
more
likely
vivisections
of
human
tissue
,
experimental
procedures
with
the
toxic
chemical
and
biological
substances
carried
on
board
.
"
Who
is
Mahon
?
"
Piphros
'
head
began
to
move
from
side
to
side
,
the
entire
body
shaking
,
and
oozing
moisture
.
The
creature
was
,
Nell
realised
,
terrified
and
sweating
.
Tears
rolled
out
of
the
eyes
.
"
Was
that
Mahon
who
came
after
me
?
"
"
Yes
.
He
-
is
-
evil
.
"
Nell
swallowed
,
slowly
held
out
her
hand
,
forcing
herself
to
touch
the
obscene
body
before
her
,
instinctively
aware
that
a
gesture
of
contact
would
be
the
most
effective
way
to
calm
the
creature
.
The
skin
,
on
contact
,
was
surprisingly
cold
,
the
tissue
blubbery
,
like
a
hard
boiled
egg
.
"
You
are
safe
now
.
"
The
large
head
shook
.
"
You
-
do
-
not
-
understand
.
Mahon
-
is
-
not
-
like
-
us
.
"
Nell
flinched
as
the
whistly
words
came
faster
and
higher
,
as
Piphros
grew
more
agitated
.
"
Mahon
-
destroys
.
"
Nell
still
did
not
know
the
details
,
doubted
now
if
anyone
would
.
But
it
did
n't
matter
.
The
essence
was
there
in
all
its
hideous
implication
.
Nerve
gas
tests
with
human
tissue
.
Embryological
distortions
.
And
God
alone
knew
what
other
sorts
of
mutations
and
genetical
mutilations
.
And
then
there
was
Mahon
,
and
some
disastrous
accident
that
had
spread
a
batch
of
nerve
gas
through
the
ship
before
it
could
be
dealt
with
,
leaving
Piphros
the
only
other
creature
alive
.
All
because
of
Mahon
.
And
Mahon
was
not
like
them
-
like
Piphros
.
What
grotesque
outlandish
possibility
was
it
that
made
Piphros
so
certain
,
so
frightened
about
it
?
Uneasily
,
Nell
realised
there
was
just
one
more
mystery
to
solve
on
Titron
.
And
it
promised
to
be
the
most
weird
-
was
definitely
the
most
lethal
.
A
great
bellow
of
triumph
exploded
on
top
of
them
.
From
right
beside
Lawton
something
huge
detached
itself
from
the
shadows
.
Lawton
screamed
,
was
lifted
off
his
feet
as
Delaney
swung
around
,
bomb
ready
.
"
Get
clear
!
For
God
's
sake
,
get
clear
!
"
His
beam
of
light
swept
wide
,
took
in
a
sight
that
was
fragmented
,
never
a
whole
picture
.
Then
he
was
knocked
flat
,
crashing
into
a
steel
wall
.
The
light
smashed
off
,
the
bomb
flying
from
his
outstretched
hands
into
the
darkness
.
But
Delaney
had
seen
a
glistening
,
moist
thing
wrapped
around
Lawton
's
waist
,
like
the
coil
of
a
snake
.
And
as
the
beam
of
light
had
spun
free
,
before
it
exploded
into
darkness
again
,
an
image
had
burnt
into
his
mind
that
he
would
never
forget
.
It
was
of
a
man
;
huge
,
encrusted
with
bony
protrusions
that
made
the
head
appear
square
,
as
though
he
was
wearing
a
helmet
.
And
with
a
flash
of
insight
Delaney
realised
that
was
what
it
was
-
or
had
been
:
the
headgear
of
one
of
the
deep
sea
diving
suits
.
But
now
it
was
welded
into
the
living
flesh
.
The
light
beam
had
swept
past
the
vizor
,
showing
only
a
black
,
featureless
hole
where
the
face
should
have
been
.
Delaney
landed
heavily
,
his
head
catching
the
corner
of
a
container
.
For
seconds
he
lay
stunned
,
conscious
only
of
distant
sounds
,
like
the
booming
of
heavy
surf
,
and
the
cries
and
screams
of
laughter
of
the
people
on
the
beach
;
except
the
cries
and
screaming
became
one
,
the
voice
of
Lawton
and
the
booming
surf
was
it
.
Suddenly
the
whole
of
his
existence
was
engulfed
in
an
inferno
of
blinding
blue
light
.
Lawton
died
in
agony
of
the
one
thing
he
had
been
so
afraid
of
;
died
in
an
agony
that
was
self-inflicted
.
Somehow
he
had
pulled
free
the
phosphorus
grenade
,
detonating
it
as
he
held
it
against
the
stinking
flesh
of
the
mercifully
unseen
horror
that
was
ripping
him
apart
.
He
knew
there
was
no
antidote
to
white
phosphorus
,
the
material
would
carry
on
burning
and
penetrating
the
vile
flesh
,
as
it
would
his
own
.
There
was
only
one
way
to
remove
it
.
With
a
bayonet
.
Still
half
concussed
,
Delaney
rolled
upright
and
staggered
.
The
sight
before
him
was
reminiscent
of
a
modernistic
painting
of
Hell
.
Burning
lumps
of
phosphorus
jelly
were
scattered
amongst
the
containers
,
forming
a
foreground
that
was
blinding
.
And
beyond
,
a
nightmare
creature
,
barely
perceived
in
the
swirling
dense
smoke
,
beating
at
the
flames
coming
from
its
own
body
.
In
a
second
it
was
gone
,
only
a
moving
glare
in
the
night
sky
beyond
the
roof
of
a
container
marking
its
progress
.
Delaney
saw
his
bomb
,
snatched
it
up
,
and
ran
.
He
paused
only
the
once
,
gazing
down
at
the
burnt
meat
that
had
been
his
friend
and
comrade
for
so
long
.
He
followed
the
flickering
light
and
the
acrid
smoke
that
drifted
back
,
marking
its
path
in
a
way
that
could
not
be
faked
like
the
bleeper
.
The
roaring
,
bellowing
growls
sometimes
gave
rise
to
screams
of
agony
.
The
moving
glare
stopped
.
He
could
hear
beating
noises
as
he
crept
closer
,
transferring
the
bomb
from
one
sweating
hand
to
the
other
.
Delaney
backed
up
to
the
container
,
began
edging
to
the
corner
.
The
flickering
light
was
fading
;
it
was
winning
its
battle
to
put
out
the
flames
.
He
had
to
do
it
now
,
while
it
was
still
illuminated
.
He
took
a
deep
breath
,
primed
the
fuse
,
and
leapt
around
the
corner
,
arm
raised
.
Its
back
was
to
him
,
flames
still
glowing
deep
in
its
side
.
He
ran
forward
,
scuttled
it
under-hand
between
the
massive
,
spread
legs
,
and
dived
away
to
the
right
,
rolling
and
rolling
,
arms
protecting
his
head
.
The
plastic
went
off
with
a
smack
of
solid
air
that
stabbed
pain
into
his
ears
and
moved
the
container
next
to
him
.
An
orange
ball
of
flame
ripped
up
into
the
sky
,
bathing
the
deck
in
light
like
a
miniature
sun
.
In
that
split
second
Delaney
saw
the
thing
in
its
centre
,
flung
like
a
whirling
gingerbread
man
right
over
a
container
.
Delaney
scrambled
to
his
feet
,
lurching
from
the
effects
of
shock
and
concussion
,
knowing
only
that
he
had
to
be
sure
;
had
to
see
it
dead
.
He
unwound
his
Uzi
,
readying
it
one-handed
as
he
used
the
other
to
support
himself
as
he
rounded
the
corner
.
He
could
still
make
out
the
huge
man-shape
,
lying
face
down
,
its
outline
glowing
from
the
residual
embers
of
the
phosphorus
,
like
a
blackened
,
smoking
tree
trunk
.
He
pointed
the
Uzi
,
pulled
the
trigger
,
Forster
's
words
coming
to
mind
:
"
Watch
out
for
this
one
,
John
.
It
's
not
natural
"
.
The
Uzi
jerked
in
his
hands
.
Six
hundred
rounds
a
minute
thumped
into
the
inert
body
.
There
was
no
spasmodic
jerking
,
nothing
but
the
angry
resurgence
of
the
phosphorus
embers
as
the
bullets
slammed
home
.
He
sprayed
it
all
over
,
hosing
the
stream
of
shells
back
and
forth
;
then
let
the
machine
gun
hang
loose
in
his
hand
.
The
job
was
done
.
He
slumped
down
on
to
his
haunches
,
let
his
body
catch
up
on
itself
.
Delaney
eyed
the
black
mound
with
its
tiny
glowing
stars
that
were
twinkling
and
gradually
dying
out
.
They
were
the
embers
of
Hell
itself
.
It
was
only
then
that
Nell
returned
once
more
to
dominate
his
thoughts
,
and
the
other
weird
creature
she
was
intent
upon
contacting
.
Suddenly
frightened
for
her
,
he
straightened
up
.
But
there
was
something
Forster
had
said
before
he
died
that
Delaney
had
to
check
out
first
.
Cautiously
he
approached
the
smouldering
heap
,
stood
over
it
,
and
wondered
if
he
could
nerve
himself
to
touch
it
in
order
to
turn
it
over
.
Settling
on
his
haunches
beside
the
back
of
the
grotesque
head
,
he
reached
out
a
hand
.
To
Nell
,
it
looked
as
though
she
would
never
find
out
the
last
mystery
of
Titron
.
Piphros
'
vocabulary
was
indeed
limited
and
was
unable
to
cope
with
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
things
she
had
asked
.
And
then
she
struck
lucky
.
"
How
is
Mahon
like
us
?
"
Piphros
waved
a
short
arm
to
indicate
itself
and
Nell
.
"
He
-
shape
-
of
-
man
.
But
-
he
-
part
-
from
-
the
-
sea
.
"
The
sea
?
She
remembered
the
research
submarine
at
the
bottom
of
Titron
.
Slowly
,
she
shook
her
head
,
and
spoke
deliberately
.
"
I
still
do
not
understand
.
"
The
strange
adult
foetus
before
her
grew
agitated
,
the
mouth
working
noiselessly
before
a
faint
sound
emitted
.
The
longish
sentences
were
delivered
robot
fashion
.
"
I
-
was
-
life
-
transmitted
-
on
-
ten
-
twelve
-
eighty
.
"
Now
fighting
for
breath
,
Nell
anxiously
noticed
that
Piphros
had
turned
an
unusual
colour
,
flushing
first
red
then
white
,
rhythmically
,
reminding
her
of
a
pumping
heart
and
vascular
system
of
some
small
translucent
creature
.
"
We
-
come
-
same
-
man
-
fluid
.
Only
-
I
-
am
-
normal
.
"
Nell
swallowed
down
the
revulsion
of
the
word
normal
.
She
guessed
that
what
was
being
said
was
that
Piphros
was
the
control
,
the
experiment
running
alongside
the
real
one
,
that
indicated
the
result
that
could
be
expected
with
a
known
norm
.
Momentarily
she
digested
the
horrible
implication
,
that
by
nineteen-eighty
the
work
on
Titron
had
reached
a
stage
where
an
enlarged
adult
human
foetus
had
presumably
already
been
tested
against
many
diseases
-
and
was
a
norm
.
She
shivered
.
Exhausted
,
Piphros
was
slumped
against
a
wall
,
mouth
working
,
the
while
wheezing
and
bubbling
as
air
was
being
sucked
in
.
Nell
waited
,
struggling
against
her
impatience
and
hunger
for
more
information
.
So
Mahon
was
mythology
made
real
.
A
true
monstrosity
.
A
genetically
constructed
freak
joining
humanity
to
-
what
?
What
was
there
in
the
sea
,
that
vast
untapped
resource
that
covered
nine-tenths
of
the
world
's
surface
,
that
could
be
worth
the
trouble
?
Some
other
intelligence
?
As
far
as
she
knew
porpoises
were
the
most
intelligent
.
Could
that
be
what
Mahon
was
?
A
cross
between
man
and
other
branches
of
mammals
,
that
lived
in
the
sea
?
What
little
she
knew
of
Mahon
did
n't
suggest
that
,
but
what
should
she
expect
when
genes
were
mutilated
by
chemical
or
neutron
bombardment
?
Surely
there
would
have
been
signs
of
porpoise
tanks
or
something
of
that
kind
on
board
,
and
there
was
only
the
diving
equipment
and
the
submersible
research
vehicle
.
Deep
.
Whatever
it
was
they
went
into
the
sea
for
,
it
was
found
way
down
in
its
ice-cold
black
depths
.
And
somehow
that
seemed
appropriate
.
Dolphins
were
happy
,
gregarious
surface
dwellers
.
Mahon
came
from
a
region
they
knew
so
little
about
.
Everything
about
Mahon
reflected
the
inhospitable
,
lonely
depths
.
Mahon
was
a
bleak
,
dangerous
hybrid
.
A
killer
.
Delaney
's
hand
was
on
the
verge
of
touching
the
blackened
,
grotesque
head
when
,
without
warning
,
the
scene
was
bathed
in
the
harsh
,
piercing
light
of
a
flare
.
He
hit
the
deck
,
moulding
himself
into
the
shadow
as
a
matter
of
conditioned
reflex
.
Even
as
he
did
so
six
glistening
,
shiny
black
figures
came
over
the
railing
,
rolling
and
flopping
on
to
the
deck
,
like
excited
seals
.
Only
they
were
men
,
scattering
,
seeking
cover
as
they
moved
towards
the
place
where
he
was
hiding
.
Delaney
watched
them
,
bemused
.
Why
had
Whitehall
sent
in
another
group
?
Were
they
not
going
to
destroy
them
after
all
?
A
surge
of
relief
-
for
himself
,
for
Nell
,
for
the
future
-
pushed
back
the
weariness
of
his
aching
body
.
Only
one
slight
query
remained
.
Why
had
n't
they
signalled
they
were
coming
in
?
He
had
n't
heard
the
aircraft
,
but
that
was
understandable
.
He
'd
been
rather
preoccupied
.
He
pushed
off
from
the
wall
,
stood
up
as
the
leader
,
pointing
at
one
of
his
men
,
issued
a
muffled
order
.
They
saw
him
at
the
same
time
as
he
realised
he
had
n't
understood
what
the
man
had
said
.
No
,
that
was
n't
right
.
He
'd
said
:
"
Left
flank
move
!
"
Only
not
in
English
.
Delaney
's
tired
brain
had
translated
automatically
,
as
it
had
been
trained
to
do
.
The
biting
,
characteristic
crack
of
the
AK47
's
sealed
it
.
He
dived
back
into
cover
as
the
bullets
whined
and
ricocheted
off
the
steel
around
him
.
There
had
n't
been
a
'plane
overhead
for
him
to
hear
.
Or
a
radio
contact
.
These
men
had
come
out
of
the
tubes
of
a
submarine
,
probably
a
Delta
class
.
A
Russian
submarine
.
He
pushed
a
fresh
round
into
the
Uzi
,
and
waited
.
The
flare
sank
lower
;
was
,
he
guessed
,
down
to
about
thirty
seconds
,
when
one
of
the
black
figures
detached
itself
from
the
shadows
.
He
took
careful
aim
,
steadying
the
Uzi
on
a
solid
surface
.
With
a
short
minimal
burst
he
dropped
the
figure
to
the
deck
.
Even
as
the
answering
hail
of
fire
swept
all
around
where
he
had
been
,
he
was
wriggling
away
on
his
stomach
into
an
alleyway
.
Then
he
ran
for
it
.
But
Delaney
was
under
no
illusion
.
Fate
,
it
seemed
,
was
determined
that
Nell
and
he
would
not
have
more
time
.
And
he
could
n't
bear
the
thought
of
her
being
left
alone
with
them
,
when
he
was
killed
.
The
flare
fell
away
to
the
port
side
,
and
went
into
the
sea
.
There
was
a
rustle
and
a
muffled
movement
.
Straining
to
see
,
he
caught
the
sound
of
the
pin
tinkling
to
the
floor
a
second
before
the
metal
object
struck
the
wall
of
the
container
where
he
'd
been
crouching
.
Almost
immediately
there
was
a
dull
thud
as
it
fell
on
the
floor
.
The
grenade
exploded
with
a
yellow
flash
of
light
that
revealed
a
line
of
three
of
them
already
up
on
their
feet
,
firing
from
the
hip
.
Delaney
took
out
the
nearest
,
then
rolled
away
and
sought
new
cover
.
But
there
was
hardly
any
left
,
only
the
long
empty
expanse
from
the
last
container
to
the
door
in
the
super-structure
that
led
down
to
Nell
.
And
as
if
they
knew
it
they
sent
another
flare
up
into
the
sky
,
so
that
it
glowed
bright
and
cheerful
as
a
street
lamp
above
his
path
of
retreat
.
Covering
fire
kept
his
head
down
as
somewhere
flankers
began
their
move
that
would
finally
pin
him
down
.
He
ejected
the
spent
cartridge
,
felt
in
his
ammo
pouch
.
There
was
only
one
left
.
Delaney
's
bomb
had
shaken
through
the
ship
,
vibrating
the
steel
like
a
tuning
fork
.
Piphros
gave
a
worried
squeak
,
eyes
widening
with
fear
.
"
Do
n't
worry
,
"
Nell
tried
to
reassure
.
"
That
's
good
.
It
means
our
people
are
attacking
Mahon
.
He
's
probably
dead
now
.
"
Dead
?
She
could
only
think
and
worry
for
John
.
But
the
explosion
seemed
a
good
sign
:
must
have
been
him
,
and
Lawton
's
and
Forster
's
doing
.
It
had
to
be
.
Dear
God
!
After
this
,
if
there
was
to
be
an
after
,
how
could
she
live
knowing
what
he
might
be
up
to
,
and
the
tight
corners
he
could
be
getting
into
.
Nell
felt
almost
giddy
at
the
way
her
outlook
on
the
future
had
so
dramatically
altered
.
She
'd
known
John
Delaney
for
about
six
months
,
but
the
last
few
hours
had
been
the
catalyst
.
She
dragged
her
thoughts
back
to
the
immediate
.
Piphros
had
given
her
all
the
information
possible
in
a
limited
way
.
What
she
wanted
was
to
get
into
the
laboratory
where
Piphros
had
been
life-commenced
.
She
shuddered
at
the
terminology
.
But
there
,
from
any
notes
,
she
felt
that
she
could
piece
together
what
had
taken
place
.
Nell
repeated
Piphros
'
life-commencement
d
ate
.
"
You
show
me
.
Show
me
where
.
"
The
great
cavernous
mouth
gaped
.
"
Not
-
safe
.
Not
-
safe
.
"
She
felt
guilty
,
especially
as
she
owed
Piphros
her
life
.
But
it
had
to
be
.
She
took
hold
of
the
ill-formed
,
chubby
hand
,
and
encouraged
with
a
hopeful
lie
.
"
Mahon
is
dead
.
Show
me
!
"
The
flare
fell
away
,
drifting
behind
the
funnel
.
Delaney
waited
,
wondering
from
which
direction
the
main
assault
would
come
.
An
AK47
cracked
again
,
keeping
him
down
low
,
and
blind
.
But
the
tracer
was
weaving
from
side
to
side
.
He
guessed
it
was
being
fired
from
the
hip
.
On
the
advance
.
He
was
conscious
of
the
rush
of
warm
fluid
down
on
to
his
lips
,
and
the
salty
taste
of
his
own
blood
.
Delaney
jerked
the
pin
from
a
grenade
,
tossed
it
blindly
in
the
direction
of
the
tracer
.
The
air
ripped
apart
,
a
dying
Russian
falling
like
a
rag
doll
on
to
the
ground
beside
him
.
That
was
close
,
he
thought
.
Too
close
.
He
popped
up
,
triggering
the
Uzi
as
soon
as
he
cleared
the
edge
of
cover
.
Two
more
were
coming
in
.
Delaney
turned
the
already
hosing
gun
on
to
the
nearest
.
The
man
jerked
upright
,
throwing
his
assault
rifle
away
before
collapsing
.
But
their
training
and
reflexes
were
good
.
Under
ordinary
circumstances
he
might
have
got
the
second
but
they
responded
to
his
aggression
with
speed
and
efficiency
,
bottling
him
up
again
with
a
hail
of
bullets
-
bullets
fired
from
very
close
range
.
The
game
was
almost
up
.
Piphros
stopped
again
,
chest
swelling
and
contracting
with
the
effort
.
Nell
looked
around
.
Funny
,
but
even
though
she
knew
Delaney
,
Lawton
and
Forster
were
engaging
Mahon
-
she
could
hear
gun
fire
-
the
empty
shadowy
corridors
of
the
place
gave
her
the
creeps
.
It
was
like
wandering
in
the
lair
of
giant
ants
-
or
something
.
Their
presence
lingered
on
;
or
at
least
Mahon
's
did
.
And
the
missing
army
of
workers
who
had
brought
him
to
life
.
Piphros
moved
again
,
walking
with
a
curious
,
and
uncoordinated
gait
.
They
turned
a
corner
,
and
Nell
understood
.
Should
have
guessed
where
they
were
headed
.
It
was
the
maximum
clear
zone
,
with
the
arrested
bomb
underneath
its
centre
,
and
Forster
's
ambush
point
at
the
entrance
.
As
they
approached
down
the
long
corridor
she
could
see
George
,
the
sacrificial
dummy
,
slumped
over
the
console
:
the
bait
for
Forster
's
trap
.
It
dawned
on
her
then
.
Forster
might
still
be
in
hiding
,
waiting
.
Leaving
only
Delaney
and
Lawton
involved
with
Mahon
.
Although
Piphros
was
in
the
lead
,
Nell
hurried
past
,
and
ran
into
the
room
towards
the
shower
curtain
.
"
Gene
,
"
she
called
,
"
it
's
OK
.
This
is
not
the
one
you
're
after
.
"
There
was
no
reply
.
She
pulled
the
curtain
aside
and
choked
with
the
shock
of
what
she
saw
.
Forster
was
laying
where
they
had
left
him
,
except
the
raw
area
of
his
face
had
turned
into
a
slimy
mess
.
Nell
backed
away
,
unable
to
cope
with
the
double
shock
of
Forster
's
corpse
and
the
foul-looking
thing
growing
on
him
.
She
stumbled
back
and
turned
into
the
reaching
arms
of
a
man-shaped
thing
that
was
coming
down
on
her
.
Screaming
,
Nell
and
the
bio-suit
Forster
had
dubbed
George
rolled
on
to
the
floor
,
locked
in
an
embrace
that
only
ended
when
Nell
hysterically
kicked
it
from
her
.
She
got
to
her
feet
as
Piphros
,
uttering
a
shrill
scream
,
retreated
out
of
the
door
.
"
Wait
.
"
Nell
rushed
to
Piphros
,
and
held
out
a
restraining
hand
.
"
We
're
safe
.
Mahon
has
gone
from
here
.
"
Reluctantly
,
Piphros
allowed
her
to
lead
the
way
past
the
suit
.
"
It
's
empty
,
"
she
said
.
"
Just
fell
on
me
,
that
's
all
.
Look
.
There
's
nobody
inside
.
"
Nell
pointed
at
the
black
empty
vizor
as
they
shuffled
past
the
sprawling
hulk
.
She
thanked
God
that
they
did
n't
have
to
use
the
shower
where
Forster
lay
.
There
was
another
one
.
They
disappeared
from
view
.
Some
twenty
seconds
elapsed
before
the
empty
suit
spasmed
,
then
one
leg
pulled
slowly
up
on
itself
,
as
if
an
inflating
pressure
was
at
work
.
Nell
continued
to
lead
.
There
was
a
master
over-ride
switch
outside
each
of
the
stages
,
allowing
them
to
pass
swiftly
through
until
they
were
at
the
deepest
level
.
She
stood
in
wonderment
,
looking
through
the
great
glass
observation
windows
into
the
centre
of
the
complex
.
Piphros
raised
an
arm
,
and
pointed
.
"
There
-
life
-
commenced
.
"
From
where
she
stood
,
working
access
to
the
most
inner
room
had
been
via
remote
control
arms
and
full-sized
plastic
window-suits
set
in
the
wall
with
their
own
flexi-corridors
that
stretched
out
behind
the
deeper
the
technician
moved
into
the
room
.
In
the
centre
of
the
laboratory
there
was
a
huge
bench
,
fully
equipped
under
powerful
lights
;
the
last
word
in
biological
barrier
working
.
Nell
turned
away
and
began
to
eagerly
search
the
mass
of
notes
,
manuals
and
graphs
stacked
on
desks
.
Piphros
nervously
kept
a
watchful
eye
back
along
the
way
they
had
come
.
Delaney
readied
himself
for
the
final
assault
.
Another
flare
had
just
burst
above
him
.
Now
was
the
time
.
Suddenly
a
black
figure
,
light
from
the
flare
gleaming
along
the
steel
in
his
hand
,
began
his
jump
from
the
roof
of
the
container
behind
him
.
Delaney
rolled
aside
,
and
pulled
the
trigger
.
Nothing
happened
.
The
figure
landed
like
a
cat
,
whirling
,
the
knife
hinging
at
Delaney
's
exposed
belly
.
He
caught
the
man
's
wrist
,
smashed
the
useless
Uzi
at
the
oval
streaked
face
set
in
the
black
rubber
cowl
.
The
Russian
twisted
it
out
of
his
grasp
as
they
rolled
over
and
over
,
locked
in
a
kicking
,
butting
embrace
.
They
crashed
to
a
halt
,
with
Delaney
underneath
.
The
man
increased
his
pressure
,
putting
all
his
weight
behind
the
knife
arm
.
The
tip
of
steel
began
to
inch
nearer
his
throat
.
The
only
sound
was
their
grunting
as
Delaney
willed
strength
into
his
arms
.
The
advancing
tip
slowed
,
trembled
,
and
stopped
.
Their
eyes
met
.
Each
was
aware
that
the
only
outcome
would
be
death
for
one
of
them
.
They
held
for
seconds
,
their
gasping
suddenly
drowned
by
heavy
machine
gun
fire
ending
with
a
scream
from
somewhere
close
by
.
The
Russian
's
strength
ebbed
away
.
Delaney
pushed
him
back
,
slowly
at
first
,
then
with
increasing
ease
,
carrying
on
as
he
rolled
over
the
top
.
The
firing
repeated
,
the
screaming
became
louder
and
nearer
.
Some
part
of
Delaney
's
brain
registered
confusion
.
Had
more
people
come
aboard
?
The
Russian
's
arm
collapsed
,
his
hand
hitting
the
deck
,
as
Delaney
smashed
it
again
and
again
,
feeling
the
bones
crackle
on
the
steel
.
The
knife
spun
free
.
Instantly
,
Delaney
drew
back
his
right
hand
,
stiffened
it
to
chop
down
as
his
left
hand
pulled
at
the
rubber
cowl
on
the
man
's
head
,
forcing
it
back
,
exposing
his
defenceless
windpipe
.
And
then
it
happened
.
A
great
bellow
of
inhuman
rage
froze
his
hand
in
mid
air
.
Nell
Anderson
's
eyebrows
furrowed
in
concentration
.
The
depths
they
had
dived
to
,
that
were
recorded
on
the
sheets
before
her
,
were
exceptional
.
And
always
to
areas
where
the
ocean
floor
dropped
dramatically
;
great
fissures
in
the
rocky
crust
.
From
them
they
had
taken
samples
of
mud
and
sediment
under
the
ledges
,
for
the
bacteria
.
The
names
designated
were
strange
and
totally
new
to
her
.
Then
as
she
scanned
yet
another
sheet
,
full
of
data
,
her
eyes
were
brought
to
a
halt
by
a
red
ball-point
circle
and
exclamation
marks
.
Sample
F/x-01–74482
.
Mahon
fault
.
The
word
Mahon
leapt
out
at
her
.
It
was
a
virus
.
Cross-references
led
her
to
a
file
containing
hundreds
of
individual
dossiers
.
She
took
the
first
one
and
began
to
skim
through
it
,
reading
the
cold
,
scientific
sentences
-
sentences
that
occasionally
broke
out
of
the
narrow
straight-jacket
of
accepted
reporting
,
unable
to
conceal
the
excitement
of
the
men
who
had
written
them
.
Virus
F/x-01–74482
,
soon
referred
to
as
,
simply
,
the
Mahon
virus
was
,
as
far
as
she
could
understand
,
a
unique
example
of
something
that
up
till
now
had
only
been
postulated
:
that
deep
in
the
ocean
,
under
the
terrific
pressure
and
in
temperatures
approaching
absolute
zero
,
there
had
remained
chains
of
biochemicals
,
primitive
viruses
that
had
been
part
of
the
great
"
organic
soup
"
at
the
creation
of
life
,
remaining
unchanged
as
the
rest
of
the
primordial
swamp
had
undergone
the
long
evolutionary
journey
to
form
all
the
complexities
of
life
on
earth
.
And
life
that
included
man
.
She
sat
back
,
visualising
the
scene
as
the
mud
in
the
sample
had
been
examined
by
remote
control
,
and
the
virus
isolated
.
It
would
have
been
handled
,
she
knew
,
with
all
the
caution
that
the
dust
from
the
moon
had
been
,
since
it
might
have
proven
to
be
toxic
as
any
of
the
man-made
monstrosities
aboard
Titron
.
Perhaps
a
plague
as
virulent
as
the
black
death
.
And
then
she
remembered
why
she
was
there
,
because
the
Mahon
virus
had
been
joined
with
humanity
,
had
been
introduced
into
the
genes
as
the
same
batch
of
fluid
that
had
given
life
to
Piphros
.
What
had
they
hoped
to
achieve
?
Why
all
the
concentration
on
genetic
engineering
?
Slowly
and
finally
it
dawned
on
her
.
Radiation
drastically
reduced
the
body
's
resistance
to
infection
.
But
viruses
were
extremely
resistant
;
they
were
incredibly
tough
,
and
able
to
withstand
great
extremes
.
If
only
man
could
be
made
to
-
She
felt
giddy
as
the
full
answer
came
,
crowding
into
her
mind
.
Using
the
cleanest
virus
in
the
world
,
least
changed
by
virtue
of
its
isolation
in
extreme
conditions
,
against
which
the
human
cell
would
have
had
no
natural
experience
,
they
had
inserted
the
Mahon
virus
into
the
molecular
structure
of
the
human
gamete
.
From
Titron
had
come
the
first
man
who
could
withstand
radiation
,
be
it
from
a
bomb
,
or
in
deep
space
.
Evolution
gone
one
stage
further
,
the
next
logical
step
of
the
most
intelligent
animal
on
earth
about
to
go
out
to
the
Universe
.
Self-induced
evolution
,
the
arrival
of
a
new
sub
species
-
Homo
Sapiens
Mahonis
.
Only
unlike
nature
they
'd
got
it
wrong
.
Terribly
wrong
.
The
Russian
,
on
the
point
of
death
,
seized
his
chance
as
Delaney
hesitated
,
reached
out
,
blocking
the
hand
chop
,
attacking
again
,
gouging
at
Delaney
's
eyes
.
Delaney
countered
,
smothering
the
Russian
's
arms
as
he
came
in
close
,
face
inches
from
the
man
's
as
he
yelled
in
Russian
.
"
Enough
!
Listen
!
"
As
he
said
it
the
bellowing
roar
came
again
,
right
on
top
of
them
,
and
a
long
drawn
out
scream
in
Russian
.
Delaney
's
opponent
ceased
struggling
,
looked
wildly
,
unbelievingly
,
at
him
as
they
drew
apart
.
Delaney
took
the
lead
,
carefully
raising
his
head
above
the
edge
of
their
cover
as
the
Russian
,
eyes
still
warily
on
him
,
followed
suit
.
The
sight
shocked
them
both
.
The
back
of
the
awesome
figure
caught
in
the
dying
rays
of
the
flare
was
holding
a
kicking
man
high
above
his
head
,
throwing
him
as
they
watched
over
the
side
and
into
the
sea
.
Another
crumpled
,
broken
body
lay
to
one
side
.
Delaney
could
see
the
huge
,
blistered
areas
where
the
white
phosphorus
had
burned
into
the
flesh
,
the
same
flesh
he
had
blown
and
burned
,
and
shot
to
death
less
than
five
minutes
before
.
With
an
angry
roar
the
creature
turned
,
its
masked
face
searching
.
At
that
moment
,
with
a
shower
of
sparks
as
it
hit
the
superstructure
,
the
flare
died
.
But
in
the
last
surge
of
light
he
'd
seen
beyond
the
reflection
of
the
glass
vizor
-
at
the
horror
within
.
At
the
face
.
It
was
angry
,
distorted
,
and
utterly
disjointed
.
A
parody
,
a
surrealistic
sculpture
in
green
slime
.
A
death
mask
of
pieces
badly
assembled
.
But
it
was
alive
.
It
was
real
.
Seeing
,
as
it
did
,
through
the
closed
eyes
,
as
it
looked
murderously
around
.
It
was
Silk
.
Mercifully
the
sparks
died
and
blackness
descended
,
leaving
the
huge
,
still
glowing
figure
outlined
against
the
lighter
backdrop
of
the
sea
.
The
Russian
swore
,
feverishly
searching
for
a
grenade
.
Still
stunned
,
Delaney
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
found
his
voice
.
"
No
good
.
Come
with
me
.
"
The
Russian
spoke
for
the
first
time
.
And
in
English
.
"
Why
should
I
trust
you
?
"
Delaney
scrambled
to
his
feet
.
He
had
to
get
to
Nell
.
The
shock
of
what
he
'd
just
seen
must
have
still
been
on
his
face
because
he
just
shrugged
and
ran
.
The
Russian
followed
,
shouting
as
they
neared
the
superstructure
door
.
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
Delaney
stabbed
a
finger
downwards
.
"
I
have
one
of
my
team
left
.
A
doctor
.
I
'm
going
to
get
her
out
.
This
ship
is
going
to
be
blasted
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
that
creature
with
it
.
"
There
was
no
time
for
more
.
With
a
roar
,
it
began
to
come
their
way
,
searching
with
its
closed
dead
eyes
set
in
the
grotesque
moving
head
.
Delaney
reached
the
door
,
leapt
through
and
turned
,
shoulder
behind
it
as
the
Russian
joined
him
.
The
man
screamed
as
the
long
tapering
fingers
and
joints
of
a
gauntlet-hand
came
around
the
edge
,
like
the
claws
of
a
huge
crab
.
With
a
last
desperate
heave
the
steel
door
slammed
shut
,
slicing
off
the
row
of
fingers
like
falling
skittles
.
They
dropped
the
catch
as
the
door
quivered
under
an
enormous
blow
,
again
and
again
,
as
the
creature
screamed
its
rage
,
the
half-inch
steel
beginning
to
buckle
.
But
it
held
.
Relieved
,
they
backed
away
,
their
horrified
eyes
falling
to
where
the
amputated
fingers
wriggled
over
the
floor
.
They
just
ran
,
Delaney
leading
,
dropping
from
deck
to
deck
until
they
reached
the
engine
room
ladder
.
Delaney
pulled
up
,
frightened
at
the
sight
of
the
dismembered
barricade
at
the
bottom
,
but
began
shouting
for
her
as
he
dropped
down
.
"
Nell
!
"
He
kicked
the
wreckage
aside
,
and
ran
into
the
empty
engine
room
,
searching
,
as
the
Russian
looked
anxiously
back
up
the
stairway
,
listening
to
the
tremendous
blows
echoing
through
the
ship
.
There
was
one
last
terrific
crash
.
Then
silence
.
The
Russian
turned
to
face
Delaney
.
"
It
's
through
!
"
Delaney
tried
to
work
out
what
had
happened
.
Why
the
door
to
the
engine
room
was
open
and
undamaged
.
But
the
continuing
silence
was
ominous
.
That
the
creature
was
seeking
them
out
was
not
in
doubt
.
If
they
delayed
any
longer
they
'd
be
trapped
.
Delaney
tore
himself
away
,
going
back
up
the
stairway
that
was
the
only
way
out
,
and
back
in
the
direction
that
the
creature
was
coming
.
They
raced
up
the
steps
,
reaching
the
first
deck
,
wheeled
round
,
and
ran
down
the
corridor
.
Delaney
flung
open
the
door
.
With
a
blinding
roar
the
creature
reached
out
.
Delaney
slammed
the
steel
back
into
it
,
and
fled
,
with
the
Russian
ahead
of
him
,
diving
through
an
inspection
hatch
.
Delaney
flung
himself
under
a
deep
shelf
supporting
life
rafts
,
rolling
and
rolling
as
the
crab-like
hand
came
after
him
,
moving
sideways
,
just
missing
his
leg
.
The
fierce
,
distorted
blind
face
of
the
creature
appeared
at
ground
level
,
on
its
side
,
searching
.
When
it
found
him
the
mouth
opened
in
a
roar
of
triumph
,
lips
pulling
apart
behind
the
vizor
to
reveal
huge
yellow
teeth
.
Nell
feverishly
ripped
the
covers
off
three
of
the
files
,
hastily
stuffing
the
insides
into
one
of
her
empty
field-dressing
pouches
.
She
was
about
to
do
the
same
with
the
contents
of
another
file
when
something
made
her
pause
,
hair
prickling
at
the
back
of
her
head
.
She
looked
round
.
There
was
no
sign
of
Piphros
.
Nell
lowered
the
file
,
suddenly
frightened
,
and
still
not
knowing
what
it
was
that
had
disturbed
her
.
Then
it
came
again
.
A
slow
,
shuffling
noise
.
She
tried
to
call
out
,
but
her
voice
was
gone
,
frozen
in
her
paralysed
throat
.
The
shuffling
stopped
,
followed
by
a
long
silence
.
There
was
no
other
way
out
of
that
particular
area
except
through
that
door
,
and
Nell
edged
up
to
it
,
hesitating
at
the
sound
of
the
slithering
,
before
forcing
herself
to
turn
the
corner
.
What
she
saw
made
Doctor
Nell
Anderson
physically
weak
.
The
protection
suit
that
had
been
the
sacrificial
dummy
was
no
longer
that
.
Like
some
mummified
figure
it
was
bending
,
back
to
her
,
over
a
fallen
Piphros
.
A
black
living
slime
seemed
to
be
filling
its
interior
,
flowing
out
like
a
sticky
stream
on
to
Piphros
-
over
the
great
head
,
into
the
mouth
,
gill
slits
,
and
the
surgically-made
holes
of
the
ears
.
Piphros
'
one
big
eye
that
she
could
see
looked
at
her
reproachfully
before
it
was
entered
by
the
moving
,
living
tentacle
of
slime
.
Then
the
masked
head
moved
from
the
neck
of
Piphros
,
turned
slowly
to
look
at
her
.
Nell
clutched
at
her
chest
,
trying
to
stem
the
rising
swell
of
nausea
.
The
black
,
wet
face
pressed
to
the
glass
of
the
vizor
was
constantly
changing
with
the
movement
of
the
slime
.
And
it
looked
like
-
no
,
she
must
be
mistaken
-
like
Forster
.
As
she
watched
,
it
formed
itself
into
a
menacingly
parody
of
his
smile
.
The
mouth
slowly
opened
-
and
there
was
a
sound
like
a
hiss
.
But
there
was
no
mistaking
the
word
.
Nell
.
She
finally
found
her
voice
,
screaming
as
she
bolted
from
the
hideous
life-form
that
was
shaping
even
as
she
watched
into
the
form
,
the
outward
appearance
of
a
dead
human
.
And
a
friend
.
Her
fear
was
more
than
that
for
her
own
life
,
more
than
for
the
way
she
might
die
.
Her
fear
was
for
-
all
mankind
.
The
crab-like
hand
reached
him
,
closed
around
his
belt
,
and
began
to
drag
him
relentlessly
clear
.
Delaney
got
out
his
knife
,
struck
again
and
again
at
the
arm
,
watching
the
blade
plunge
into
the
surface
,
saw
it
ooze
and
close
over
again
.
He
realised
with
a
flash
of
almost
ludicrous
detachment
that
the
hand
that
was
trying
to
grasp
him
was
now
fully
formed
,
and
was
the
one
that
he
had
cut
the
fingers
off
when
slamming
the
steel
door
.
They
had
regenerated
with
incredible
speed
,
comparable
with
that
of
a
bacteria
colony
increasing
in
a
lab
dish
-
doubling
itself
within
hours
.
He
was
dragged
out
into
the
light
,
the
creature
's
awful
,
Silk-resembled
face
,
alive
with
the
movement
of
the
surface
slime
that
quickened
with
expectation
.
Its
other
hand
,
raised
above
him
,
preparing
to
strike
.
In
desperation
,
with
all
his
strength
,
Delaney
plunged
the
knife
straight
into
the
vizored
face
.
It
split
the
glass
,
entered
the
left
closed
eye
,
and
was
buried
right
up
to
the
hilt
.
Immediately
,
the
watching
Russian
jumped
out
,
spraying
a
fire
extinguisher
over
the
creature
's
head
.
It
let
go
of
Delaney
,
screaming
and
clawing
at
its
hooded
eyes
,
as
the
spray
added
layer
upon
layer
of
foam
.
Dazed
,
Delaney
shook
his
head
,
scrambled
to
his
feet
.
The
Russian
threw
the
canister
at
the
creature
,
pushed
Delaney
into
the
inspection
hatch
,
and
climbed
in
after
him
.
It
was
some
kind
of
air
duct
,
the
hot
,
dry
wind
pushing
into
their
faces
as
they
moved
away
from
the
murderous
thundering
noise
.
Something
filled
the
little
window
where
they
had
entered
,
occluded
the
light
coming
from
it
,
the
roar
carrying
up
the
vent
like
thunder
.
They
seemed
to
be
crawling
in
the
tunnel
for
a
lifetime
before
they
found
another
grille
.
Together
they
kicked
it
out
.
Cautiously
,
Delaney
stuck
his
head
through
.
The
corridor
ahead
was
deserted
.
He
pushed
out
his
shoulders
,
and
was
halfway
through
when
the
creature
turned
the
corner
,
coming
upon
him
with
terrifying
speed
.
The
Russian
pulled
Delaney
back
bodily
by
his
legs
,
helping
to
get
him
further
away
as
the
arm
with
its
vicious
,
razor-sharp
ends
,
flailed
wildly
through
the
aperture
.
Fifty
feet
in
they
stopped
,
utterly
exhausted
.
their
chests
heaving
.
In
the
semi-darkness
,
Delaney
could
just
make
out
the
Russian
's
face
.
He
sagged
back
against
the
wall
,
and
held
out
his
hand
.
The
Russian
hesitated
-
then
took
it
.
"
Thanks
.
My
name
's
John
Delaney
.
"
The
grip
was
firm
.
"
Gregor
Andrevitch
.
"
"
I
owe
you
,
"
Delaney
said
with
a
smile
.
The
Russian
shrugged
.
"
You
would
have
done
the
same
for
me
,
"
he
replied
.
It
was
funny
.
But
Delaney
knew
what
he
meant
.
Despite
the
fact
that
they
had
been
trying
to
kill
each
other
,
against
the
creature
they
were
united
.
Instinctively
,
they
were
men
first
,
enemies
second
.
"
What
is
it
?
"
Andrevitch
asked
.
Delaney
grinned
,
a
grim
,
humourless
smile
.
"
Some
sort
of
genetically
engineered
freak
.
Do
n't
you
know
what
it
was
that
you
came
for
?
"
The
Russian
shook
his
head
.
"
No
.
Did
you
?
"
Delaney
acknowledged
the
point
,
then
his
face
darkened
.
"
There
is
n't
all
that
much
time
.
Titron
is
doomed
.
My
people
ca
n't
afford
to
let
it
be
known
what
's
been
going
on
here
.
"
Andrevitch
frowned
.
"
You
mean
-
?
"
"
Yes
.
"
Delaney
finished
for
him
.
"
We
did
n't
know
it
,
but
we
"
re
expendable
.
just
a
holding
unit
.
"
The
Russian
stared
at
him
and
suddenly
understood
.
His
own
background
was
identical
.
Delaney
dragged
himself
along
the
tunnel
.
"
Come
on
,
"
he
urged
,
"
I
've
got
to
find
my
doctor
.
"
Nell
ran
wildly
,
careering
out
of
the
special
unit
down
the
corridor
,
charging
around
blindly
,
corner
after
corner
.
Finally
,
she
stumbled
,
fell
against
a
wall
,
clutching
it
for
support
and
sobbing
.
For
the
very
first
time
in
her
life
she
needed
someone
.
And
that
someone
was
John
Delaney
.
Gradually
she
got
control
of
herself
,
felt
her
heart
beat
slow
down
.
It
was
while
she
was
wiping
her
face
that
she
began
to
get
an
uncanny
feeling
that
she
was
being
watched
.
She
spun
around
,
searching
the
shadowy
dark
corridor
.
Two
of
the
overhead
lights
were
not
working
,
but
she
could
see
the
corridor
was
empty
.
She
looked
back
the
other
way
.
Nothing
.
There
was
a
faint
breathing
sound
,
long
drawn
out
,
with
a
faint
whistling
at
the
end
.
And
it
was
not
too
far
away
.
She
had
a
sudden
flash
of
memory
,
a
childhood
nightmare
after
seeing
a
horror
movie
where
the
cave
walls
had
suddenly
become
alive
with
rock
men
.
And
with
unnerving
certainty
she
knew
that
something
was
in
the
corridor
with
her
-
something
that
blended
its
colour
and
shape
so
perfectly
that
it
was
invisible
.
Trying
not
to
give
the
game
away
she
got
ready
to
run
,
listening
and
endeavouring
to
locate
the
direction
of
the
breathing
.
It
was
impossible
,
almost
like
trying
to
find
a
hedgehog
at
night
.
As
the
breathing
became
louder
,
she
saw
the
suspicion
of
a
shadow
-
a
vague
change
in
the
density
of
light
.
She
ran
for
her
life
,
never
seeing
the
figure
detach
itself
from
the
wall
,
as
she
did
in
that
far
off
childhood
nightmare
.
But
she
heard
Mahon
's
roar
.
She
ran
around
the
corner
and
straight
into
the
arms
of
John
Delaney
,
screaming
before
she
could
stop
herself
.
He
shoved
her
through
the
door
,
slammed
it
,
and
forced
her
down
towards
a
hole
in
the
wall
.
"
Get
in
the
vent
.
"
Another
man
took
her
arm
,
and
pulled
her
roughly
through
.
Delaney
pushed
himself
in
hard
behind
her
,
the
door
bursting
off
its
hinges
as
Mahon
lunged
at
his
disappearing
legs
,
slicking
off
a
chunk
of
rubber
heel
.
They
scrambled
away
to
the
background
noise
of
shrieks
of
impotent
rage
.
And
tearing
steel
.
Delaney
,
Nell
and
Andrevitch
lay
in
the
cramped
area
of
a
bifurcation
of
the
vent
,
dark
,
claustrophobic
,
sweating
-
but
safe
.
Nell
's
lamp
softly
illuminated
their
faces
as
they
held
a
council
of
war
.
Andrevitch
spoke
,
gesticulating
upwards
.
"
We
can
use
a
survival
raft
.
I
have
my
radio
.
My
people
will
pick
us
up
in
the
night
.
"
Grim-faced
,
Delaney
shook
his
head
.
"
It
was
never
intended
that
there
should
be
survivors
.
Whoever
finishes
Titron
will
scan
the
area
to
that
effect
.
"
His
eyes
found
Nell
's
in
ominous
silence
.
She
squeezed
his
arm
,
encouraged
for
his
sake
.
"
There
must
be
something
we
can
do
,
"
she
offered
.
Delaney
turned
to
Andrevitch
.
"
Your
submarine
.
Could
we
swim
out
,
underwater
,
to
it
?
"
The
Russian
shook
his
head
.
"
It
has
pulled
back
several
miles
.
It
will
only
come
closer
around
dawn
.
We
could
not
survive
that
long
.
"
Delaney
nodded
,
but
Nell
shook
his
arm
.
"
We
've
got
our
own
sub
.
We
could
use
that
as
an
escape
vehicle
.
"
Andrevitch
looked
puzzled
.
Delaney
was
sceptical
.
"
Have
you
any
idea
of
the
complexity
of
those
things
?
"
Nell
would
n't
be
put
off
.
"
It
's
worth
a
try
.
We
've
nothing
to
lose
.
"
Andrevitch
turned
to
Delaney
.
"
What
is
this
?
"
Delaney
told
the
Russian
about
the
submersible
in
the
bottom
of
Titron
.
"
You
forget
,
"
Andrevitch
said
,
his
eyes
gleaming
,
"
I
come
from
our
submarine
service
.
"
"
You
think
you
could
drive
it
?
"
Nell
asked
.
Andrevitch
shrugged
.
"
Let's
find
out
.
"
They
stayed
in
the
vent
,
moving
along
it
until
they
came
to
a
down
tunnel
.
The
torch
showed
that
it
was
some
twenty
feet
to
the
bottom
.
One
by
one
they
climbed
in
,
Delaney
first
,
Nell
in
the
middle
,
with
Andrevitch
bringing
up
the
rear
.
It
was
a
tight
,
suffocating
fit
.
And
pitch
black
.
The
torch
was
n't
on
.
Nell
pressed
her
arms
and
legs
outwards
,
slithering
down
in
short
movements
.
Delaney
reached
the
bottom
,
pulled
himself
away
,
then
guided
her
down
.
They
made
room
for
the
Russian
.
Nell
's
disembodied
voice
echoed
in
the
steel
tunnel
.
"
Which
way
?
"
Delaney
pulled
the
torch
from
his
pocket
.
"
My
side
,
"
he
said
.
"
We
go
as
far
down
and
as
near
to
midships
as
possible
.
"
He
switched
on
the
torch
-
and
froze
.
Two
yellow
eyes
were
inches
from
his
face
.
The
rat
was
giant
sized
.
It
leapt
forward
as
Delaney
cried
out
and
struck
it
a
glancing
blow
with
the
torch
.
The
snapping
jaws
missed
,
but
he
felt
its
far
as
it
swung
around
and
scampered
away
.
Delaney
wiped
his
mouth
.
"
Did
you
see
the
size
of
that
?
"
Nell
's
echoing
voice
reached
him
.
"
They
've
been
feeding
on
waste
from
the
labs
.
Full
of
hormones
.
"
They
descended
twice
more
,
then
they
could
find
no
further
down
turns
.
Delaney
stopped
by
a
grille
.
The
two
men
,
working
in
unison
,
kicked
out
the
panel
.
The
noise
seemed
to
reverberate
around
the
ship
.
Delaney
went
first
,
sweating
at
the
half-in
,
half-out
vulnerable
stage
.
Once
through
,
he
crouched
down
,
trying
to
get
his
bearings
.
Andrevitch
came
last
.
Delaney
helped
him
through
then
took
the
lead
.
Nell
noticed
slight
shadowy
changes
at
every
step
.
Found
her
teeth
were
clamped
so
tight
that
her
face
pained
.
She
kept
glancing
behind
them
.
The
corridor
remained
empty
,
as
far
as
she
could
tell
.
Delaney
reached
a
corner
,
and
paused
.
As
Nell
and
Andrevitch
waited
,
Delaney
edged
his
head
round
,
cautiously
.
It
all
looked
innocent
enough
.
The
lift
leading
down
to
the
diving
area
was
only
twenty
feet
away
.
He
waved
them
on
as
he
turned
the
corner
,
and
began
to
run
.
Then
something
stopped
him
.
He
slowed
,
became
wary
again
.
As
soon
as
he
thumbed
the
button
the
door
slid
open
.
Nell
half
expected
to
come
face
to
face
with
Mahon
inside
.
But
thankfully
the
interior
was
bare
.
Delaney
got
in
,
turned
,
hand
on
the
panel
as
Nell
followed
.
Andrevitch
surveyed
the
corridor
for
the
last
time
as
he
backed
in
.
With
a
hiss
,
the
double-sided
door
began
to
close
,
just
as
the
figure
of
Mahon
turned
the
corner
and
came
after
them
at
a
terrifying
speed
.
Once
free
of
the
knotted
tentacles
of
the
eastern
suburbs
,
Dalgliesh
made
good
time
and
by
three
he
was
driving
through
Lydsett
village
.
Here
a
right
turn
took
him
off
the
coastal
road
on
to
what
was
little
more
than
a
smoothly
macadamed
track
bordered
by
water-filled
ditches
and
fringed
by
a
golden
haze
of
reeds
,
their
lumbered
heads
straining
in
the
wind
.
And
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
thought
that
he
could
smell
the
North
Sea
,
that
potent
but
half-illusory
tang
evoking
nostalgic
memories
of
childhood
holidays
,
of
solitary
adolescent
walks
as
he
struggled
with
his
first
poems
,
of
his
aunt
's
tall
figure
at
his
side
,
binoculars
round
her
neck
,
striding
towards
the
haunts
of
her
beloved
birds
.
And
here
,
barring
the
road
,
was
the
familiar
old
farm
gate
still
in
place
.
Its
continued
presence
always
surprised
him
since
it
served
no
purpose
that
he
could
see
except
symbolically
to
cut
off
the
headland
and
to
give
travellers
pause
to
consider
whether
they
really
wanted
to
continue
.
It
swung
open
at
his
touch
but
closing
it
,
as
always
,
was
more
difficult
and
he
lugged
and
half
lifted
it
into
place
and
slipped
the
circle
of
wire
over
the
gatepost
with
a
familiar
sensation
of
having
turned
his
back
on
the
workaday
world
and
entered
country
which
,
no
matter
how
frequent
his
visits
,
would
always
be
alien
territory
.
He
was
driving
now
across
the
open
headland
towards
the
fringe
of
pine
trees
which
bordered
the
North
Sea
.
The
only
house
to
his
left
was
the
old
Victorian
rectory
,
a
square
,
red-brick
building
,
incongruous
behind
its
struggling
hedge
of
rhododendron
and
laurel
.
To
his
right
the
ground
rose
gently
towards
the
southern
cliffs
and
he
could
see
the
dark
mouth
of
a
concrete
pillbox
,
undemolished
since
the
war
,
and
as
seemingly
indestructible
as
the
great
hulks
of
wave-battered
concrete
,
remnants
of
the
old
fortifications
which
lay
half-submerged
in
the
sand
along
part
of
the
beach
.
To
the
north
the
broken
arches
and
stumps
of
the
ruined
Benedictine
abbey
gleamed
golden
in
the
afternoon
sun
against
the
crinkled
blue
of
the
sea
and
,
breasting
a
small
ridge
,
he
glimpsed
for
the
first
time
the
topsail
of
Larksoken
Mill
and
beyond
it
,
against
the
skyline
,
the
great
grey
bulk
of
Larksoken
Nuclear
power
Station
.
The
road
he
was
on
,
veering
left
,
would
lead
eventually
to
the
station
but
was
,
he
knew
,
seldom
used
since
normal
traffic
and
all
heavy
vehicles
used
the
new
access
road
to
the
north
.
The
headland
was
empty
and
almost
bare
,
the
few
straggling
trees
,
distorted
by
the
wind
,
struggled
to
keep
their
precarious
hold
in
the
uncompromising
soil
.
And
now
he
was
passing
a
second
and
more
dilapidated
pillbox
and
it
struck
him
that
the
whole
headland
had
the
desolate
look
of
an
old
battlefield
,
the
corpses
long
since
carted
away
but
the
air
vibrating
still
with
the
gunfire
of
long-lost
battles
,
while
the
power
station
loomed
over
it
like
a
grandiose
modern
monument
to
the
unknown
dead
.
On
his
previous
visits
to
Larksoken
he
had
seen
Martyr
's
Cottage
spread
out
beneath
him
when
he
and
his
aunt
had
stood
surveying
the
headland
from
the
small
top
room
under
the
cone
of
the
mill
.
But
he
had
never
been
closer
to
it
than
the
road
and
now
,
driving
up
to
it
,
it
struck
him
again
that
the
description
"
cottage
"
was
hardly
appropriate
.
It
was
a
substantial
,
two-storey
,
L-shaped
house
standing
to
the
east
of
the
track
with
walls
partly
flint
and
partly
rendered
,
enclosing
at
the
rear
a
courtyard
of
York
stone
which
gave
an
uninterrupted
view
over
fifty
yards
of
scrub
to
the
grassy
dunes
and
the
sea
.
No
one
appeared
as
he
drew
up
and
,
before
lifting
his
hand
to
the
bell
,
he
paused
to
read
the
words
of
a
stone
plaque
embedded
in
the
flints
to
the
right
of
the
door
.
In
a
cottage
on
this
site
lived
Agnes
Poley
,
Protestant
martyr
,
burned
at
Ipswich
,
15th
August
1557
,
aged
32
years
.
Ecclesiastes
chapter
3
,
verse
15
.
The
plaque
was
unadorned
,
the
letters
deeply
carved
in
an
elegant
script
reminiscent
of
Eric
Gill
,
and
Dalgliesh
remembered
his
aunt
telling
him
that
it
had
been
placed
there
by
previous
owners
in
the
late
twenties
,
when
the
cottage
was
originally
extended
.
One
of
the
advantages
of
a
religious
education
is
the
ability
to
identify
at
least
the
better-known
texts
of
scripture
and
this
was
one
which
it
needed
no
effort
of
memory
to
recall
.
As
a
delinquent
nine-year-old
at
his
prep
school
,
he
had
once
been
required
by
the
headmaster
to
write
out
in
his
best
handwriting
the
whole
of
the
third
chapter
of
Ecclesiastes
,
old
Gumboil
,
economical
in
this
as
in
all
matters
,
believing
that
writing
lines
should
combine
punishment
with
literary
and
religious
education
.
The
words
,
in
that
round
childish
script
,
had
remained
with
him
.
It
was
,
he
thought
,
an
interesting
choice
of
text
.
That
which
hath
been
is
now
;
and
that
which
is
to
be
hath
already
been
;
and
God
requireth
that
which
is
past
.
He
rang
and
there
was
only
a
short
delay
before
Alice
Mair
opened
the
door
.
He
saw
a
tall
,
handsome
woman
dressed
with
careful
and
expensive
informality
in
a
black
cashmere
sweater
with
a
silk
scarf
at
the
throat
and
fawn
trousers
.
He
would
have
recognized
her
from
her
strong
resemblance
to
her
brother
,
although
she
looked
the
elder
by
some
years
.
She
took
it
for
granted
that
each
knew
who
the
other
was
,
and
standing
aside
to
motion
him
in
she
said
:
"
It
's
good
of
you
to
be
so
accommodating
,
Mr
Dalgliesh
.
I
'm
afraid
Nora
Gurney
is
implacable
.
Once
she
knew
you
were
on
your
way
to
Norfolk
you
were
a
predestined
victim
.
Perhaps
you
would
bring
the
proofs
through
to
the
kitchen
.
"
It
was
a
distinguished
face
with
the
deep-set
,
widely
spaced
eyes
beneath
straight
brows
,
a
well-shaped
,
rather
secretive
mouth
and
strong
greying
hair
swept
upwards
and
curled
into
a
chignon
.
In
her
publicity
photographs
she
could
,
he
recalled
,
look
beautiful
in
a
somewhat
intimidating
,
intellectual
and
very
English
mould
.
But
seen
face
to
face
,
even
in
the
informality
of
her
own
house
,
the
absence
of
a
spark
of
sexuality
and
,
he
sensed
,
a
deep-seated
reserve
,
made
her
seem
less
feminine
and
more
formidable
than
he
had
expected
,
and
she
held
herself
stiffly
as
if
repelling
invaders
of
her
personal
space
.
The
handshake
with
which
she
had
greeted
him
had
been
cool
and
firm
and
her
brief
smile
was
surprisingly
attractive
.
He
knew
that
he
was
oversensitive
to
the
timbre
of
the
human
voice
and
hers
,
although
not
jarring
or
unpleasant
,
sounded
a
little
forced
as
if
she
were
deliberately
speaking
at
an
unnatural
pitch
.
He
followed
her
down
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
It
was
,
he
judged
,
almost
twenty
feet
long
and
obviously
served
the
triple
purpose
of
sitting
room
,
working
place
and
office
.
The
right-hand
half
of
the
room
was
a
well-equipped
kitchen
with
a
large
gas
stove
and
an
Aga
,
a
butcher
's
chopping
block
,
a
dresser
to
the
right
of
the
door
holding
an
assortment
of
gleaming
pots
,
and
a
long
working
surface
with
a
wooden
triangle
sheathing
her
assortment
of
knives
.
In
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
large
wooden
table
holding
a
stoneware
jar
of
dried
flowers
.
On
the
left-hand
wall
was
a
working
fireplace
,
the
two
recesses
fitted
with
wall-to-ceiling
bookshelves
.
To
each
side
of
the
hearth
was
a
high-backed
wicker
armchair
in
an
intricate
closely
woven
design
fitted
with
patchwork
cushions
.
There
was
an
open
roll-top
desk
facing
one
of
the
wide
windows
and
,
to
its
right
,
a
stable
door
,
the
top
half
open
,
gave
a
view
of
the
paved
courtyard
.
Dalgliesh
could
glimpse
what
was
obviously
her
herb
garden
planted
in
elegant
terracotta
pots
carefully
disposed
to
catch
the
sun
.
The
room
,
which
contained
nothing
superfluous
,
nothing
pretentious
,
was
both
pleasing
and
extraordinarily
comforting
and
,
for
a
moment
,
he
wondered
why
.
Was
it
the
faint
smell
of
herbs
and
newly
baked
dough
,
the
soft
ticking
of
the
wall-mounted
clock
which
seemed
both
to
mark
the
passing
seconds
and
yet
to
hold
time
in
thrall
,
the
rhythmic
moaning
of
the
sea
through
the
half-open
door
,
the
sense
of
well-fed
ease
conveyed
by
the
two
cushioned
armchairs
,
the
open
hearth
?
Or
was
it
that
the
kitchen
reminded
Dalgliesh
of
that
rectory
kitchen
where
the
lonely
only
child
had
found
warmth
and
undemanding
,
uncensorious
companionship
,
been
given
hot
dripping
toast
and
small
forbidden
treats
?
He
placed
the
proofs
on
the
desk
,
refused
Alice
Mair
's
offer
of
coffee
and
followed
her
back
to
the
front
door
.
She
walked
out
with
him
to
the
car
and
said
:
"
I
was
sorry
about
your
aunt
-
sorry
for
you
,
I
mean
.
I
expect
that
for
an
ornithologist
death
ceases
to
be
terrible
once
sight
and
hearing
begin
to
go
.
And
to
die
in
one
's
sleep
without
distress
to
oneself
or
inconvenience
to
others
is
an
enviable
end
.
But
you
had
known
her
for
so
long
that
she
must
have
seemed
immortal
.
"
Formal
condolences
,
he
thought
,
were
never
easy
to
speak
or
accept
and
usually
sounded
either
banal
or
insincere
.
Hers
had
been
perceptive
.
Jane
Dalgliesh
had
indeed
seemed
to
him
immortal
.
The
very
old
,
he
thought
,
make
our
past
.
Once
they
go
it
seems
for
a
moment
that
neither
it
nor
we
have
any
real
existence
.
He
said
:
"
I
do
n't
think
death
was
ever
terrible
to
her
.
I
'm
not
sure
that
I
really
knew
her
and
I
'm
left
wishing
I
'd
tried
harder
.
But
I
shall
miss
her
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
I
did
n't
know
her
either
.
Perhaps
I
should
have
tried
harder
too
.
She
was
a
very
private
woman
,
I
suspect
one
of
those
fortunate
people
who
find
no
other
company
more
agreeable
than
their
own
.
It
always
seems
presumptuous
to
encroach
on
that
self-sufficiency
.
Perhaps
you
share
it
.
But
if
you
can
tolerate
company
,
I
'm
having
a
few
people
,
mostly
colleagues
of
Alex
from
the
power
station
,
to
dinner
on
Thursday
night
.
Would
you
care
to
join
us
?
Seven
thirty
for
eight
.
"
It
sounded
,
he
thought
,
more
like
a
challenge
than
an
invitation
.
Somewhat
to
his
surprise
,
Dalgliesh
found
himself
accepting
.
But
then
the
whole
encounter
had
been
a
little
surprising
.
She
stood
regarding
him
with
a
serious
intensity
as
he
let
in
the
clutch
and
turned
the
car
and
he
had
the
impression
that
she
was
watching
critically
to
see
how
he
handled
it
.
But
at
least
,
he
thought
as
he
gave
a
final
wave
,
she
had
n't
asked
him
whether
he
had
come
to
Norfolk
to
help
catch
the
Whistler
.
Three
minutes
later
he
raised
his
foot
from
the
accelerator
.
Ahead
of
him
,
trudging
along
on
the
left
of
the
path
,
was
a
little
group
of
children
,
the
eldest
girl
wheeling
a
pushchair
with
two
smaller
children
,
one
each
side
of
her
,
clutching
the
bars
.
Hearing
the
noise
of
the
car
she
turned
and
he
saw
a
peaked
,
delicate
face
framed
with
red-gold
hair
.
He
recognized
the
Blaney
children
,
met
once
before
with
their
mother
walking
along
the
beach
.
Obviously
the
eldest
girl
had
been
shopping
:
the
folding
pushchair
had
a
shelf
under
the
seat
lumped
high
with
plastic
bags
.
Instinctively
he
slowed
down
.
They
were
unlikely
to
be
in
real
danger
,
the
Whistler
stalked
at
night
,
not
in
broad
daylight
,
and
no
vehicle
had
passed
him
since
he
left
the
coastal
road
.
But
the
child
looked
grossly
overburdened
and
ought
not
to
be
so
far
from
home
.
Though
he
had
never
seen
their
cottage
he
seemed
to
remember
that
his
aunt
had
told
him
that
it
lay
about
two
miles
to
the
south
.
He
recalled
what
he
knew
about
them
,
that
their
father
earned
a
precarious
living
as
a
painter
whose
innocuous
,
prettified
watercolours
were
sold
in
cafes
and
tourist
shops
along
the
coast
and
that
their
mother
had
been
desperately
ill
with
cancer
.
He
wondered
whether
Mrs
Blaney
was
still
alive
.
His
instinct
was
to
pile
the
children
into
the
car
and
drive
them
home
but
that
,
he
knew
,
was
hardly
sensible
.
Almost
certainly
the
eldest
child
-
Theresa
,
was
n't
it
?
-
had
been
taught
not
to
accept
lifts
from
strangers
,
particularly
men
,
and
he
was
virtually
a
stranger
.
On
an
impulse
he
reversed
the
Jaguar
and
drove
quickly
back
to
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
This
time
the
front
door
was
open
and
a
swathe
of
sunlight
lay
across
the
red-tiled
floor
.
Alice
Mair
had
heard
the
car
and
came
out
to
him
from
the
kitchen
,
wiping
her
hands
.
He
said
:
"
The
Blaney
children
are
walking
home
.
Theresa
is
wheeling
a
pushchair
and
trying
to
cope
with
the
twins
.
I
thought
I
could
offer
a
lift
if
I
had
a
woman
with
me
,
someone
they
know
.
"
She
said
briefly
:
"
They
know
me
.
"
Without
another
word
she
went
back
into
the
kitchen
then
came
out
to
him
,
closed
the
front
door
after
her
without
locking
it
and
got
into
the
car
.
Putting
it
into
gear
,
his
arm
brushed
her
knee
.
He
was
aware
of
an
almost
imperceptible
withdrawing
,
more
emotional
than
physical
,
a
small
delicate
gesture
of
self-containment
.
Dalgliesh
doubted
whether
that
half-imagined
recoil
had
anything
to
do
with
him
personally
,
nor
did
he
find
her
silence
disconcerting
.
Their
conversation
,
when
they
did
speak
,
was
brief
.
He
asked
:
"
Is
Mrs
Blaney
still
alive
?
"
"
No
.
She
died
six
weeks
ago
.
"
"
How
are
they
managing
?
"
"
Not
particularly
well
,
I
imagine
.
But
Ryan
Blaney
does
n't
welcome
interference
.
I
sympathize
.
Once
he
lets
down
his
defences
half
the
social
workers
in
Norfolk
,
amateur
and
professional
,
will
move
in
on
him
.
"
When
they
drew
up
beside
the
little
band
it
was
Alice
Mair
who
opened
the
car
door
and
spoke
.
"
Theresa
,
here
is
Mr
Dalgliesh
to
give
you
all
a
lift
.
He
's
Miss
Dalgliesh
's
nephew
from
Larksoken
Mill
.
One
of
the
twins
had
better
sit
on
my
lap
.
The
rest
of
you
and
the
pushchair
can
fit
into
the
back
.
"
Theresa
looked
at
Dalgliesh
without
smiling
and
said
a
grave
thank
you
.
She
reminded
him
of
pictures
of
the
young
Elizabeth
Tudor
,
the
same
red-gold
hair
framing
a
curiously
adult
face
both
secretive
and
self-composed
,
the
same
sharp
nose
and
wary
eyes
.
The
faces
of
the
twins
,
softer
editions
of
her
own
,
turned
towards
her
questioningly
then
broke
into
shy
smiles
.
They
looked
as
if
they
had
been
dressed
in
a
hurry
and
not
very
suitably
for
a
long
walk
on
the
headland
,
even
in
a
warm
autumn
.
One
wore
a
tattered
summer
dress
in
pink
spotted
cotton
with
double
flounces
,
the
other
a
pinafore
over
a
checked
blouse
.
Their
pathetically
thin
legs
were
unprotected
.
Theresa
was
wearing
jeans
and
a
grubby
sweat
shirt
with
a
map
of
London
's
Underground
across
the
front
.
Dalgliesh
found
himself
wondering
if
it
had
been
brought
back
from
a
school
trip
to
the
capital
.
It
was
too
large
for
her
and
the
wide
sleeves
of
limp
cotton
hung
from
her
freckled
arms
like
rags
thrown
over
a
stick
.
In
contrast
to
his
sisters
,
Anthony
was
over-clad
,
a
bundle
of
leggings
,
jumper
and
a
padded
jacket
topped
with
a
woollen
helmet
with
a
bobble
pulled
well
down
over
his
forehead
,
beneath
which
he
surveyed
their
busyness
,
unsmiling
,
like
a
stout
imperious
Caesar
.
Dalgliesh
got
out
of
the
Jaguar
and
tried
to
extricate
him
from
the
pushchair
,
but
the
anatomy
of
the
chair
momentarily
defeated
him
.
There
was
a
bar
beneath
which
the
child
's
rigid
legs
were
obstinately
stuck
.
The
solid
uncooperative
bundle
was
surprisingly
heavy
;
it
was
like
trying
to
manoeuvre
a
firm
and
rather
smelly
poultice
.
Theresa
gave
him
a
brief
,
pitying
smile
,
dragged
the
plastic
bags
from
beneath
the
seat
then
expertly
freed
her
brother
and
settled
him
on
her
left
hip
while
,
with
the
other
hand
,
she
collapsed
the
pushchair
,
with
a
single
vigorous
shake
.
Dalgliesh
took
the
baby
from
her
while
Theresa
helped
the
children
into
the
Jaguar
and
commanded
with
sudden
fierceness
,
"
Sit
still
.
"
Anthony
,
recognizing
incompetence
,
grasped
Dalgliesh
's
hair
firmly
with
a
sticky
hand
and
he
felt
the
momentary
touch
of
a
cheek
,
so
soft
that
it
was
like
the
fall
of
a
petal
.
Throughout
these
manoeuvrings
Alice
Mair
sat
quietly
watching
from
the
car
but
made
no
move
to
help
.
It
was
impossible
to
know
what
she
was
thinking
.
But
once
the
Jaguar
had
moved
away
she
turned
to
Theresa
and
said
in
a
voice
of
surprising
gentleness
:
"
Does
your
father
know
that
you
're
out
alone
?
"
"
Daddy
has
taken
the
van
to
Mr
Sparks
.
It
's
due
for
its
MOT
test
.
Mr
Sparks
does
n't
think
it
's
going
to
pass
.
And
I
found
we
'd
run
out
of
milk
for
Anthony
.
We
have
to
have
milk
.
And
we
wanted
some
more
disposable
nappies
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
I
'm
giving
a
dinner
party
on
Thursday
evening
.
If
your
father
agrees
,
would
you
like
to
come
and
help
with
the
table
like
you
did
last
month
?
"
"
What
are
you
going
to
cook
,
Miss
Mair
?
"
"
Put
your
head
close
so
that
I
can
whisper
.
Mr
Dalgliesh
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
guests
.
I
want
it
to
be
a
surprise
.
"
The
pale
golden
head
leaned
forward
towards
the
grey
and
Miss
Mair
whispered
.
Theresa
smiled
and
then
nodded
with
serious
satisfaction
in
a
moment
of
grave
feminine
conspiracy
.
It
was
Alice
Mair
who
directed
him
to
the
cottage
.
After
about
a
mile
they
turned
seaward
and
the
Jaguar
lurched
and
bounced
down
a
narrow
track
between
high
,
untended
hedges
of
bramble
and
elderberry
.
The
track
led
only
to
Scudder
's
Cottage
,
the
name
crudely
painted
on
a
board
nailed
to
the
gate
.
Beyond
the
cottage
it
widened
to
provide
a
rough
,
gravelled
turning
,
backed
by
a
forty-foot
bank
of
shingle
behind
which
Dalgliesh
could
hear
the
crash
and
suck
of
the
tide
.
Scudder
's
Cottage
,
small-windowed
,
picturesque
under
its
tiled
,
dipping
roof
,
was
fronted
by
a
flowering
wilderness
which
had
once
been
a
garden
.
Theresa
led
the
way
,
between
grass
almost
knee-high
bordered
by
a
riot
of
unpruned
roses
,
to
the
porch
,
then
reached
for
a
key
hung
high
on
a
nail
,
less
,
Dalgliesh
supposed
,
for
security
reasons
than
to
ensure
that
it
was
n't
lost
.
With
Dalgliesh
carrying
Anthony
they
passed
into
the
cottage
.
It
was
much
lighter
than
he
had
expected
,
largely
because
of
a
rear
door
,
now
open
,
which
led
to
a
glass
extension
giving
a
view
of
the
headland
.
He
was
aware
of
the
room
's
clutter
,
the
central
wooden
table
still
covered
with
the
remains
of
their
midday
meal
,
an
assortment
of
plates
smeared
with
tomato
sauce
,
a
half-eaten
sausage
,
a
large
bottle
of
orangeade
uncapped
;
the
children
's
clothes
thrown
over
the
back
of
a
low
nursing
chair
before
the
fireplace
,
of
the
smell
of
milk
and
bodies
and
wood
smoke
.
But
what
held
his
attention
was
a
large
oil
painting
propped
on
a
chair
and
fronting
the
door
.
It
was
a
three-quarter
portrait
in
oils
of
a
woman
,
painted
with
remarkable
power
.
It
dominated
the
room
so
that
he
and
Alice
Mair
stood
for
a
moment
,
silently
regarding
it
.
The
painter
had
avoided
caricature
,
if
only
just
,
but
the
portrait
was
,
he
felt
,
intended
less
as
a
physical
likeness
than
an
allegory
.
Behind
the
wide
,
full
mouth
,
the
arrogant
stare
of
the
eyes
,
the
dark
,
crimped
,
Pre-Raphaelite
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
,
was
a
careful
delineation
of
the
headland
,
its
objects
disposed
and
painted
with
the
meticulous
attention
to
detail
of
a
sixteenth-century
primitive
;
the
Victorian
rectory
,
the
ruined
abbey
,
the
half-demolished
pillbox
,
the
crippled
trees
,
the
small
white
mill
like
a
child
's
toy
and
,
gaunt
against
a
flaming
evening
sky
,
the
stark
outline
of
the
power
station
.
But
it
was
the
woman
,
painted
more
freely
,
who
dominated
the
landscape
,
arms
stretched
,
the
palms
facing
outwards
in
a
parody
of
blessing
.
Dalgliesh
's
private
verdict
was
that
it
was
technically
brilliant
,
but
overwrought
and
painted
,
he
felt
,
in
hatred
.
Blaney
's
intention
to
produce
a
study
of
evil
was
as
clear
as
if
the
portrait
had
been
labelled
.
It
was
so
different
from
the
artist
's
usual
work
that
without
the
bold
signature
,
the
single
surname
,
Dalgliesh
might
have
wondered
if
it
was
,
in
fact
,
his
work
.
He
recalled
Blaney
's
pallid
and
innocuous
watercolours
of
the
better-known
beauty
spots
of
Norfolk
:
Blakeney
,
St
Peter
Mancroft
and
the
cathedral
at
Norwich
,
which
he
produced
for
the
local
shops
.
They
could
have
been
painted
from
picture
postcards
and
probably
were
.
And
he
could
recall
seeing
one
or
two
small
oils
hung
in
local
restaurants
and
pubs
,
slap-dash
in
technique
and
economical
of
paint
,
but
so
different
from
the
prettified
watercolours
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
they
too
were
by
the
same
hand
.
But
this
portrait
was
different
from
either
;
the
wonder
was
that
the
artist
who
could
produce
this
disciplined
splurge
of
colour
,
this
technical
artistry
and
imagination
,
had
been
content
to
churn
out
meretricious
souvenirs
for
the
tourist
trade
.
"
You
did
n't
know
I
could
do
it
,
did
you
?
"
Absorbed
in
the
painting
,
their
ears
had
n't
caught
his
almost
silent
approach
through
the
open
door
.
He
moved
round
and
joined
them
and
stared
intently
at
the
portrait
as
if
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
.
His
daughters
,
as
though
obedient
to
some
unspoken
command
,
grouped
themselves
around
him
in
what
in
older
children
could
have
been
a
conscious
gesture
of
family
solidarity
.
Dalgliesh
had
last
seen
Blaney
six
months
earlier
splashing
alone
along
the
edge
of
the
beach
,
painting
gear
slung
over
his
shoulder
,
and
was
shocked
by
the
change
in
the
man
.
He
stood
a
gaunt
six
foot
three
in
his
torn
jeans
,
the
checked
,
woollen
shirt
open
almost
to
the
waist
,
his
long
grubby
feet
in
the
open
sandals
looking
like
dry
,
brown
bones
.
His
face
was
a
picture
of
red
ferocity
,
the
straggling
red
hair
and
beard
,
the
bloodshot
eyes
,
the
gaunt-featured
face
burnt
red
by
wind
and
sun
,
which
yet
showed
on
the
cheekbones
and
under
the
eyes
the
bruising
stain
of
tiredness
.
Dalgliesh
saw
Theresa
slip
her
hand
into
his
while
one
of
the
twins
moved
closer
to
him
and
clasped
both
arms
firmly
round
one
of
his
legs
.
Dalgliesh
thought
that
however
ferocious
he
might
appear
to
the
outside
world
his
children
had
no
fear
of
him
.
Alice
Mair
said
calmly
:
"
Good
afternoon
,
Ryan
,
"
but
did
not
appear
to
expect
an
answer
.
She
nodded
towards
the
portrait
and
went
on
:
"
It
's
remarkable
,
certainly
.
What
are
you
proposing
to
do
with
it
?
I
can
hardly
suppose
that
she
sat
for
you
or
that
it
was
commissioned
.
"
"
She
did
n't
need
to
sit
.
I
know
that
face
.
I
'm
showing
it
at
the
Norwich
Contemporary
Arts
Exhibition
on
October
the
third
if
I
can
get
it
there
.
The
van
is
out
of
use
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
I
'll
be
driving
to
London
within
the
next
week
.
I
could
collect
it
and
deliver
it
if
you
let
me
have
the
address
.
"
He
said
:
"
If
you
like
.
"
The
response
was
ungracious
but
Dalgliesh
thought
he
detected
relief
.
Then
he
added
:
"
I
'll
leave
it
packed
and
labelled
to
the
left
of
the
door
in
the
painting
shed
.
The
light
is
just
above
it
.
You
can
collect
it
whenever
it
suits
you
.
No
need
to
knock
.
"
The
last
words
had
the
force
of
a
command
,
almost
of
a
warning
.
Miss
Mair
said
:
"
I
'll
telephone
you
when
I
know
when
I
'm
going
.
By
the
way
,
I
do
n't
think
you
've
met
Mr
Dalgliesh
.
He
saw
the
children
on
the
road
and
thought
of
giving
them
a
lift
.
"
Blaney
did
n't
say
thank
you
,
but
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
held
out
his
hand
which
Dalgliesh
grasped
.
Then
he
said
gruffly
,
"
I
liked
your
aunt
.
She
telephoned
offering
to
help
when
my
wife
was
ill
and
when
I
said
there
was
nothing
she
or
anyone
could
do
,
she
did
n't
keep
fussing
.
Some
people
ca
n't
keep
away
from
a
deathbed
.
Like
the
Whistler
,
they
get
their
kicks
from
watching
people
die
.
"
"
No
,
"
said
Dalgliesh
,
"
she
never
fussed
.
I
shall
miss
her
.
I
'm
sorry
about
your
wife
.
"
Blaney
did
n't
reply
,
but
stared
hard
at
Dalgliesh
as
if
assessing
the
sincerity
of
that
simple
statement
,
and
then
said
curtly
,
"
Thank
you
for
helping
the
children
,
"
and
lifted
his
son
from
Dalgliesh
's
shoulder
.
It
was
a
clear
gesture
of
dismissal
.
Neither
of
them
spoke
as
Dalgliesh
negotiated
the
track
and
finally
turned
on
to
the
higher
road
.
It
was
as
if
the
cottage
had
exerted
some
spell
which
it
was
important
to
throw
off
before
they
talked
.
Then
he
asked
:
"
Who
is
that
woman
in
the
portrait
?
"
"
I
had
n't
realized
that
you
did
n't
know
.
Hilary
Robarts
.
She
's
Acting
Administrative
Officer
at
the
power
station
.
Actually
you
'll
meet
her
at
dinner
on
Thursday
night
.
She
bought
Scudder
's
Cottage
when
she
first
arrived
here
three
years
ago
.
She
's
been
trying
to
get
the
Blaneys
out
for
some
time
.
There
's
been
a
certain
amount
of
feeling
about
it
locally
.
"
Dalgliesh
asked
:
"
Why
does
she
want
to
gain
possession
?
Does
she
propose
to
live
there
?
"
"
I
do
n't
imagine
so
.
I
think
she
bought
it
as
an
investment
and
wants
to
sell
.
Even
a
remote
cottage
-
particularly
a
remote
cottage
-
has
value
on
this
coast
.
And
she
has
some
justice
on
her
side
.
Blaney
did
say
that
his
tenancy
would
be
short-term
.
I
think
she
feels
a
certain
resentment
that
he
used
his
wife
's
illness
,
her
death
,
and
now
uses
the
children
as
an
excuse
for
reneging
on
his
undertaking
to
leave
when
she
wanted
the
cottage
back
.
"
Dalgliesh
was
interested
that
Alice
Mair
apparently
knew
so
much
about
local
affairs
.
He
had
thought
of
her
as
essentially
a
private
woman
who
would
be
very
little
concerned
with
her
neighbours
or
their
problems
.
And
what
about
himself
?
In
his
deliberations
whether
to
sell
or
keep
on
the
mill
as
a
holiday
home
he
had
seen
it
as
a
refuge
from
London
,
eccentric
and
remote
,
providing
a
temporary
escape
from
the
demands
of
his
job
and
the
pressures
of
success
.
But
how
far
,
even
as
an
occasional
visitor
,
could
he
isolate
himself
from
the
community
,
from
their
private
tragedies
no
less
than
their
dinner
parties
?
It
would
be
simple
enough
to
avoid
their
hospitality
given
sufficient
ruthlessness
and
he
had
never
lacked
that
when
it
came
to
safeguarding
his
privacy
.
But
the
less
tangible
demands
of
neighbourliness
might
be
less
easily
shrugged
away
.
It
was
in
London
that
you
could
live
anonymously
,
could
create
your
own
ambience
,
could
deliberately
fabricate
the
persona
which
you
chose
to
present
to
the
world
.
In
the
country
you
lived
as
a
social
being
and
at
the
valuation
of
others
.
So
he
had
lived
in
childhood
and
adolescence
in
the
same
country
rectory
,
taking
part
each
Sunday
in
a
familiar
liturgy
which
reflected
,
interpreted
,
and
sanctified
the
changing
seasons
of
the
farming
year
.
It
was
a
world
he
had
relinquished
with
small
regret
and
he
had
not
expected
to
find
it
again
on
Larksoken
headland
.
But
some
of
its
obligations
were
here
,
deep-rooted
even
in
this
arid
and
unfertile
earth
.
His
aunt
had
lived
as
privately
as
any
woman
he
knew
,
but
even
she
had
visited
and
tried
to
help
the
Blaneys
.
He
thought
of
the
man
,
bereft
and
incarcerated
in
that
cluttered
cottage
behind
the
great
dyke
of
shingle
,
listening
night
after
night
to
the
never-ceasing
moaning
of
the
tide
,
and
brooding
on
the
wrongs
,
real
or
imaginary
,
which
could
inspire
that
hate-filled
portrait
.
It
could
hardly
be
healthy
for
him
or
for
his
children
.
Come
to
that
,
he
thought
grimly
,
it
could
hardly
be
healthy
for
Hilary
Robarts
.
He
asked
:
"
Does
he
get
much
official
help
with
the
children
?
It
ca
n't
be
easy
.
"
As
much
as
he
's
prepared
to
tolerate
.
The
local
authority
has
arranged
for
the
twins
to
attend
some
kind
of
daycare
centre
.
They
get
collected
most
days
.
And
Theresa
,
of
course
,
is
at
school
.
She
catches
the
bus
at
the
end
of
the
lane
.
She
and
Ryan
between
them
cope
with
the
baby
.
Meg
Dennison
-
she
housekeeps
for
the
Reverend
and
Mrs
Copley
at
the
Old
Rectory
-
thinks
we
ought
to
do
more
for
them
but
it
's
difficult
to
see
precisely
what
.
As
an
ex-schoolmistress
I
should
have
thought
she
'd
had
her
fill
of
children
and
I
make
no
pretence
at
understanding
them
.
"
Dalgliesh
remembered
her
whispered
confidence
to
Theresa
in
the
car
,
the
child
's
intent
face
and
brief
transforming
smile
,
and
thought
that
she
understood
one
child
at
least
far
better
than
she
would
probably
claim
.
But
his
thoughts
returned
to
the
portrait
.
He
said
:
"
It
must
be
uncomfortable
,
particularly
in
a
small
community
,
to
be
the
object
of
so
much
malevolence
.
"
She
understood
at
once
what
he
meant
.
"
Hatred
rather
than
malevolence
,
would
n't
you
say
?
Uncomfortable
and
rather
frightening
.
Not
that
Hilary
Robarts
is
easily
frightened
.
But
she
's
becoming
something
of
an
obsession
with
Ryan
,
particularly
since
his
wife
's
death
.
He
chooses
to
believe
that
Hilary
practically
badgered
her
into
her
grave
.
It
's
understandable
,
I
suppose
.
Human
beings
need
to
find
someone
to
blame
both
for
their
misery
and
for
their
guilt
.
Hilary
Robarts
makes
a
convenient
scapegoat
.
"
It
was
a
disagreeable
story
and
coming
as
it
did
after
the
impact
of
the
portrait
it
provoked
in
Dalgliesh
a
mixture
of
depression
and
foreboding
which
he
tried
to
shake
off
as
irrational
.
He
was
glad
to
let
the
subject
drop
and
they
drove
in
silence
until
he
left
her
at
the
gate
of
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
To
his
surprise
she
held
out
her
hand
and
gave
him
,
once
again
,
that
extraordinary
,
attractive
smile
.
"
I
'm
glad
you
stopped
for
the
children
.
I
'll
see
you
,
then
,
on
Thursday
night
.
You
will
be
able
to
make
your
own
assessment
of
Hilary
Robarts
and
compare
the
portrait
with
the
woman
.
"
As
the
Jaguar
crested
the
headland
Neil
Pascoe
was
dumping
rubbish
into
one
of
the
two
dustbins
outside
the
caravan
,
two
plastic
bags
of
empty
tins
of
soup
and
baby
food
,
soiled
disposable
napkins
,
vegetable
peelings
and
squashed
cartons
,
already
malodorous
despite
his
careful
sealing
of
the
bags
.
Firmly
replacing
the
lid
he
marvelled
,
as
he
always
did
,
at
the
difference
one
girl
and
an
eighteen-month-old
baby
could
make
to
the
volume
of
household
waste
.
Climbing
back
into
the
caravan
,
he
said
:
"
A
Jag
has
just
passed
.
It
looks
as
if
Miss
Dalgliesh
's
nephew
is
back
.
"
Amy
,
fitting
a
recalcitrant
new
ribbon
to
the
ancient
typewriter
,
did
n't
bother
to
look
up
.
"
The
detective
.
Perhaps
he
's
come
to
help
catch
the
Whistler
.
"
"
That
is
n't
his
job
.
The
Whistler
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
Met
Police
.
It
's
probably
just
a
holiday
.
Or
perhaps
he
's
here
to
decide
what
to
do
with
the
mill
.
He
can
hardly
live
here
and
work
in
London
.
"
"
So
why
do
n't
you
ask
him
if
we
can
have
it
?
Rent-free
,
of
course
.
We
could
caretake
,
see
that
no
one
squats
.
You
're
always
saying
it
's
antisocial
for
people
to
have
second
homes
or
leave
property
empty
.
Go
on
,
have
a
word
with
him
.
I
dare
you
.
Or
I
will
if
you
're
too
scared
.
"
It
was
,
he
knew
,
less
a
suggestion
than
a
half-serious
threat
.
But
for
a
moment
,
gladdened
by
her
easy
assumption
that
they
were
a
couple
,
that
she
was
n't
thinking
of
leaving
him
,
he
actually
entertained
the
idea
as
a
feasible
solution
to
all
their
problems
.
Well
,
almost
all
.
But
a
glance
round
the
caravan
restored
him
to
reality
.
It
was
becoming
difficult
to
remember
how
it
had
looked
fifteen
months
ago
,
before
Amy
and
Timmy
had
entered
his
life
;
the
homemade
shelves
of
orange
boxes
ranged
against
the
wall
which
had
held
his
books
,
the
two
mugs
,
two
plates
and
one
soup
bowl
,
which
had
been
adequate
for
his
needs
,
neatly
stacked
in
the
cupboard
,
the
excessive
cleanliness
of
the
small
kitchen
and
lavatory
,
his
bed
smooth
under
the
coverlet
of
knitted
woollen
squares
,
the
single
hanging
cupboard
which
had
been
sufficient
for
his
meagre
wardrobe
,
his
other
possessions
boxed
and
tidily
stowed
in
the
chest
under
the
seat
.
It
was
n't
that
Amy
was
dirty
;
she
was
continually
washing
herself
,
her
hair
,
her
few
clothes
.
He
Spent
hours
carrying
water
from
the
tap
outside
Cliff
Cottage
to
which
they
had
access
.
He
was
continually
having
to
fetch
new
Calor-gas
cylinders
from
the
general
store
in
Lydsett
village
and
steam
from
the
almost
constantly
boiling
kettle
made
the
caravan
a
damp
mist
.
But
she
was
chronically
untidy
;
her
clothes
lying
where
she
had
dropped
them
,
shoes
kicked
under
the
table
,
knickers
and
bras
stuffed
beneath
cushions
and
Timmy
's
toys
littering
the
floor
and
table
top
.
The
make-up
,
which
seemed
to
be
her
sole
extravagance
,
cluttered
the
single
shelf
in
the
cramped
shower
and
he
would
find
half-empty
,
opened
jars
and
bottles
in
the
food
cupboard
.
He
smiled
as
he
pictured
Commander
Adam
Dalgliesh
,
that
no
doubt
fastidious
widower
,
making
his
way
through
the
accumulated
mess
to
discuss
their
suitability
as
caretakers
at
Larksoken
Mill
.
And
then
there
were
the
animals
.
She
was
incurably
sentimental
about
wildlife
and
they
were
seldom
without
some
maimed
,
deserted
or
starving
creatures
.
Seagulls
,
their
wings
covered
with
oil
,
were
cleansed
,
caged
and
then
let
free
.
There
had
been
a
stray
mongrel
whom
they
had
named
Herbert
,
with
a
large
uncoordinated
body
and
look
of
lugubrious
disapproval
who
had
attached
himself
to
them
for
a
few
weeks
and
whose
voracious
appetite
for
dog-meat
and
biscuits
had
had
a
ruinous
effect
on
the
housekeeping
.
Happily
Herbert
had
eventually
trotted
off
and
to
Amy
's
distress
had
been
seen
no
more
,
although
his
lead
still
hung
on
the
caravan
door
,
a
limp
reminder
of
her
bereavement
.
And
now
there
were
the
two
black
and
white
kittens
found
abandoned
on
the
grass
verge
of
the
coast
road
as
they
came
back
in
the
van
from
Ipswich
.
Amy
had
screamed
for
him
to
stop
and
,
scooping
up
the
kittens
,
had
thrown
back
her
head
and
howled
obscenities
at
the
cruelty
of
human
beings
.
They
slept
on
Amy
's
bed
,
drank
indiscriminately
from
any
saucer
of
milk
or
tea
put
down
for
them
,
were
remarkably
docile
under
Timmy
's
boisterous
caresses
and
,
happily
,
seemed
content
with
the
cheapest
kind
of
tinned
cat
food
.
But
he
was
glad
to
have
them
because
they
too
seemed
to
offer
some
assurance
that
Amy
would
stay
.
He
had
found
her
-
and
he
used
the
word
much
as
he
might
of
finding
a
particularly
beautiful
sea-washed
stone
-
one
late
June
afternoon
the
previous
year
.
She
had
been
sitting
on
the
shingle
staring
out
to
sea
,
her
arms
clasped
round
her
knees
,
Timmy
lying
asleep
on
the
small
rug
beside
her
.
He
was
wearing
a
blue
fleecy
sleeping
suit
embroidered
with
ducks
from
which
his
round
face
seemed
to
have
spilled
over
,
still
and
pink
as
a
porcelain
,
Painted
doll
,
the
delicate
lashes
brush-tipped
on
the
plump
cheeks
.
And
she
,
too
,
had
something
of
the
precision
and
contrived
charm
of
a
doll
with
an
almost
round
head
poised
"
on
a
long
delicate
neck
,
a
snub
nose
with
a
splatter
of
freckles
,
a
small
mouth
with
a
full
upper
lip
beautifully
curved
and
a
bristle
of
cropped
hair
,
originally
fair
but
with
bright
orange
tips
which
caught
the
sun
and
trembled
in
the
breeze
so
that
the
whole
head
seemed
for
a
moment
to
have
a
vivid
life
separated
from
the
rest
of
her
body
and
,
the
image
changing
,
he
had
seen
her
as
a
bright
exotic
flower
.
He
could
remember
every
detail
of
that
first
meeting
.
She
had
been
wearing
blue
faded
jeans
,
and
a
white
sweat
shirt
flattened
against
the
pointed
nipples
and
the
upturned
breasts
;
the
cotton
seeming
too
thin
a
protection
against
the
freshening
onshore
breeze
.
As
he
approached
tentatively
,
wanting
to
seem
friendly
but
not
to
alarm
her
,
she
had
turned
on
him
a
long
and
curious
glance
from
remarkable
,
slanted
,
violet-blue
eyes
.
Standing
over
her
,
he
had
said
:
"
My
name
's
Neil
Pascoe
.
I
live
in
that
caravan
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
.
I
'm
just
going
to
make
some
tea
.
I
wondered
if
you
"
d
like
a
mug
.
"
"
I
do
n't
mind
,
if
you
're
making
it
.
"
She
had
turned
away
at
once
and
gazed
again
out
to
sea
.
Five
minutes
later
he
had
slithered
down
the
sandy
cliffs
,
a
mug
of
tea
slopping
in
each
hand
.
He
heard
himself
say
:
"
May
I
sit
down
?
"
"
Please
yourself
.
The
beach
is
free
.
"
So
he
had
lowered
himself
to
sit
beside
her
and
together
they
had
stared
wordlessly
towards
the
horizon
.
Looking
back
on
it
he
was
amazed
both
at
his
boldness
and
at
the
seeming
inevitability
and
naturalness
of
that
first
encounter
.
It
was
several
minutes
before
he
had
found
the
courage
to
ask
her
how
she
had
got
to
the
beach
.
She
had
shrugged
.
"
By
bus
to
the
village
and
then
I
walked
.
"
"
It
was
a
long
way
carrying
the
baby
.
"
"
I
'm
used
to
walking
a
long
way
carrying
the
baby
.
"
And
then
,
under
his
hesitant
questioning
,
the
story
had
come
out
,
told
by
her
without
self-pity
,
almost
,
it
had
seemed
,
without
particular
interest
,
as
if
the
events
had
happened
to
someone
else
.
It
was
not
,
he
supposed
,
an
unusual
tale
.
She
was
living
in
one
of
the
small
private
hotels
in
Cromer
on
Social
Security
.
She
had
been
in
a
squat
in
London
but
had
thought
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
some
sea
air
for
the
baby
for
the
summer
.
Only
it
was
n't
working
out
.
The
woman
at
the
hotel
did
n't
really
want
kids
and
with
summer
holidays
approaching
could
get
a
better
rate
for
her
rooms
.
She
did
n't
think
she
could
be
turned
out
,
but
she
was
n't
going
to
stay
,
not
with
that
bitch
.
He
asked
:
"
Could
n't
the
baby
's
father
help
?
"
"
He
has
n't
got
a
father
.
He
did
have
a
father
-
I
mean
,
he
is
n't
Jesus
Christ
.
But
he
has
n't
got
one
now
.
"
"
Do
you
mean
that
he
's
dead
or
that
he
's
gone
away
?
"
"
Could
be
either
,
could
n't
it
?
Look
,
if
I
knew
who
he
was
I
might
know
where
he
was
,
OK
?
"
Then
there
had
been
another
science
during
which
she
took
periodical
gulps
of
her
tea
and
the
sleeping
baby
stirred
and
gave
small
pig-like
grunts
.
After
a
few
minutes
he
had
spoken
again
.
"
Look
,
if
you
ca
n't
find
anywhere
else
in
Cromer
you
can
share
the
caravan
for
a
time
.
"
He
had
added
hastily
:
"
I
mean
,
there
is
a
second
bedroom
.
It
's
very
small
,
only
just
room
for
the
bunk
,
but
it
would
do
for
a
time
.
I
know
it
's
isolated
here
but
it
's
close
to
the
beach
which
would
be
nice
for
the
baby
.
"
She
had
turned
on
him
again
that
remarkable
glance
in
which
for
the
first
time
he
had
detected
to
his
discomfiture
a
brief
flash
of
intelligence
and
of
calculation
.
"
All
right
,
"
she
said
.
"
If
I
ca
n't
find
anywhere
else
I
'll
come
back
And
he
had
lain
awake
late
that
night
half
hoping
,
half
dreading
that
she
would
return
.
And
she
had
returned
the
following
afternoon
,
carrying
Timmy
on
her
hip
and
the
rest
of
her
possessions
in
a
backpack
.
She
had
taken
over
the
caravan
and
his
life
.
He
did
n't
know
whether
what
he
felt
for
her
was
love
,
affection
or
pity
,
or
a
mixture
of
all
three
.
He
only
knew
that
in
his
anxious
and
over-concerned
life
his
second
greatest
fear
was
that
she
might
leave
.
He
had
lived
in
the
caravan
now
for
just
over
two
years
,
supported
by
a
research
grant
from
his
northern
university
to
study
the
effect
of
the
Industrial
Revolution
on
the
rural
industries
of
East
Anglia
.
His
dissertation
was
nearly
finished
but
for
the
last
six
months
he
had
almost
stopped
work
on
it
and
had
devoted
himself
entirely
to
his
passion
,
a
crusade
against
nuclear
power
.
From
the
caravan
on
the
very
edge
of
the
sea
he
could
see
Larksoken
Power
Station
stark
against
the
skyline
,
as
uncompromising
as
his
own
will
to
oppose
it
,
a
symbol
and
a
threat
.
It
was
from
the
caravan
that
he
ran
People
Against
Nuclear
Power
,
with
its
acronym
PANUP
,
the
small
organization
of
which
he
was
both
founder
and
president
.
The
caravan
had
been
a
stroke
of
luck
.
The
owner
of
Cliff
Cottage
was
a
Canadian
who
,
returning
to
his
roots
and
seduced
by
nostalgia
,
had
bought
it
on
impulse
as
a
possible
holiday
home
.
About
fifty
years
earlier
there
had
been
a
murder
at
Cliff
Cottage
.
It
had
been
a
fairly
commonplace
murder
,
a
henpecked
husband
at
the
end
of
his
tether
who
had
taken
a
hatchet
to
his
virago
of
a
wife
.
But
if
it
had
been
neither
particularly
interesting
nor
mysterious
,
it
had
certainly
been
bloody
.
After
the
cottage
had
been
bought
the
Canadian
's
wife
had
heard
graphic
accounts
of
spilt
brains
and
blood-spattered
walls
and
had
declared
that
she
had
no
intention
of
living
there
in
summer
or
at
any
other
time
.
Its
very
isolation
,
once
attractive
,
now
appeared
both
sinister
and
repellent
.
And
to
compound
the
problem
,
the
local
planning
authority
had
shown
themselves
unsympathetic
to
the
owner
's
over-ambitious
plans
for
rebuilding
.
Disillusioned
with
the
cottage
and
its
problems
,
he
had
boarded
up
the
windows
and
returned
to
Toronto
,
meaning
eventually
to
come
back
and
make
a
final
decision
about
his
ill-advised
purchase
.
The
previous
owner
had
parked
a
large
,
old-fashioned
caravan
at
the
back
and
the
Canadian
had
made
no
difficulty
about
letting
this
to
Neil
for
two
pounds
a
week
,
seeing
it
as
a
useful
way
of
having
someone
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
property
.
And
it
was
the
caravan
,
at
once
his
home
and
his
office
,
from
which
Neil
conducted
his
campaign
.
He
tried
not
to
think
about
the
time
,
six
months
ahead
,
when
his
grant
would
finish
and
he
would
need
to
find
work
.
He
knew
that
he
had
somehow
to
stay
here
on
the
headland
,
to
keep
always
in
view
that
monstrous
building
which
dominated
his
imagination
as
it
did
his
view
.
But
now
,
to
the
uncertainty
about
his
future
funding
,
was
added
a
new
and
more
terrifying
threat
.
About
five
months
earlier
he
had
attended
an
open
day
at
the
power
station
during
which
the
Acting
Administrative
Officer
,
Hilary
Robarts
,
had
given
a
short
preliminary
talk
.
He
had
challenged
almost
everything
she
had
said
and
what
was
meant
as
an
informative
introduction
to
a
public
relations
exercise
had
developed
into
something
close
to
a
public
brawl
.
In
the
next
issue
of
his
news-sheet
he
had
reported
on
the
incident
in
terms
which
he
now
realized
had
been
unwise
.
She
had
sued
him
for
libel
.
The
action
was
due
to
be
heard
in
four
weeks
,
time
and
he
knew
that
,
successful
or
not
,
he
was
faced
with
ruin
.
Unless
she
died
in
the
next
few
weeks
-
and
why
should
she
die
?
-
it
could
be
the
end
of
his
life
on
the
headland
,
the
end
of
his
organization
,
the
end
of
all
he
had
planned
and
hoped
to
do
.
Amy
was
typing
envelopes
,
sending
out
the
final
copies
of
the
newsletter
.
A
pile
was
already
to
hand
and
he
began
folding
the
pamphlets
and
inserting
them
into
the
envelopes
.
The
job
was
n't
easy
.
He
had
tried
to
economize
with
the
size
and
quality
and
the
envelopes
were
in
danger
of
splitting
.
He
now
had
a
mailing
list
of
250
,
only
a
small
minority
of
whom
were
active
supporters
of
PANUP
.
Most
never
paid
any
dues
towards
the
organization
and
the
majority
of
the
pamphlets
went
unsolicited
to
public
authorities
,
local
firms
and
industry
in
the
vicinity
of
Larksoken
and
Sizewell
.
He
wondered
how
many
of
the
250
were
read
and
thought
,
with
a
sudden
spasm
of
anxiety
and
depression
,
of
the
total
cost
of
even
this
small
enterprise
.
And
this
month
's
newsletter
was
n't
his
best
.
Rereading
one
before
he
put
it
in
the
envelope
,
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
ill-organized
,
to
have
no
coherent
theme
.
The
principal
aim
now
was
to
refute
the
growing
argument
that
nuclear
power
could
avoid
the
damage
to
the
environment
through
the
greenhouse
effect
,
but
the
mixture
of
suggestions
ranging
from
solar
power
to
replacing
light
bulbs
with
those
which
consumed
seventy-five
per
cent
less
energy
seemed
naive
and
hardly
convincing
.
His
article
argued
that
nuclear-generated
electricity
could
n't
realistically
replace
oil
and
fossil
fuels
unless
all
nations
built
sixteen
new
reactors
a
week
in
the
five
years
from
1995
,
a
programme
impossible
to
achieve
and
one
which
,
if
practicable
,
would
add
intolerably
to
the
nuclear
threat
.
But
the
statistics
,
like
all
his
figures
,
were
culled
from
a
variety
of
sources
and
lacked
authority
.
Nothing
he
produced
seemed
to
him
genuinely
his
own
work
.
And
the
rest
of
the
newsletter
was
a
jumble
of
the
usual
scare
stories
,
most
of
which
he
had
used
before
;
allegations
of
safety
breaches
which
had
been
covered
up
,
doubts
about
the
safety
of
the
ageing
Magnox
stations
,
the
unsolved
problem
of
storing
and
transporting
nuclear
waste
.
And
this
issue
he
had
been
hard
put
to
it
to
find
a
couple
of
intelligent
letters
for
the
correspondence
page
;
sometimes
it
seemed
that
every
crackbrain
in
north-east
Norfolk
read
the
PANUP
newsletter
but
that
no
one
else
did
.
Amy
was
picking
at
the
letters
of
the
typewriter
which
had
a
persistent
tendency
to
stick
.
She
said
:
"
Neil
,
this
is
a
bloody
awful
machine
.
It
would
be
quicker
to
write
the
addresses
by
hand
.
"
"
It
's
better
since
you
cleaned
it
and
the
new
ribbon
looks
fine
.
"
"
It
's
still
diabolical
.
Why
do
n't
you
buy
a
new
one
?
It
would
save
time
in
the
end
.
"
"
I
ca
n't
afford
it
.
"
"
You
ca
n't
afford
a
new
typewriter
and
you
think
you
're
going
to
save
the
world
.
"
"
You
do
n't
need
possessions
to
save
the
world
,
Amy
.
Jesus
Christ
had
nothing
;
no
home
,
no
money
,
no
property
.
"
"
I
thought
you
said
when
I
came
here
that
you
were
n't
religious
.
"
It
always
surprised
him
that
,
apparently
taking
no
account
of
him
,
she
could
yet
recall
comments
he
had
made
months
earlier
.
He
said
:
"
I
do
n't
believe
Christ
was
God
.
I
do
n't
believe
there
is
a
God
.
But
I
believe
in
what
He
taught
.
"
"
If
He
was
n't
a
God
,
I
do
n't
see
that
it
matters
much
what
He
taught
.
Anyway
,
all
I
can
remember
is
something
about
turning
the
other
cheek
which
I
do
n't
believe
in
.
I
mean
,
that
's
daft
.
If
someone
slaps
your
left
cheek
then
you
slap
his
right
,
only
harder
.
Anyway
,
I
do
know
they
hung
Him
up
on
the
cross
so
it
did
n't
do
Him
a
lot
of
good
.
That
's
what
turning
the
other
cheek
does
for
you
.
"
He
said
:
"
I
've
got
a
Bible
here
somewhere
.
You
could
read
about
Him
if
you
wanted
to
.
Make
a
start
with
St
Mark
's
Gospel
.
"
"
No
thanks
.
I
had
enough
of
that
in
the
home
.
"
"
What
home
?
"
"
Just
a
home
,
before
the
baby
was
born
.
"
"
How
long
were
you
there
?
"
"
Two
weeks
.
Two
weeks
too
bloody
many
.
Then
I
ran
away
and
found
a
squat
.
"
"
Where
was
that
,
the
squat
?
"
"
Islington
,
Camden
,
King
's
Cross
,
Stoke
Newington
.
Does
it
matter
?
I
'm
here
now
,
OK
?
"
"
It
's
OK
by
me
,
Amy
.
"
Lost
in
his
thoughts
,
he
hardly
realized
that
he
had
given
up
folding
the
pamphlets
.
Amy
said
:
'Look
,
if
you
're
not
going
to
help
with
these
envelopes
you
might
as
well
go
and
put
a
new
washer
on
that
tap
.
It
's
been
dripping
for
weeks
and
Timmy
's
always
falling
about
in
the
mud
.
"
"
All
right
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
'll
do
it
now
.
"
He
took
down
his
tool
kit
from
the
high
cupboard
where
it
was
kept
well
out
of
Timmy
's
reach
.
He
was
glad
to
be
out
of
the
caravan
.
It
had
become
increasingly
claustrophobic
in
the
last
few
weeks
.
Outside
he
bent
to
talk
to
Timmy
,
caged
in
his
playpen
.
He
and
Amy
had
collected
large
stones
from
the
beach
,
looking
for
those
with
holes
in
them
-
and
he
had
strung
them
on
to
strong
cord
and
tied
them
along
one
side
of
the
playpen
.
Timmy
would
spend
hours
happily
banging
them
together
or
against
the
bars
or
,
as
now
,
slobbering
against
one
of
the
stones
in
an
attempt
to
get
it
into
his
mouth
.
Sometimes
he
would
communicate
with
individual
flints
,
a
continuous
admonitory
prattle
broken
by
sudden
triumphant
squeals
.
Kneeling
down
Neil
clutched
the
bars
,
rubbed
his
nose
against
Timmy
"
s
,
and
was
rewarded
by
his
huge
,
heart-tugging
smile
.
He
looked
very
like
his
mother
with
the
same
round
head
on
a
delicate
neck
,
the
same
beautifully
shaped
mouth
.
Only
his
eyes
,
widely
spaced
,
were
differently
shaped
,
large
blue
spheres
with
,
above
them
,
straight
bushy
eyebrows
which
reminded
Neil
of
pale
and
delicate
caterpillars
.
The
tenderness
he
felt
for
the
child
was
equal
to
,
if
different
from
,
the
tenderness
he
felt
for
his
mother
.
He
could
not
now
imagine
life
on
the
headland
without
either
of
them
.
But
the
tap
defeated
him
.
Despite
his
tuggings
with
the
wrench
he
could
n't
get
the
screw
to
shift
.
Even
this
minor
domestic
task
was
apparently
beyond
his
powers
.
He
could
hear
Amy
's
derisive
voice
.
"
You
want
to
change
the
world
and
you
ca
n't
change
a
washer
.
"
After
a
couple
of
minutes
he
gave
up
the
attempt
,
left
the
tool
box
by
the
cottage
wall
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
then
slithered
down
to
the
beach
.
Crunching
over
the
ridges
of
stones
,
he
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
almost
violently
wrenched
off
his
shoes
.
It
was
thus
,
when
the
weight
of
anxiety
about
his
failed
ambitions
,
his
uncertain
future
,
became
too
heavy
that
he
would
find
his
peace
,
standing
motionless
to
watch
the
veined
curve
of
the
poised
wave
,
the
tumult
of
crashing
foam
breaking
over
his
feet
,
the
wide
intersecting
arches
washing
over
the
smooth
sand
as
the
wave
retreated
to
leave
its
tenuous
lip
of
foam
.
But
today
even
this
wonder
,
continually
repeated
,
failed
to
comfort
his
spirit
.
He
gazed
out
to
the
horizon
with
unseeing
eyes
and
thought
about
his
present
life
,
the
hopelessness
of
the
future
,
about
Amy
,
about
his
family
.
Thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pocket
,
he
felt
the
crumpled
envelope
of
his
mother
's
last
letter
.
He
knew
that
his
parents
were
disappointed
in
him
,
although
they
never
said
so
openly
since
oblique
hints
were
just
as
effective
:
"
Mrs
Reilly
keeps
on
asking
me
,
what
is
Neil
doing
?
I
do
n't
like
to
say
that
you
're
living
in
a
caravan
with
no
proper
job
.
"
She
certainly
did
n't
like
to
say
that
he
was
living
there
with
a
girl
.
He
had
written
to
tell
them
about
Amy
since
his
parents
constantly
threatened
to
visit
and
"
unlikely
as
this
was
actually
to
happen
,
the
prospect
had
added
an
intolerable
anxiety
to
his
already
anxiety-ridden
life
.
"
I
'm
giving
a
temporary
home
to
an
unmarried
mother
in
return
for
typing
help
.
Do
n't
worry
,
I
sha
n't
suddenly
present
you
with
a
bastard
grandchild
.
"
After
the
letter
had
been
posted
.
he
had
felt
ashamed
.
The
cheap
attempt
at
humour
had
been
too
like
a
treacherous
repudiation
of
Timmy
whom
he
loved
.
And
his
mother
had
n't
found
it
either
funny
or
reassuring
.
His
letter
had
produced
an
almost
incoherent
farrago
of
warnings
,
pained
reproaches
and
veiled
references
to
the
possible
reaction
of
Mrs
Reilly
if
she
ever
got
to
know
.
Only
his
two
brothers
surreptitiously
welcomed
his
way
of
life
.
They
had
n't
made
university
and
the
difference
between
their
comfortable
life
style
-
houses
on
an
executive
estate
,
en
suite
bathrooms
,
artificial
coal
fires
in
what
they
called
the
lounge
,
working
wives
,
a
new
car
every
two
years
and
timeshares
in
Majorca
-
provided
both
with
agreeable
hours
of
self-satisfied
comparisons
which
he
knew
would
always
end
with
the
same
conclusion
,
that
he
ought
to
pull
himself
together
,
that
it
was
n't
right
,
not
after
all
the
sacrifices
Mum
and
Dad
had
made
to
send
him
to
college
,
and
a
fine
waste
of
money
that
had
proved
.
He
had
told
Amy
none
of
this
but
would
have
happily
confided
had
she
shown
the
least
interest
.
But
she
asked
no
questions
about
his
past
life
and
told
him
nothing
about
hers
.
Her
voice
,
her
body
,
her
smell
were
as
familiar
to
him
as
his
own
,
but
essentially
he
knew
no
more
about
her
now
than
when
she
had
arrived
.
She
refused
to
collect
any
welfare
benefits
,
saying
that
she
was
n't
going
to
have
DHSS
snoopers
visiting
the
caravan
to
see
if
she
and
Neil
were
sleeping
together
.
He
sympathized
.
He
did
n't
want
them
either
,
but
he
felt
that
for
Timmy
's
sake
she
should
take
what
was
on
offer
.
He
had
given
her
no
money
but
he
did
feed
both
of
them
,
and
this
was
difficult
enough
on
his
grant
.
No
one
visited
her
and
no
one
telephoned
.
Occasionally
she
would
receive
a
postcard
,
coloured
views
usually
of
London
with
nondescript
,
meaningless
messages
,
but
as
far
as
he
knew
she
never
replied
.
They
had
so
little
in
common
.
She
helped
spasmodically
with
PANUP
but
he
was
never
sure
how
far
she
was
actually
committed
.
And
he
knew
that
she
found
his
pacifism
stupid
.
He
could
recall
a
conversation
only
this
morning
.
"
Look
,
if
I
live
next
door
to
an
enemy
and
he
has
a
knife
,
a
gun
and
a
machine
gun
and
I
've
got
the
same
,
I
'm
not
going
to
chuck
mine
before
he
chucks
his
.
I
'll
say
,
OK
,
let
the
knife
go
,
then
the
gun
maybe
,
then
the
machine
gun
.
Him
and
me
at
the
same
time
.
Why
should
I
throw
mine
away
and
leave
him
with
his
?
"
"
But
one
of
you
has
to
make
a
start
,
Amy
.
There
has
to
be
a
beginning
of
trust
.
Whether
it
's
people
or
nations
,
we
have
to
find
the
faith
to
open
our
hearts
and
hands
and
say
,
"
Look
,
I
've
nothing
.
I
've
only
my
humanity
.
We
inhabit
the
same
planet
.
The
world
is
full
of
pain
but
we
need
n't
add
to
it
.
There
has
to
be
an
end
of
fear
.
''
"
She
had
said
obstinately
:
"
I
do
n't
see
why
he
should
chuck
his
weapons
once
he
knows
I
've
got
nothing
.
"
"
Why
should
he
keep
them
?
He
's
got
nothing
to
fear
from
you
any
more
.
"
"
He
'd
keep
them
because
he
liked
the
feeling
of
having
them
and
because
he
might
like
to
use
them
some
day
.
He
'd
like
the
power
and
he
'd
like
knowing
he
had
me
where
he
wanted
me
.
Honestly
,
Neil
,
you
're
so
naive
sometimes
.
That
's
how
people
are
.
"
"
But
we
ca
n't
argue
like
that
any
more
,
Amy
.
We
are
n't
talking
about
knives
and
guns
and
machine
guns
.
We
're
talking
about
weapons
neither
of
us
could
use
without
destroying
ourselves
and
probably
our
whole
planet
.
But
it
's
good
of
you
to
help
with
PANUP
when
you
do
n't
sympathize
.
"
She
had
said
:
"
PANUP
's
different
.
And
I
sympathize
all
right
.
I
just
think
that
you
're
wasting
your
time
writing
letters
,
making
speeches
,
sending
out
all
those
pamphlets
.
It
wo
n't
do
any
good
.
You
've
got
to
fight
people
their
way
.
"
"
But
it
's
done
good
already
.
All
over
the
world
ordinary
people
are
marching
,
demonstrating
,
making
their
voices
heard
,
letting
the
people
in
power
know
that
what
they
want
is
a
peaceful
world
for
themselves
and
their
children
.
Ordinary
people
like
you
.
"
And
then
she
had
almost
shouted
at
him
:
"
I
'm
not
ordinary
!
Do
n't
you
call
me
ordinary
!
If
there
are
ordinary
people
,
I
'm
not
one
of
them
.
"
"
I
'm
sorry
,
Amy
.
I
did
n't
mean
it
like
that
.
"
"
Then
do
n't
say
it
.
"
The
only
cause
they
had
in
common
was
a
refusal
to
eat
meat
.
Soon
after
she
arrived
at
the
caravan
he
had
said
:
"
I
'm
vegetarian
but
I
do
n't
expect
you
to
be
,
or
Timmy
.
"
He
had
wondered
as
he
spoke
whether
Timmy
was
old
enough
to
eat
meat
.
He
had
added
:
"
You
can
buy
a
chop
occasionally
in
Norwich
if
you
feel
like
it
.
"
"
What
you
have
is
all
right
by
me
.
Animals
do
n't
eat
me
,
and
I
do
n't
eat
them
.
"
"
And
Timmy
?
"
"
Timmy
has
what
I
give
him
.
He
's
not
fussy
.
"
Nor
was
he
.
Neil
could
n't
imagine
a
more
accommodating
child
nor
,
for
most
of
the
time
,
a
more
contented
one
.
He
had
found
the
second-hand
playpen
advertised
on
a
newsagent
's
board
in
Norwich
and
had
brought
it
back
on
the
top
of
the
van
.
In
it
Timmy
would
crawl
for
hours
or
pull
himself
up
and
stand
precariously
balancing
,
his
napkin
invariably
falling
about
his
knees
.
When
thwarted
he
would
rage
,
shutting
his
eyes
tight
,
opening
his
mouth
and
holding
his
breath
before
letting
out
a
bellow
of
such
terrifying
power
that
Neil
half
expected
the
whole
of
Lydsett
to
come
running
to
see
which
of
them
was
tormenting
the
child
.
Amy
never
smacked
him
but
would
jerk
him
on
to
her
hip
and
dump
him
on
her
bed
saying
:
"
Bloody
awful
noise
.
"
"
Should
n't
you
stay
with
him
?
Holding
his
breath
like
that
,
he
could
kill
himself
.
"
"
You
daft
?
He
wo
n't
kill
himself
.
They
never
do
.
"
And
he
knew
now
that
he
wanted
her
,
wanted
her
when
it
was
obvious
that
she
did
n't
want
him
and
would
never
again
risk
rejection
.
On
the
second
night
at
the
caravan
she
had
slid
back
the
partition
between
his
bed
and
hers
and
had
walked
quietly
up
to
his
bed
and
had
stood
gravely
looking
down
at
him
.
She
had
been
completely
naked
.
He
had
said
:
"
Look
,
Amy
,
you
do
n't
have
to
pay
me
.
"
I
never
pay
for
anything
,
at
least
not
like
that
.
But
have
it
your
own
way
.
"
After
a
pause
she
had
said
:
"
You
gay
or
something
?
"
"
No
,
it
's
just
that
I
do
n't
like
casual
affairs
.
"
"
You
mean
you
do
n't
like
them
,
or
you
do
n't
think
you
ought
to
have
them
?
"
"
I
suppose
I
mean
that
I
do
n't
think
I
ought
to
have
them
.
"
"
You
religious
,
then
?
"
"
No
,
I
'm
not
religious
,
not
in
the
ordinary
way
.
It
's
just
that
I
think
sex
is
too
important
to
be
casual
about
.
You
see
,
if
we
slept
together
and
I
-
if
I
disappointed
you
-
we
might
quarrel
and
then
you
'd
walk
out
.
You
'd
feel
that
you
had
to
.
You
'd
leave
,
you
and
Timmy
.
"
"
So
what
,
I
walk
out
.
"
"
I
would
n't
want
you
to
do
that
,
not
because
of
anything
I
'd
done
.
"
"
Or
had
n't
done
.
OK
,
I
expect
you
're
right
.
"
Another
pause
,
and
then
she
had
added
:
"
You
'd
mind
then
,
if
I
walked
out
?
"
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
'd
mind
.
"
She
had
turned
away
.
"
I
always
do
walk
out
in
the
end
.
No
one
has
ever
minded
before
.
"
It
was
the
only
sexual
advance
she
had
ever
made
to
him
and
he
knew
it
would
be
the
last
.
Now
they
slept
with
Timmy
's
cot
wedged
between
the
partition
and
his
bed
.
Sometimes
in
the
night
,
wakeful
because
the
child
had
stirred
,
he
would
put
out
his
hands
and
clasp
the
bars
and
long
to
shake
this
frail
barrier
that
symbolized
the
unbridgeable
gulf
between
them
.
She
lay
there
,
sleek
and
curved
as
a
fish
or
a
gull
,
so
close
that
he
could
hear
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
breath
faintly
echoing
the
suspiration
of
the
sea
.
His
body
ached
for
her
and
he
would
press
his
face
into
the
lumpy
pillow
groaning
with
the
hopelessness
of
his
need
.
What
could
she
possibly
see
in
him
to
make
her
want
him
,
except
,
as
on
that
one
night
,
out
of
gratitude
,
pity
,
curiosity
or
boredom
?
He
hated
his
body
,
the
scrawny
legs
on
which
the
kneecaps
protruded
like
deformities
,
the
small
blinking
eyes
too
closely
set
,
the
sparse
beard
which
could
n't
disguise
the
weakness
of
the
mouth
and
chin
.
Sometimes
,
too
,
he
was
tormented
by
jealousy
.
Without
proof
,
he
had
convinced
himself
that
there
was
someone
else
.
She
would
say
that
she
wanted
to
walk
alone
on
the
headland
.
And
he
would
watch
her
go
with
the
certainty
that
she
was
meeting
a
lover
.
And
when
she
returned
he
would
imagine
that
he
could
see
the
glow
of
the
skin
,
the
satisfied
smile
of
remembered
happiness
,
could
almost
smell
that
she
had
been
making
love
.
He
had
already
heard
from
the
university
that
his
research
grant
would
not
be
extended
.
The
decision
was
n't
surprising
;
he
had
been
warned
to
expect
it
.
He
had
been
saving
as
much
as
possible
from
the
grant
in
the
hope
of
amassing
a
small
sum
which
would
tide
him
over
until
he
could
find
a
local
job
.
It
hardly
mattered
what
.
Anything
that
would
pay
enough
to
live
and
allow
him
to
remain
on
the
headland
to
carry
on
the
campaign
.
In
theory
he
supposed
he
could
organize
PANUP
from
anywhere
in
the
UK
,
but
he
knew
that
it
was
irrevocably
bound
to
Larksoken
headland
,
to
the
caravan
,
to
that
concrete
mass
five
miles
to
the
north
which
had
power
,
apparently
,
to
dominate
his
will
as
it
did
his
imagination
.
He
had
already
put
out
feelers
with
local
employers
but
they
had
n't
been
too
keen
on
employing
a
well-known
agitator
;
even
those
who
seemed
sympathetic
to
the
anti-nuclear
cause
did
n't
actually
have
work
on
offer
.
Perhaps
they
feared
that
too
many
of
his
energies
would
be
diverted
to
the
campaign
.
And
his
small
capital
was
draining
away
with
the
extra
expense
of
Amy
,
Timmy
and
even
the
cats
.
And
now
there
was
the
threat
of
this
libel
action
,
less
of
a
threat
than
a
certainty
.
When
,
ten
minutes
later
,
he
returned
to
the
caravan
Amy
,
too
,
had
given
up
working
.
She
was
lying
on
her
bed
,
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
,
Smudge
and
Whisky
curled
on
her
stomach
.
Looking
down
at
her
,
he
said
abruptly
:
"
If
the
Robarts
legal
action
goes
ahead
I
'll
need
money
.
We
're
not
going
to
be
able
to
go
on
as
we
are
.
We
've
got
to
make
plans
.
"
She
sat
up
smartly
and
stared
at
him
.
The
kittens
,
affronted
,
squealed
their
protest
and
fled
.
"
You
mean
we
might
have
to
leave
here
?
"
The
"
we
"
would
normally
have
lifted
his
heart
,
now
he
hardly
noticed
it
.
"
It
's
possible
.
"
"
But
why
?
I
mean
,
you
are
n't
going
to
find
anything
cheaper
than
the
caravan
.
Try
getting
a
single
room
for
two
pounds
a
week
.
We
're
bloody
lucky
to
have
this
place
.
"
"
But
there
's
no
work
here
,
Amy
.
If
I
have
huge
damages
to
pay
,
I
'll
have
to
get
a
job
.
That
means
London
.
"
"
What
sort
of
a
job
?
"
"
Any
sort
.
I
've
got
my
degree
.
"
"
Well
,
I
ca
n't
see
the
sense
of
leaving
here
,
even
if
there
is
n't
any
work
.
You
can
go
to
the
DHSS
.
Draw
the
dole
.
"
"
That
is
n't
going
to
pay
damages
.
"
"
Well
,
if
you
have
to
go
,
maybe
I
'll
stay
on
.
I
can
pay
the
rent
here
.
After
all
,
what
's
the
difference
to
the
owner
?
He
'll
get
his
two
quid
whoever
pays
it
.
"
"
You
could
n't
live
here
alone
.
"
"
Why
not
?
I
've
lived
in
worse
places
.
"
"
On
what
?
What
would
you
do
for
money
?
"
"
Well
,
with
you
gone
I
could
go
to
the
DHSS
,
could
n't
I
?
They
could
send
their
snoopers
round
and
it
would
n't
matter
.
They
would
n't
be
able
to
say
I
was
having
sex
with
you
then
,
not
if
you
were
n't
here
.
Anyway
,
I
've
got
a
bit
in
my
post
office
account
.
"
The
casual
cruelty
of
the
suggestion
struck
at
his
heart
.
He
heard
with
heavy
disgust
the
note
of
self-pity
which
he
was
unable
to
suppress
.
He
said
:
"
Is
that
what
you
really
want
,
Amy
,
for
me
not
to
be
here
?
"
"
Do
n't
be
daft
,
I
was
only
teasing
.
Honestly
Neil
,
you
should
see
yourself
.
Talk
about
misery
.
Anyway
,
it
might
not
happen
-
the
libel
action
,
I
mean
.
"
"
It
's
bound
to
happen
unless
she
withdraws
it
.
They
've
set
a
date
for
the
hearing
.
"
"
She
might
withdraw
it
,
or
else
she
might
die
.
She
might
drown
on
one
of
those
night
swims
she
takes
after
the
headlines
on
the
nine
o'clock
news
,
regular
as
clockwork
,
right
up
to
December
.
"
"
Who
told
you
that
?
How
do
you
know
that
she
swims
at
night
?
"
"
You
did
.
"
"
I
ca
n't
remember
telling
you
.
"
"
Then
someone
else
did
,
one
of
the
regulars
in
the
Local
Hero
,
maybe
.
I
mean
,
it
's
no
secret
,
is
it
?
"
He
said
:
"
She
wo
n't
drown
.
She
's
a
strong
swimmer
.
She
would
n't
take
foolish
risks
.
And
I
ca
n't
wish
her
dead
.
You
ca
n't
preach
love
and
practise
hatred
.
"
"
I
can
-
wish
her
dead
,
I
mean
.
Maybe
the
Whistler
will
get
her
.
Or
you
might
win
the
action
and
then
she
'll
have
to
pay
you
.
That
'd
be
a
laugh
.
"
"
That
's
not
very
likely
.
I
consulted
a
lawyer
at
the
Citizens
Advice
Bureau
when
I
was
in
Norwich
last
Friday
.
I
could
see
he
thought
it
was
serious
,
that
she
did
have
a
case
.
He
said
I
ought
to
get
myself
a
lawyer
.
"
"
Well
,
get
one
.
"
"
How
?
Lawyers
cost
money
.
"
"
Get
legal
aid
.
Put
a
note
in
the
newsletter
asking
for
contributions
.
"
"
I
ca
n't
do
that
.
It
's
difficult
enough
keeping
the
newsletter
going
,
what
with
the
cost
of
paper
and
postage
.
"
Amy
said
,
suddenly
serious
:
"
I
'll
think
of
something
.
There
's
still
four
weeks
to
go
.
Anything
can
happen
in
four
weeks
.
Stop
worrying
.
It
's
going
to
be
all
right
.
Look
,
Neil
,
I
promise
you
that
libel
action
will
never
come
to
court
.
"
And
illogically
,
he
was
,
for
the
moment
,
reassured
and
comforted
.
It
was
six
o'clock
and
at
Larksoken
Power
Station
,
the
weekly
interdepartmental
meeting
was
drawing
to
a
close
.
It
had
lasted
thirty
minutes
longer
than
usual
;
Dr
Alex
Mair
took
the
view
,
which
he
could
normally
enforce
by
brisk
chairmanship
,
that
little
original
thought
was
contributed
to
a
discussion
after
three
hours
of
talking
.
But
it
had
been
a
heavy
agenda
:
the
revised
safety
plan
still
in
draft
;
the
rationalization
of
the
internal
structure
from
the
present
seven
departments
to
three
under
engineering
,
production
and
resources
;
the
report
of
the
district
survey
laboratory
on
their
monitoring
of
the
environment
;
the
preliminary
agenda
for
the
local
liaison
committee
.
This
annual
jamboree
was
an
unwieldy
but
useful
public
relations
exercise
which
needed
careful
preparation
,
including
as
it
did
representatives
from
the
interested
government
departments
,
local
authorities
,
police
,
fire
and
water
authorities
,
the
National
Farmers
Union
and
the
Country
Landowners
'
Association
.
Mair
sometimes
grudged
the
work
and
time
it
involved
but
he
knew
its
importance
.
The
weekly
meeting
was
held
in
his
office
at
the
conference
table
set
in
front
of
the
south
window
.
Darkness
was
falling
and
the
huge
pane
of
glass
was
a
black
rectangle
in
which
he
could
see
their
faces
reflected
,
like
the
gaunt
,
disembodied
heads
of
night
travellers
in
a
lighted
railway
carriage
.
He
suspected
that
some
of
his
departmental
heads
,
particularly
BH
Morgan
,
the
Works
Office
Engineer
,
and
Stephen
Mansell
,
the
Maintenance
Superintendent
,
would
have
preferred
a
more
relaxed
setting
in
his
private
sitting
room
next
door
,
the
low
,
comfortable
chairs
,
a
few
hours
of
chat
with
no
set
agenda
,
perhaps
a
drink
together
afterwards
in
a
local
pub
.
Well
,
that
was
one
management
style
,
but
it
was
n't
his
.
Now
he
closed
the
stiff
cover
of
his
folder
in
which
his
PA
had
meticulously
tagged
all
the
papers
and
cross-references
,
and
said
dismissively
:
"
Any
other
business
.
"
But
he
was
not
allowed
to
get
away
so
easily
.
On
his
right
,
as
usual
,
sat
Miles
Lessingham
,
the
Operations
Superintendent
,
whose
reflection
,
staring
back
into
the
room
,
looked
like
a
hydrocephalic
death
's
head
.
Glancing
from
the
image
to
the
face
,
Mair
could
see
little
difference
.
The
stark
overhead
lights
threw
deep
shadows
under
the
deep-set
eyes
and
the
sweat
glistened
on
the
wide
,
rather
knobbly
forehead
with
its
swathe
of
fair
undisciplined
hair
.
Now
he
stretched
back
in
his
chair
and
said
:
"
This
proposed
job
-
rumoured
job
,
I
should
say
-
I
suppose
we
're
entitled
to
ask
whether
it
has
been
formally
offered
to
you
yet
?
Or
are
n't
we
?
"
Mair
said
calmly
:
The
answer
is
that
it
has
n't
;
the
publicity
was
premature
.
The
press
got
hold
of
it
somehow
,
as
they
usually
do
,
but
there
's
nothing
official
yet
.
One
unfortunate
result
of
our
present
habit
of
leaking
any
information
of
interest
is
that
the
people
most
concerned
become
the
last
to
know
.
If
and
when
it
is
official
you
seven
will
be
the
first
to
be
told
.
"
Lessingham
said
:
"
It
will
have
serious
implications
here
,
Alex
,
if
you
do
go
.
The
contract
already
signed
for
the
new
PWR
reactor
,
the
internal
reorganization
which
is
bound
to
create
disruption
,
electricity
privatization
.
It
's
a
bad
time
for
a
change
at
the
top
.
"
Maid
said
:
"
Is
there
ever
a
good
time
?
But
until
it
happens
,
if
it
does
happen
,
there
's
little
point
in
discussing
it
.
"
John
Standing
,
the
station
chemist
,
said
:
"
But
the
internal
reorganization
will
go
ahead
presumably
?
"
"
I
hope
so
,
considering
the
time
and
energy
we
've
spent
planning
it
.
I
should
be
surprised
if
a
change
at
the
top
alters
a
necessary
reorganization
which
is
already
under
way
.
"
Lessingham
asked
:
"
Who
will
they
appoint
,
a
director
or
a
station
manager
?
"
The
question
was
less
innocent
than
it
sounded
.
"
I
imagine
a
station
manager
.
"
"
You
mean
that
the
research
will
go
?
"
Mair
said
:
"
When
I
go
,
now
or
later
,
the
research
will
go
.
You
've
always
known
that
.
I
brought
it
with
me
and
I
would
n't
have
taken
the
job
if
I
could
n't
have
continued
it
here
.
I
asked
for
certain
research
facilities
and
I
got
them
.
But
research
at
Larksoken
has
always
been
somewhat
of
an
anomaly
.
We
've
done
good
work
,
are
still
doing
good
work
,
but
logically
it
should
be
done
elsewhere
,
at
Harwell
or
Winfrith
.
Is
there
any
other
business
?
"
But
Lessingham
was
not
to
be
discouraged
.
He
said
:
"
Who
will
you
be
responsible
to
?
The
Secretary
of
State
for
Energy
directly
or
the
AEA
?
"
Mair
knew
the
answer
but
had
no
intention
of
giving
it
.
He
said
quietly
:
"
That
is
still
under
discussion
.
"
"
Along
,
no
doubt
,
with
such
minor
matters
as
pay
,
rations
,
scope
of
your
responsibilities
and
what
you
are
going
to
be
called
.
Controller
of
Nuclear
Power
has
a
certain
cachet
.
I
like
it
.
But
what
precisely
will
you
control
?
"
There
was
a
silence
.
Mair
said
:
"
If
the
answer
to
that
question
were
known
,
no
doubt
the
appointment
would
have
been
made
by
now
.
I
do
n't
want
to
stifle
discussion
,
but
had
n't
we
better
confine
it
to
matters
within
the
competence
of
this
committee
?
Right
,
is
there
any
other
business
?
"
and
this
time
there
was
no
reply
.
Hilary
Robarts
,
the
Acting
Administrative
Officer
,
had
already
closed
her
file
.
She
had
n't
taken
part
in
the
questioning
but
the
others
,
Mair
knew
,
would
assume
that
that
was
because
he
had
already
told
her
the
answers
.
Even
before
they
had
left
,
his
PA
,
Caroline
Amphlett
,
had
come
in
to
take
away
the
tea
cups
and
clear
the
table
.
Lessingham
made
it
a
habit
to
leave
his
agenda
behind
,
a
small
personal
protest
against
the
amount
of
paper
which
the
formal
weekly
meeting
generated
.
Dr
Martin
Goss
,
head
of
the
medical
physics
department
,
had
,
as
always
,
doodled
obsessively
.
His
jotting
pad
was
covered
with
hot-air
balloons
,
intricately
patterned
and
decorated
;
part
of
his
mind
had
obviously
been
with
his
private
passion
.
Caroline
Amphlett
moved
,
as
always
,
with
a
quiet
,
efficient
grace
.
Neither
spoke
.
She
had
worked
for
Mair
as
his
PA
for
the
last
three
years
and
he
knew
her
now
no
better
than
on
that
morning
when
she
had
sat
in
this
same
office
being
interviewed
for
the
job
.
She
was
a
tall
,
blonde
girl
,
smooth-skinned
with
wide-spaced
,
rather
small
eyes
of
an
extraordinary
deep
blue
,
who
would
have
been
thought
beautiful
if
she
had
shown
more
animation
.
Mair
suspected
that
she
used
her
confidential
job
as
his
PA
to
preserve
a
deliberately
intimidating
reserve
.
She
was
the
most
efficient
secretary
he
had
ever
had
and
it
irked
him
that
she
had
made
it
clear
that
,
if
and
when
he
moved
,
she
would
wish
to
stay
at
Larksoken
.
She
had
told
him
that
her
reasons
were
personal
.
That
,
of
course
,
meant
Jonathan
Reeves
,
a
junior
engineer
in
the
workshop
.
He
had
been
as
surprised
and
chagrined
at
her
choice
as
he
had
at
the
prospect
of
taking
up
a
new
job
with
an
unknown
PA
,
but
there
had
been
an
additional
and
more
disturbing
reaction
.
Hers
was
not
a
type
of
female
beauty
which
attracted
him
and
he
had
always
assumed
that
she
was
physically
cold
.
It
was
disconcerting
to
think
that
an
acned
nonenity
had
discovered
and
perhaps
explored
depths
which
he
,
in
their
daily
intimacy
,
had
n't
even
suspected
.
He
had
sometimes
wondered
,
although
with
little
real
curiosity
,
whether
she
might
not
be
less
compliant
,
more
complicated
than
he
had
supposed
,
had
occasionally
had
a
disconcerting
sense
that
the
facade
she
presented
to
the
power
station
of
dedicated
,
humourless
efficiency
had
been
carefully
constructed
to
conceal
a
less
accommodating
,
more
complex
personality
.
But
if
the
real
Caroline
was
accessible
to
Jonathan
Reeves
,
if
she
really
liked
and
wanted
that
unprepossessing
wimp
,
then
she
hardly
merited
the
tribute
even
of
his
curiosity
.
He
gave
his
departmental
heads
time
to
get
back
to
their
offices
before
he
rang
for
Hilary
Robarts
and
asked
her
to
come
back
.
It
would
have
been
more
usual
to
have
asked
her
with
careful
casualness
to
wait
behind
after
the
meeting
but
what
he
had
to
say
was
private
and
he
had
been
trying
for
some
weeks
now
to
cut
down
the
number
of
times
when
they
were
known
to
be
alone
together
.
He
was
n't
looking
forward
to
the
interview
.
She
would
see
what
he
had
to
say
as
personal
criticism
and
that
was
something
which
in
his
experience
few
women
could
take
.
He
thought
:
She
was
my
mistress
once
.
I
was
in
love
with
her
,
as
much
in
love
as
I
thought
I
was
capable
of
being
.
And
if
it
was
n't
love
,
whatever
that
word
means
,
at
least
I
wanted
her
.
Will
that
make
what
I
have
to
say
easier
or
more
difficult
?
He
told
himself
that
all
men
were
cowards
when
it
came
to
a
showdown
with
a
woman
.
That
first
post-natal
subservience
,
bred
of
physical
dependence
,
was
too
ingrained
ever
to
be
totally
eradicated
.
He
was
n't
more
cowardly
than
the
rest
of
his
sex
.
What
was
it
he
had
overheard
that
woman
in
the
Lydsett
stores
saying
?
"
George
would
do
anything
to
avoid
a
scene
.
"
Of
course
he
would
,
poor
sod
.
Women
with
their
womb-smelling
warmth
,
their
talcum
powder
and
milky
breasts
had
seen
to
that
in
the
first
four
weeks
of
life
.
He
stood
up
when
she
came
in
and
waited
until
she
had
taken
the
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
.
Then
he
opened
the
right-hand
drawer
and
took
out
a
duplicated
news-sheet
which
he
slid
across
the
desk
towards
her
.
"
Have
you
seen
this
?
It
's
Neil
Pascoe
's
latest
news-sheet
from
PANUP
.
"
She
said
:
"
People
Against
Nuclear
Power
.
That
means
Pascoe
and
a
few
dozen
other
ill-informed
hysterics
.
Of
course
I
've
seen
it
,
I
'm
on
his
mailing
list
.
He
takes
good
care
that
I
see
it
.
"
She
gave
it
a
brief
glance
,
then
pushed
it
back
across
the
desk
.
He
took
it
up
and
read
:
"
Many
readers
will
probably
have
learned
by
now
that
I
am
being
sued
by
Miss
Hilary
Robarts
,
the
Acting
Administrative
Officer
at
Larksoken
Power
Station
,
for
alleged
libel
arising
from
what
I
wrote
in
the
May
issue
of
the
news-sheet
.
I
shall
,
of
course
,
strenuously
defend
the
action
and
,
as
I
have
no
money
to
pay
for
a
lawyer
,
will
present
my
own
defence
.
This
is
just
the
latest
example
of
the
threat
to
free
information
and
even
free
speech
presented
by
the
nuclear
energy
lobby
.
Apparently
now
even
the
mildest
criticism
is
to
be
followed
by
the
threat
of
legal
action
.
But
there
is
a
positive
side
.
This
action
by
Hilary
Robarts
shows
that
we
,
the
ordinary
people
of
this
county
,
are
making
our
impact
.
Would
they
bother
with
our
small
news-sheet
if
they
were
n't
running
scared
?
And
the
libel
action
,
if
it
comes
to
trial
,
will
give
us
valuable
national
publicity
if
properly
handled
.
We
are
stronger
than
we
know
.
Meanwhile
I
give
below
the
dates
of
the
next
open
days
at
Larksoken
so
that
as
many
of
us
as
possible
can
attend
and
strenuously
put
our
case
against
nuclear
power
during
the
question
time
which
normally
precedes
the
actual
tour
of
the
station
.
"
She
said
:
"
I
told
you
,
I
've
seen
it
.
I
do
n't
know
why
you
wasted
your
time
reading
it
out
.
He
seems
determined
to
aggravate
his
offence
.
If
he
had
any
sense
he
'd
get
himself
a
good
lawyer
and
keep
his
mouth
shut
.
"
"
He
ca
n't
afford
a
lawyer
.
And
he
wo
n't
be
able
to
pay
damages
.
"
He
paused
,
and
then
said
quietly
:
"
In
the
interests
of
the
station
I
think
you
should
drop
it
.
"
"
Is
that
an
order
?
"
"
I
've
no
power
to
compel
you
and
you
know
that
.
I
'm
asking
you
.
You
'll
get
nothing
out
of
him
,
the
man
's
practically
penniless
,
and
he
is
n't
worth
the
trouble
.
"
"
He
is
to
me
.
What
he
describes
as
mild
criticism
was
a
serious
libel
and
it
was
widely
disseminated
.
There
's
no
defence
.
Remember
the
actual
words
?
"
A
woman
whose
response
to
Chernobyl
is
that
only
thirty-one
people
were
killed
,
who
can
dismiss
as
unimportant
one
of
the
world
's
greatest
nuclear
disasters
which
put
thousands
in
hospital
,
exposed
a
hundred
thousand
or
more
to
dangerous
radioactivity
,
devastated
vast
areas
of
land
,
and
may
result
in
deaths
from
cancer
amounting
to
fifty
thousand
over
the
next
fifty
years
,
is
totally
unsuitable
to
be
trusted
to
work
in
an
atomic
power
station
.
While
she
remains
there
,
in
any
capacity
,
we
must
have
the
gravest
doubts
whether
safety
will
ever
be
taken
seriously
at
Larksoken
.
'
"
That
's
a
clear
allegation
of
professional
incompetence
.
If
he
's
allowed
to
get
away
with
that
,
we
'll
never
get
rid
of
him
.
"
"
I
was
n't
aware
that
we
were
in
the
business
of
getting
rid
of
inconvenient
critics
.
What
method
had
you
in
mind
?
"
He
paused
,
detecting
in
his
voice
the
first
trace
of
that
reedy
mixture
of
sarcasm
and
pomposity
which
he
knew
occasionally
affected
him
and
to
which
he
was
morbidly
sensitive
.
He
went
on
:
"
He
's
a
free
citizen
living
where
he
chooses
.
He
's
entitled
to
his
views
.
Hilary
,
he
's
not
a
worthy
opponent
.
Bring
him
to
court
and
he
'll
attract
publicity
for
his
cause
and
do
your
own
no
good
at
all
.
We
're
trying
to
win
over
the
locals
,
not
antagonize
them
.
Let
it
go
before
someone
starts
a
fund
to
pay
for
his
defence
.
One
martyr
on
Larksoken
headland
is
enough
.
"
While
he
was
speaking
she
got
up
and
began
pacing
to
and
fro
across
the
wide
office
.
Then
she
paused
and
turned
to
him
.
"
This
is
what
it
's
all
about
,
is
n't
it
?
The
reputation
of
the
station
,
your
reputation
.
What
about
my
reputation
?
If
I
drop
the
action
now
it
will
be
a
clear
admission
that
he
was
right
,
that
I
'm
not
fit
to
work
here
.
"
"
What
he
wrote
has
n't
hurt
your
reputation
with
anyone
who
matters
.
And
suing
him
is
n't
going
to
help
it
.
It
's
unwise
to
let
policy
be
influenced
,
let
alone
jeopardized
,
by
outraged
personal
pride
.
The
reasonable
course
is
quietly
to
drop
the
action
.
What
do
feelings
matter
?
"
He
found
that
he
could
n't
remain
seated
while
she
was
striding
to
and
fro
across
the
office
.
He
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
over
to
the
window
hearing
the
angry
voice
but
no
longer
having
to
face
her
,
watching
the
reflection
of
her
pacing
figure
,
the
swirling
hair
.
He
said
again
:
"
What
do
feelings
matter
?
It
's
the
work
that
is
important
.
"
"
They
matter
to
me
.
And
that
's
something
you
've
never
understood
,
have
you
?
Life
is
about
feeling
.
Loving
is
about
feeling
.
It
was
the
same
with
the
abortion
.
You
forced
me
to
have
it
.
Did
you
ever
ask
yourself
what
I
felt
then
,
what
I
needed
?
"
Oh
God
,
he
thought
,
not
this
,
not
again
,
not
now
.
He
said
,
still
with
his
back
to
her
:
"
It
's
ridiculous
to
say
that
I
forced
you
.
How
could
I
?
And
I
thought
you
felt
as
I
did
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
you
to
have
a
child
.
"
"
Oh
no
,
it
was
n't
.
If
you
're
so
bloody
keen
on
accuracy
,
let's
be
accurate
about
this
.
It
would
have
been
inconvenient
,
embarrassing
,
awkward
,
expensive
.
But
it
was
n't
impossible
.
It
still
is
n't
impossible
.
And
,
for
God
's
sake
,
turn
around
.
Look
at
me
.
I
'm
talking
to
you
.
What
I
'm
saying
is
important
.
"
He
turned
and
walked
back
to
the
desk
.
He
said
calmly
:
"
All
right
,
my
phrasing
was
inaccurate
.
Have
a
child
by
all
means
if
that
's
what
you
want
.
I
'll
be
happy
for
you
as
long
as
you
do
n't
expect
me
to
father
it
.
But
what
we
're
talking
about
now
is
Neil
Pascoe
and
PANUP
.
We
've
gone
to
a
lot
of
trouble
here
to
promote
good
relations
with
the
local
community
and
I
'm
not
going
to
have
all
that
good
work
vitiated
by
a
totally
unnecessary
legal
action
,
particularly
not
now
when
work
will
soon
begin
on
the
new
reactor
.
"
Then
try
to
prevent
it
.
And
since
we
're
talking
about
public
relations
,
I
'm
surprised
you
have
n't
mentioned
Ryan
Blaney
and
Scudder
's
Cottage
.
My
cottage
,
in
case
you
've
forgotten
.
What
am
I
expected
to
do
about
that
?
Hand
over
my
property
to
him
and
his
kids
rent-free
in
the
interests
of
good
public
relations
?
"
"
That
's
a
different
matter
.
It
's
not
my
concern
as
Director
.
But
if
you
want
my
opinion
,
I
think
you
're
ill-advised
to
try
and
force
him
out
simply
because
you
've
got
a
legal
case
.
He
's
paying
the
rent
regularly
,
is
n't
he
?
And
it
is
n't
as
if
you
want
the
cottage
.
"
"
I
do
want
the
cottage
.
It
's
mine
.
I
bought
it
and
now
I
want
to
sell
it
.
"
She
slumped
back
into
the
chair
and
he
,
too
,
sat
.
He
made
himself
stare
into
the
eyes
in
which
,
to
his
discomfort
,
he
saw
more
pain
than
anger
.
He
said
:
"
Presumably
he
knows
that
and
he
'll
get
out
when
he
can
,
but
it
wo
n't
be
easy
.
He
's
recently
widowed
and
he
's
got
four
children
.
There
's
a
certain
amount
of
local
feeling
about
it
,
I
understand
.
"
"
I
've
no
doubt
there
is
,
particularly
in
the
Local
Hero
where
Ryan
Blaney
spends
most
of
his
time
and
money
.
I
'm
not
prepared
to
wait
.
If
we
're
moving
to
London
in
the
next
three
months
there
's
not
much
time
to
get
the
question
of
the
cottage
settled
.
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
that
kind
of
unfinished
business
.
I
want
to
get
it
on
the
market
as
soon
as
possible
.
"
He
knew
that
this
was
the
moment
when
he
should
have
said
firmly
:
"
I
may
be
moving
to
London
,
but
not
with
you
.
"
But
he
found
it
impossible
.
He
told
himself
that
it
was
late
,
the
end
of
a
busy
day
,
the
worst
possible
time
for
rational
argument
.
She
was
already
overwrought
.
One
thing
at
a
time
.
He
had
tackled
her
about
Pascoe
and
,
although
she
had
reacted
much
as
he
'd
expected
,
perhaps
she
would
think
it
over
and
do
what
he
advised
.
And
she
was
right
about
Ryan
Blaney
;
it
was
none
of
his
business
.
The
interview
had
left
him
with
two
clear
intentions
more
firmly
fixed
than
ever
in
his
mind
.
She
was
n't
coming
to
London
with
him
and
nor
would
he
recommend
her
as
Administrative
Officer
at
Larksoken
.
For
all
her
efficiency
,
her
intelligence
,
her
appropriate
education
,
she
was
n't
the
right
person
for
the
job
.
For
a
moment
it
crossed
his
mind
that
here
was
his
bargaining
card
.
"
I
'm
not
offering
you
marriage
but
I
am
offering
you
the
most
senior
job
you
could
possibly
aspire
to
.
"
But
he
knew
there
was
no
real
temptation
.
He
would
n't
leave
the
administration
of
Larksoken
in
her
hands
.
Sooner
or
later
she
was
going
to
have
to
realize
that
there
would
be
no
marriage
and
no
promotion
.
But
now
was
the
wrong
moment
and
he
found
himself
wondering
wryly
when
the
right
moment
might
be
.
Instead
he
said
:
"
Look
,
we
're
here
to
run
a
power
station
efficiently
and
safely
.
We
're
doing
a
necessary
and
important
job
.
Of
course
we
're
committed
to
it
,
we
would
n't
be
here
otherwise
.
But
we
're
scientists
and
technicians
,
not
evangelists
.
We
're
not
running
a
religious
campaign
.
"
"
They
are
,
the
other
side
.
He
is
.
You
see
him
as
an
insignificant
twit
.
He
is
n't
.
He
's
dishonest
and
he
's
dangerous
.
Look
how
he
scrubs
around
in
the
records
to
turn
up
individual
cases
of
leukaemia
which
he
thinks
he
can
ascribe
to
nuclear
energy
.
And
now
he
's
got
the
latest
Comare
report
to
fuel
his
spurious
concern
.
And
what
about
last
month
's
newsletter
,
that
emotive
nonsense
about
the
midnight
trains
of
death
trundling
silently
through
the
northern
suburbs
of
London
?
Anyone
would
think
they
were
carrying
open
trucks
of
radioactive
waste
.
Does
n't
he
care
that
nuclear
energy
has
so
far
saved
the
world
from
burning
five
hundred
million
tons
of
coal
?
Has
n't
he
heard
about
the
greenhouse
effect
?
I
mean
,
is
the
fool
totally
ignorant
?
Has
n't
he
any
conception
of
the
devastation
caused
to
this
planet
by
burning
fossil
fuels
?
Has
no
one
told
him
about
acid
rain
or
the
carcinogens
in
coal
waste
?
And
when
it
comes
to
danger
,
what
about
the
fifty-seven
miners
buried
alive
in
the
Borken
disaster
only
this
year
?
Do
n't
their
lives
matter
?
Think
of
the
outcry
if
that
had
been
a
nuclear
accident
.
"
He
said
:
"
He
's
only
one
voice
and
a
pathetically
uneducated
and
ignorant
one
.
"
"
But
he
's
having
his
effect
and
you
know
it
.
We
've
got
to
match
passion
with
passion
.
"
His
mind
fastened
on
the
word
.
We
're
not
,
he
thought
,
talking
about
nuclear
energy
,
we
're
talking
about
Passion
.
Would
we
be
having
this
conversation
if
we
were
still
lovers
?
She
's
demanding
from
me
a
commitment
to
something
more
personal
than
atomic
Power
.
Turning
to
face
her
,
he
was
visited
suddenly
,
not
by
desire
,
but
by
a
memory
,
inconveniently
intense
,
of
the
desire
he
had
once
felt
for
her
.
And
with
memory
came
a
sudden
vivid
picture
of
them
together
in
her
cottage
,
the
heavy
breasts
bent
over
him
,
her
hair
falling
across
his
face
,
her
lips
,
her
hands
,
her
thighs
.
He
said
roughly
:
"
If
you
want
a
religion
,
if
you
need
a
religion
,
then
find
one
.
There
are
plenty
to
choose
from
.
All
right
the
abbey
is
in
ruins
and
I
doubt
whether
that
impotent
old
priest
up
at
the
Old
Rectory
has
much
on
offer
.
But
find
something
or
someone
;
give
up
fish
on
Friday
,
do
n't
eat
meat
,
count
beads
,
put
ashes
on
your
head
,
meditate
four
times
a
day
,
bow
down
towards
your
own
personal
Mecca
.
But
do
n't
,
for
God
's
sake
,
assuming
He
exists
,
ever
make
science
into
a
religion
.
"
The
telephone
on
his
desk
rang
.
Caroline
Amphlett
had
left
and
it
was
switched
through
to
an
outside
line
.
As
he
lifted
the
receiver
he
saw
that
Hilary
was
standing
at
the
door
.
She
gave
him
a
last
long
look
and
went
out
,
shutting
it
with
unnecessary
firmness
behind
her
.
The
caller
was
his
sister
.
She
said
:
"
I
hoped
I
'd
catch
you
.
I
forgot
to
remind
you
to
call
at
Bollard
's
farm
for
the
ducks
for
Thursday
.
He
'll
have
them
ready
.
We
'll
be
six
,
incidentally
.
I
've
invited
Adam
Dalgliesh
.
He
's
back
on
the
headland
.
"
He
was
able
to
answer
her
as
calmly
as
she
had
spoken
.
"
Congratulations
.
He
and
his
aunt
have
contrived
with
some
skill
to
avoid
their
neighbours
"
cutlets
for
the
last
five
years
.
How
did
you
manage
it
?
"
"
By
the
expedient
of
asking
.
I
imagine
he
may
be
thinking
of
keeping
on
the
mill
as
a
holiday
home
and
feels
it
's
time
to
acknowledge
that
he
does
have
neighbours
.
Or
he
may
be
planning
to
sell
,
in
which
case
he
can
risk
a
dinner
party
without
being
trapped
into
intimacy
.
But
why
not
give
him
credit
for
a
simple
human
weakness
;
the
attraction
of
eating
a
good
dinner
which
he
has
n't
had
to
cook
?
"
And
it
would
balance
her
table
,
thought
Mair
,
although
that
was
hardly
likely
to
have
been
a
consideration
.
She
despised
the
Noah
's
Ark
convention
which
decreed
that
a
superfluous
man
,
however
unattractive
or
stupid
,
was
acceptable
;
a
superfluous
woman
,
however
witty
and
well-informed
,
a
social
embarrassment
.
He
said
:
"
Am
I
expected
to
talk
about
his
poetry
?
"
"
I
imagine
he
's
come
to
Larksoken
to
get
away
from
people
who
want
to
talk
about
his
poetry
.
But
it
would
n't
hurt
you
to
take
a
look
at
it
.
I
've
got
the
most
recent
volume
.
And
it
is
poetry
,
not
prose
rearranged
on
the
page
.
"
"
With
modern
verse
,
can
one
tell
the
difference
?
"
"
Oh
yes
,
"
she
said
.
"
If
it
can
be
read
as
prose
,
then
it
is
prose
.
It
's
an
infallible
test
.
"
"
But
not
one
,
I
imagine
,
that
the
English
faculties
would
support
.
I
'll
be
leaving
in
ten
minutes
.
I
wo
n't
forget
the
ducks
.
"
He
smiled
as
he
replaced
the
receiver
.
His
sister
invariably
had
the
power
to
restore
him
to
good
humour
.
Before
leaving
he
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
door
and
let
his
eyes
range
round
the
room
as
if
he
were
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
.
He
was
ambitious
for
the
new
job
,
had
cleverly
planned
and
schemed
to
get
it
.
And
now
,
when
it
was
almost
his
,
he
realized
how
much
he
would
miss
Larksoken
,
its
remoteness
,
its
bleak
uncompromising
strength
.
Nothing
had
been
done
to
prettify
the
site
as
at
Sizewell
,
on
the
Suffolk
coast
,
or
to
produce
the
pleasantly
laid-out
grounds
of
smooth
lawn
,
flowering
trees
and
shrubs
which
so
agreeably
impressed
him
on
his
periodic
visits
to
Winfrith
in
Dorset
.
A
low
,
curving
wall
faced
with
flint
had
been
built
on
the
seaward
boundary
behind
whose
shelter
every
spring
a
bright
ribbon
of
daffodils
strained
and
tossed
in
the
March
winds
.
Little
else
had
been
done
to
harmonize
or
soften
the
concrete
's
grey
immensity
.
But
this
was
what
he
liked
,
the
wide
expanse
of
turbulent
sea
,
browny-grey
,
white-laced
under
a
limitless
sky
,
windows
which
he
could
open
so
that
,
at
a
touch
of
his
hand
,
the
faint
continuous
boom
like
distant
thunder
would
instantaneously
pour
into
his
office
in
a
roar
of
crashing
billows
.
He
liked
best
the
stormy
winter
evenings
when
,
working
late
,
he
could
see
the
lights
of
shipping
prinking
the
horizon
as
they
made
their
way
down
the
coast
to
the
Yarmouth
lanes
,
and
see
the
flashing
lightships
and
the
beam
from
Happisburgh
Lighthouse
,
which
for
generations
had
warned
mariners
of
the
treacherous
offshore
sands
.
Even
on
the
darkest
night
,
by
the
light
which
the
sea
seemed
mysteriously
to
absorb
and
reflect
,
he
could
make
out
the
splendid
fifteenth-century
west
tower
of
Happisburgh
Church
,
that
embattled
symbol
of
man
's
precarious
defences
against
this
most
dangerous
of
seas
.
And
it
was
a
symbol
of
more
than
that
.
The
tower
must
have
been
the
last
sight
of
land
for
hundreds
of
drowning
mariners
in
peace
and
war
.
His
mind
,
always
tenacious
of
facts
,
could
recall
the
details
at
will
.
The
crew
of
HMS
Peggy
,
driven
ashore
on
19
December
1770
,
the
119
members
of
HMS
Invincible
wrecked
on
the
sands
on
13
March
1801
when
on
her
way
to
join
Nelson
's
fleet
at
Copenhagen
,
the
crew
of
HMS
Hunter
,
the
revenue
cutter
,
lost
in
1804
,
many
of
their
crews
buried
under
the
grassy
mounds
in
Happisburgh
Churchyard
.
Built
in
an
age
of
faith
,
the
tower
had
stood
as
a
symbol
,
too
,
of
that
final
unquenchable
hope
that
even
the
sea
would
yield
up
her
dead
and
that
their
God
was
God
of
the
waters
as
he
was
of
the
land
.
But
now
mariners
could
see
,
dwarfing
the
tower
,
the
huge
rectangular
bulk
of
Larksoken
Power
Station
.
For
those
who
sought
symbols
in
inanimate
objects
its
message
was
both
simple
and
expedient
,
that
man
,
by
his
own
intelligence
and
his
own
efforts
,
could
understand
and
master
his
world
,
could
make
his
transitory
life
more
agreeable
,
more
comfortable
,
more
free
of
pain
.
For
him
this
was
challenging
enough
,
and
if
he
had
needed
a
faith
to
live
by
it
would
have
been
starkly
sufficient
.
But
sometimes
,
on
the
darkest
nights
,
when
the
waves
pounded
the
shingle
like
bursts
of
distant
gunfire
,
both
the
science
and
the
symbol
would
seem
to
him
as
transitory
as
those
drowned
lives
and
he
would
find
himself
wondering
if
this
great
hulk
would
one
day
yield
to
the
sea
,
like
the
wave-smashed
concrete
from
the
last
war
defences
,
and
like
them
become
a
broken
symbol
of
man
's
long
history
on
this
desolate
coast
.
Or
would
it
resist
even
time
and
the
North
Sea
and
still
be
standing
when
the
final
darkness
fell
over
the
planet
?
In
his
more
pessimistic
moments
some
rogue
part
of
his
mind
knew
this
darkness
to
be
inevitable
,
although
he
did
not
expect
it
to
come
in
his
time
,
maybe
not
even
in
his
son
's
.
He
would
sometimes
smile
wryly
,
telling
himself
that
he
and
Neil
Pascoe
,
on
different
sides
,
would
understand
each
other
well
.
The
only
difference
was
that
one
of
them
had
hope
.
Jane
Dalgliesh
had
bought
Larksoken
Mill
five
years
earlier
when
she
had
moved
from
her
previous
home
on
the
Suffolk
coast
.
The
mill
,
which
was
built
in
1525
,
was
a
picturesque
brick
tower
,
four
storeys
high
with
an
octagonal
dome
cap
and
skeleton
fantail
.
It
had
been
converted
some
years
before
Miss
Dalgliesh
had
bought
it
by
the
addition
of
a
flint-faced
,
two-storey
building
with
a
large
sitting
room
,
smaller
study
and
a
kitchen
on
the
ground
floor
and
three
bedrooms
,
two
of
them
with
their
own
bathrooms
,
on
the
floor
above
.
Dalgliesh
had
never
asked
her
why
she
had
moved
to
Norfolk
but
he
guessed
that
the
mill
's
main
attraction
had
been
its
remoteness
,
its
closeness
to
notable
bird
sanctuaries
and
the
impressive
view
of
headland
,
sky
and
sea
from
the
top
storey
.
Perhaps
she
had
intended
to
restore
it
to
working
order
but
with
increasing
age
had
n't
been
able
to
summon
the
energy
or
enthusiasm
to
cope
with
the
disturbance
.
He
had
inherited
it
as
an
agreeable
but
mildly
onerous
responsibility
,
together
with
her
considerable
fortune
.
The
origin
of
that
had
only
become
plain
after
her
death
.
It
had
originally
been
left
to
her
by
a
noted
amateur
ornithologist
and
eccentric
with
whom
she
had
been
friendly
for
many
years
.
Whether
the
relationship
had
gone
beyond
friendship
Dalgliesh
would
now
never
know
.
She
had
,
apparently
,
spent
little
of
the
money
on
herself
,
had
been
a
dependable
benefactress
of
the
few
eccentric
charities
of
which
she
approved
,
had
remembered
them
in
her
will
,
but
without
egregious
generosity
,
and
had
left
the
residue
of
her
estate
to
him
without
explanation
,
admonition
or
peculiar
protestations
of
affection
,
although
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
words
"
my
dearly
beloved
nephew
"
meant
exactly
what
they
said
.
He
had
liked
her
,
respected
her
,
had
always
been
at
ease
in
her
company
,
but
he
had
never
thought
that
he
really
knew
her
,
and
now
he
never
would
.
He
was
a
little
surprised
how
much
he
minded
.
The
only
change
she
had
made
to
the
property
was
to
build
a
garage
,
and
after
he
had
unloaded
and
put
away
the
Jaguar
he
decided
to
climb
to
the
top
chamber
of
the
mill
while
it
was
still
light
.
The
bottom
room
,
with
Its
two
huge
grinding-wheels
of
burr-granite
propped
against
the
wall
and
its
lingering
smell
of
flour
,
still
held
an
air
of
mystery
,
of
time
held
in
abeyance
,
of
a
place
bereft
of
its
purpose
and
meaning
,
so
that
he
never
entered
it
without
a
slight
sense
of
desolation
.
There
were
only
ladders
between
the
floors
and
,
as
he
grasped
the
rungs
,
he
saw
again
his
aunt
's
long
trousered
legs
ahead
of
him
disappearing
into
the
chamber
above
.
She
had
used
only
the
top
room
of
the
mill
which
she
had
furnished
simply
with
a
small
writing
table
and
chair
facing
the
North
Sea
,
a
telephone
and
her
binoculars
.
Entering
it
he
could
imagine
her
sitting
there
in
the
summer
days
and
evenings
,
working
on
the
papers
which
she
occasionally
contributed
to
ornithological
journals
and
looking
up
from
time
to
time
to
gaze
out
over
the
headland
to
the
sea
and
the
far
horizon
,
could
see
again
that
carved
,
weather-browned
Aztec
face
with
its
hooded
eyes
under
the
grey-black
hair
,
drawn
back
into
a
bun
,
could
hear
again
a
voice
which
,
for
him
,
had
been
one
of
the
most
beautiful
female
voices
he
had
ever
heard
.
Now
it
was
late
afternoon
and
the
headland
lay
enriched
by
the
mellow
afternoon
light
,
the
sea
a
wide
expanse
of
wrinkled
blue
with
a
painter
's
stroke
of
purple
laid
on
the
horizon
.
The
colours
and
shapes
were
intensified
by
the
sun
's
last
strong
rays
so
that
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
looked
unreal
,
a
golden
fantasy
against
the
blue
of
the
sea
,
and
the
dry
grass
gleamed
as
richly
as
a
lush
water
meadow
.
There
was
a
window
at
each
of
the
compass
points
,
and
,
binoculars
in
hand
,
he
made
his
slow
perambulation
.
To
the
west
his
eyes
could
travel
along
the
narrow
road
between
the
reed
beds
and
the
dykes
to
the
flint-walled
and
Dutch-gabled
cottages
and
the
pantiled
roofs
of
Lydsett
village
and
the
round
tower
of
St
Andrew
's
Church
.
To
the
north
the
view
was
dominated
by
the
huge
bulk
of
the
power
station
,
the
low-roofed
administration
block
with
,
behind
it
,
the
reactor
building
and
the
great
steel
,
aluminium-clad
building
of
the
turbine
house
.
Four
hundred
metres
out
to
sea
were
the
rigs
and
platforms
of
the
intake
structures
through
which
the
cooling
sea
water
passed
to
the
pump
house
and
the
circulating
water
pumps
.
He
moved
again
to
the
eastern
window
and
looked
out
over
the
cottages
of
the
headland
.
Far
to
the
south
he
could
just
glimpse
the
roof
of
Scudder
's
Cottage
.
Directly
to
his
left
the
flint
walls
of
Martyr
's
Cottage
glistened
like
marbles
in
the
afternoon
sun
and
less
than
half
a
mile
to
the
north
,
set
back
among
the
Californian
pines
which
fringed
that
part
of
the
coast
,
was
the
dull
square
cottage
rented
by
Hilary
Robarts
,
a
neatly
proportional
suburban
villa
incongruously
set
down
on
this
bleak
headland
and
facing
inland
as
if
resolutely
ignoring
the
sea
.
Further
inland
,
and
only
just
visible
from
the
southern
window
was
the
Old
Rectory
,
set
like
a
Victorian
dolls
'
house
in
its
large
,
overgrown
garden
which
,
at
this
distance
,
looked
as
neatly
green
and
formal
as
a
municipal
park
.
The
telephone
rang
.
The
strident
peal
was
unwelcome
.
It
was
to
get
away
from
such
intrusions
that
he
had
come
to
Larksoken
.
But
the
call
was
not
unexpected
.
It
was
Terry
Rickards
saying
that
he
would
like
to
drop
in
for
a
chat
with
Mr
Dalgliesh
if
it
would
n't
be
too
much
bother
and
would
nine
be
convenient
?
Dalgliesh
was
unable
to
think
of
a
single
excuse
why
it
should
n't
be
.
Ten
minutes
later
he
left
the
tower
,
locking
the
door
after
him
.
This
precaution
was
a
small
act
of
piety
.
His
aunt
had
always
kept
the
door
locked
,
fearing
that
children
might
venture
into
the
mill
and
hurt
themselves
by
tumbling
down
the
ladders
.
Leaving
the
tower
to
its
darkness
and
its
solitude
,
he
went
into
Mill
Cottage
to
unpack
and
get
his
supper
.
The
huge
sitting
room
with
its
York
stone
floor
,
rugs
and
open
fireplace
was
a
comfortable
and
nostalgic
mixture
of
the
old
and
the
new
.
Most
of
the
furniture
was
familiar
to
him
from
boyhood
visits
to
his
grandparents
,
inherited
by
his
aunt
as
the
last
of
her
generation
.
Only
the
music
centre
and
the
television
set
were
comparatively
new
.
Music
had
been
important
to
her
and
the
shelves
held
a
catholic
collection
of
records
with
which
he
could
refresh
or
console
himself
during
the
two
weeks
'
holiday
.
And
next
door
,
the
kitchen
contained
nothing
superfluous
but
everything
necessary
to
a
woman
who
enjoyed
food
but
preferred
to
cook
it
with
a
minimum
of
fuss
.
He
put
a
couple
of
lamb
chops
under
the
grill
,
made
a
green
salad
and
prepared
to
enjoy
a
few
hours
of
solitude
before
the
intrusion
of
Rickards
and
his
preoccupations
.
It
still
surprised
him
a
little
that
his
aunt
had
finally
bought
a
television
set
.
Had
she
been
seduced
into
conformity
by
the
excellence
of
the
natural
history
programmes
and
then
,
like
other
late
converts
he
had
known
,
sat
captive
to
virtually
every
offering
as
if
making
up
for
lost
time
?
That
at
least
seemed
unlikely
.
He
switched
on
to
see
if
the
set
was
still
working
.
A
jerking
pop
star
was
wielding
his
guitar
as
the
credits
rolled
,
his
parodic
sexual
gyrations
so
grotesque
that
it
was
difficult
to
see
that
even
the
besotted
young
could
find
them
erotic
.
Switching
off
,
Dalgliesh
looked
up
at
the
oil
portrait
of
his
maternal
great-grandfather
,
the
Victorian
bishop
,
robed
but
unmitred
,
his
arms
in
their
billowing
lawn
sleeves
confidently
resting
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
.
He
had
an
impulse
to
say
,
"
This
is
the
music
of
1988
;
these
are
our
heroes
;
that
building
on
the
headland
is
our
architecture
and
I
dare
not
stop
my
car
to
help
children
home
because
they
've
been
taught
with
good
reason
that
a
strange
man
might
abduct
and
rape
them
.
"
He
could
have
added
,
"
And
out
there
somewhere
is
a
mass
murderer
who
enjoys
strangling
women
and
stuffing
their
mouths
with
their
hair
.
"
But
that
aberration
,
at
least
,
was
independent
of
changing
fashions
and
his
great-grandfather
would
have
had
his
scrupulous
but
uncompromising
answer
to
it
.
And
with
reason
.
After
all
,
had
n't
he
been
consecrated
bishop
in
1880
,
the
year
of
Jack
the
Ripper
?
And
probably
he
would
have
found
the
Whistler
more
understandable
than
the
pop
star
whose
gyrations
would
surely
have
convinced
him
that
man
was
in
the
grip
of
his
final
,
manic
St
Vitus
's
dance
.
Rickards
came
promptly
on
time
.
It
was
precisely
nine
when
Dalgliesh
heard
his
car
and
,
opening
the
door
on
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
saw
his
tall
figure
striding
towards
him
.
Dalgliesh
had
n't
seen
him
for
more
than
ten
years
when
he
had
been
a
newly
appointed
inspector
in
the
Metropolitan
CID
and
was
surprised
to
see
how
little
he
had
changed
;
time
,
marriage
,
removal
from
London
,
promotion
,
had
left
no
apparent
mark
on
him
.
His
rangy
,
graceless
figure
,
over
six
feet
high
,
still
looked
as
incongruous
in
a
formal
suit
as
it
always
had
.
The
rugged
,
weatherbeaten
face
,
with
its
look
of
dependable
fortitude
,
would
have
looked
more
appropriate
above
a
seaman
's
guernsey
,
preferably
with
RNLI
woven
across
the
chest
.
In
profile
his
face
,
with
the
long
,
slightly
hooked
nose
and
jutting
eyebrows
,
was
impressive
.
In
full
face
the
nose
was
revealed
as
a
little
too
wide
and
flattened
at
the
base
and
the
dark
eyes
,
which
when
he
was
animated
took
on
a
fierce
,
almost
manic
gleam
,
in
repose
were
pools
of
puzzled
endurance
.
Dalgliesh
thought
of
him
as
a
type
of
police
officer
less
common
than
formerly
but
still
not
rare
;
the
conscientious
and
incorruptible
detective
of
limited
imagination
and
somewhat
greater
intelligence
who
had
never
supposed
that
the
evil
of
the
world
should
be
condoned
because
it
was
frequently
inexplicable
and
its
perpetrators
unfortunate
.
He
gazed
round
the
sitting
room
at
the
long
wall
of
books
,
the
crackling
wood
fire
,
the
oil
of
the
Victorian
prelate
above
the
mantelshelf
as
if
deliberately
impressing
each
item
on
his
mind
,
then
sank
into
his
chair
and
stretched
out
his
long
legs
with
a
small
grunt
of
satisfaction
.
Dalgliesh
remembered
that
he
had
always
drunk
beer
;
now
he
accepted
whisky
but
said
he
could
do
with
coffee
first
.
One
habit
at
least
had
changed
.
He
said
:
"
I
'm
sorry
that
you
wo
n't
be
meeting
Susie
,
my
wife
,
while
you
're
here
,
Mr
Dalgliesh
.
She
's
having
our
first
baby
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
she
's
gone
to
stay
with
her
mother
in
York
.
Ma-in-law
did
n't
like
the
idea
of
her
being
in
Norfolk
with
the
Whistler
on
the
prowl
,
not
with
me
working
the
hours
I
do
.
"
It
was
said
with
a
kind
of
embarrassed
formality
as
if
he
,
not
Dalgliesh
,
were
the
host
and
he
was
apologizing
for
the
unexpected
absence
of
the
hostess
.
He
added
:
"
I
suppose
it
's
natural
for
an
only
daughter
to
want
to
be
with
her
mother
at
a
time
like
this
,
particularly
with
a
first
baby
.
"
Dalgliesh
's
wife
had
n't
wanted
to
be
with
her
mother
,
she
had
wanted
to
be
with
him
,
had
wanted
it
with
such
intensity
that
he
had
wondered
afterwards
whether
she
might
have
felt
a
premonition
.
He
could
remember
that
,
although
he
could
no
longer
recall
her
face
.
His
memory
of
her
,
which
for
years
,
a
traitor
to
grief
and
to
their
love
,
he
had
resolutely
tried
to
suppress
because
the
pain
had
seemed
unbearable
,
had
gradually
been
replaced
by
a
boyish
,
romantic
dream
of
gentleness
and
beauty
now
fixed
for
ever
beyond
the
depredation
of
time
.
His
newborn
son
's
face
he
could
still
recall
vividly
and
sometimes
did
in
his
dreams
,
that
white
unsullied
look
of
sweet
knowledgeable
contentment
,
as
if
,
in
a
brief
moment
of
life
,
he
had
seen
and
known
all
there
was
to
know
,
seen
it
and
rejected
it
.
He
told
himself
that
he
was
the
last
man
who
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
advise
or
reassure
on
the
problems
of
pregnancy
and
he
sensed
that
Rickards
's
unhappiness
at
his
wife
's
absence
went
deeper
than
missing
her
company
.
He
made
the
usual
inquiries
about
her
health
and
escaped
into
the
kitchen
to
make
the
coffee
.
Whatever
mysterious
spirit
had
unlocked
the
verse
,
it
had
freed
him
for
other
human
satisfactions
,
for
love
;
or
was
it
the
other
way
around
?
Had
love
unlocked
the
verse
?
It
seemed
even
to
have
affected
his
job
.
Grinding
the
coffee
beans
he
pondered
life
's
smaller
ambiguities
.
When
the
poetry
had
n't
come
,
the
job
too
had
seemed
not
only
irksome
but
occasionally
repellent
.
Now
he
was
happy
enough
to
let
Rickards
impose
on
his
solitude
to
use
him
as
a
sounding
board
.
This
new
benignity
and
tolerance
a
little
disconcerted
him
.
Success
in
moderation
was
no
doubt
better
for
the
character
than
failure
but
too
much
of
it
and
he
would
lose
his
cutting
edge
.
And
five
minutes
later
,
carrying
in
the
two
mugs
and
settling
back
in
his
chair
,
he
could
relish
the
contrast
between
Rickards
's
preoccupation
with
psychopathic
violence
and
the
peace
of
the
mill
.
The
wood
fire
,
now
past
its
crackling
stage
,
had
settled
into
a
comfortable
glow
and
the
wind
,
seldom
absent
from
the
headland
,
moved
like
a
benign
,
gently
hissing
spirit
through
the
still
and
soaring
clappers
of
the
mill
.
He
was
glad
that
it
was
n't
his
job
to
catch
the
Whistler
.
Of
all
murders
serial
killings
were
the
most
frustrating
,
the
most
difficult
and
the
chanciest
to
solve
,
the
investigation
carried
on
under
the
strain
of
vociferous
public
demand
that
the
terrifying
unknown
devil
be
caught
and
exorcized
for
ever
.
But
this
was
n't
his
case
;
he
could
discuss
it
with
the
detachment
of
a
man
who
has
a
professional
interest
but
no
responsibility
.
And
he
could
understand
what
Rickards
needed
;
not
advice
-
he
knew
his
job
-
.
but
someone
he
could
trust
,
someone
who
understood
the
language
,
someone
who
would
afterwards
be
gone
,
who
would
n't
remain
as
a
perpetual
reminder
of
his
uncertainties
,
a
fellow
professional
to
whom
he
could
comfortably
think
aloud
.
He
had
his
team
and
he
was
too
punctilious
not
to
share
his
thinking
with
them
.
But
he
was
a
man
who
needed
to
articulate
his
theories
and
here
he
could
put
them
forward
,
embroider
,
reject
,
explore
without
the
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
his
detective
sergeant
,
deferentially
listening
,
his
face
carefully
expressionless
,
would
be
thinking
,
For
God
's
sake
,
what
's
the
old
man
dreaming
up
now
?
Or
,
The
old
man
's
getting
fanciful
.
Rickards
said
:
"
We
're
not
using
Holmes
.
The
Met
say
the
system
is
fully
committed
at
present
,
and
anyway
we
've
got
our
own
computer
.
Not
that
there
's
much
data
to
feed
in
.
The
press
and
public
know
about
Holmes
,
of
course
.
I
get
that
at
every
press
conference
.
"
Are
you
using
the
Home
Office
special
computer
,
the
one
named
after
Sherlock
Holmes
?
'
"
"
No
,
'
"
I
say
,
"
"
but
we
're
using
our
own
.
'
"
Unspoken
question
:
"
Then
why
the
hell
have
n't
you
caught
him
?
'
"
They
think
that
you
've
only
got
to
feed
in
your
data
and
out
pops
an
Identikit
of
sonny
complete
with
prints
,
collar-size
and
taste
in
pop
music
.
"
"
Yes
,
"
said
Dalgliesh
,
'we
're
so
sated
now
with
scientific
wonders
that
it
's
a
bit
disconcerting
when
we
find
that
technology
can
do
everything
except
what
we
want
it
to
.
"
"
Four
women
so
far
and
Valerie
Mitchell
wo
n't
be
the
last
if
we
do
n't
catch
him
soon
.
He
started
fifteen
months
ago
.
The
first
victim
was
found
just
after
midnight
in
a
shelter
at
the
end
of
the
Easthaven
promenade
,
the
local
tart
,
incidentally
,
although
he
may
not
have
known
or
cared
.
It
was
eight
months
before
he
struck
again
.
Struck
lucky
,
I
suppose
he
'd
say
.
This
time
a
thirty-year-old
schoolteacher
cycling
home
to
Hunstanton
who
had
a
puncture
on
a
lonely
stretch
of
road
.
Then
another
gap
,
just
six
months
,
before
he
got
a
barmaid
from
Ipswich
who
'd
been
visiting
her
granny
and
was
daft
enough
to
wait
alone
for
the
late
bus
.
When
it
arrived
there
was
no
one
at
the
stop
.
A
couple
of
local
youths
got
off
.
They
'd
had
a
skinful
so
were
n't
in
a
particularly
noticing
mood
but
they
saw
and
heard
nothing
,
nothing
except
what
they
described
as
a
kind
of
mournful
whistling
coming
from
deep
in
the
wood
.
"
He
took
a
gulp
of
his
coffee
,
then
went
on
:
"
We
've
got
a
personality
assessment
from
the
trick-cyclist
.
I
do
n't
know
why
we
bother
.
I
could
have
written
it
myself
.
He
tells
us
to
look
for
a
loner
,
probably
from
a
disturbed
family
background
,
may
have
a
dominant
mother
,
does
n't
relate
easily
to
people
,
particularly
women
,
could
be
impotent
,
unmarried
,
separated
or
divorced
,
with
a
resentment
and
hatred
of
the
opposite
sex
.
Well
,
we
hardly
expect
him
to
be
a
successful
,
happily
married
bank
manager
with
four
lovely
kids
just
coming
up
to
GCE
or
whatever
they
call
it
now
.
They
're
the
devil
,
these
serial
murders
.
No
motive
-
no
motive
that
a
sane
man
can
understand
anyway
-
and
he
could
come
from
anywhere
,
Norwich
,
Ipswich
,
even
London
.
It
's
dangerous
to
assume
that
he
's
necessarily
working
in
his
own
territory
.
Looks
like
it
,
though
.
He
obviously
knows
the
locality
well
.
And
he
seems
to
be
sticking
now
to
the
same
MO
.
He
chooses
a
road
intersection
,
drives
the
car
or
van
into
the
side
of
one
road
,
cuts
across
and
waits
at
the
other
.
Then
he
drags
his
victim
into
the
bushes
or
the
trees
,
kills
and
cuts
back
to
the
other
road
and
the
car
and
makes
his
getaway
.
With
the
last
three
murders
it
seems
to
have
been
pure
chance
that
a
suitable
victim
did
,
in
fact
,
come
along
.
"
Dalgliesh
felt
that
it
was
time
he
contributed
something
to
the
speculation
.
He
said
:
"
If
he
does
n't
select
and
stalk
his
victim
,
and
obviously
he
did
n't
in
the
last
three
cases
,
he
'd
normally
have
to
expect
a
long
wait
.
That
suggests
he
's
routinely
out
after
dark
,
a
night
worker
,
mole-catcher
,
woodman
,
gamekeeper
,
that
kind
of
job
.
And
he
goes
prepared
;
on
the
watch
for
a
quick
kill
,
in
more
ways
than
one
.
"
Rickards
said
:
'That
's
how
I
see
it
.
Four
victims
so
far
and
three
fortuitous
,
but
he
's
probably
been
on
the
prowl
for
three
years
or
more
.
That
could
be
part
of
the
thrill
.
"
Tonight
I
could
make
a
strike
,
tonight
I
could
be
lucky
.
And
,
by
God
,
he
is
getting
lucky
.
Two
victims
in
the
last
six
weeks
.
"
"
And
what
about
his
trademark
,
the
whistle
?
"
That
was
heard
by
the
three
people
who
came
quickly
on
the
scene
after
the
Easthaven
murder
.
One
just
heard
a
whistle
,
one
said
it
sounded
like
a
hymn
and
the
third
,
who
was
a
church
woman
,
claimed
she
could
identify
it
precisely
,
"
Now
the
Day
is
Over'
"
.
We
kept
quiet
about
that
.
It
could
be
useful
when
we
get
the
usual
clutch
of
nutters
claiming
they
're
the
Whistler
.
But
there
seems
no
doubt
that
he
does
whistle
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
"
Now
the
day
is
over
/
Night
is
drawing
nigh/
Shadows
of
the
evening/
Fall
across
the
sky'
"
.
It
's
a
Sunday-school
hymn
,
hardly
the
kind
that
gets
requested
on
Songs
of
Praise
,
I
should
have
thought
.
"
He
remembered
it
from
childhood
,
a
lugubrious
,
undistinguished
tune
which
,
as
a
ten-year-old
,
he
could
pick
out
on
the
drawing-room
piano
.
Did
anyone
sing
that
hymn
now
,
he
wondered
?
It
had
been
a
favourite
choice
of
Miss
Barnett
on
those
long
dark
afternoons
m-
winter
before
the
Sunday
school
was
released
,
when
the
outside
light
was
fading
and
the
small
Adam
Dalgliesh
was
already
dreading
those
last
twenty
yards
of
his
walk
home
where
the
rectory
drive
curved
and
the
bushes
grew
thickest
.
Night
was
different
from
bright
day
,
smelt
different
,
sounded
different
;
ordinary
things
assumed
different
shapes
;
an
alien
and
more
sinister
power
ruled
the
night
.
Those
twenty
yards
of
crunching
gravel
where
the
lights
of
the
house
were
momentarily
screened
were
a
weekly
horror
.
Once
through
the
gate
to
the
drive
he
would
walk
fast
,
but
not
too
fast
since
the
power
that
ruled
the
night
could
smell
out
fear
as
dogs
smell
out
terror
.
His
mother
,
he
knew
,
would
never
have
expected
him
to
walk
those
yards
alone
had
she
known
that
he
suffered
such
atavistic
panic
,
but
she
had
n't
known
and
he
would
have
died
before
telling
her
.
And
his
father
?
His
father
would
have
expected
him
to
be
brave
,
would
have
told
him
that
God
was
God
of
the
darkness
as
He
was
of
the
light
.
There
were
after
all
a
dozen
appropriate
texts
he
could
have
quoted
.
"
Darkness
and
light
are
both
alike
to
Thee
.
"
But
they
were
not
alike
to
a
sensitive
ten-year-old
boy
.
It
was
on
those
lonely
walks
that
he
had
first
had
intimations
of
an
essentially
adult
truth
,
that
it
is
those
who
most
love
us
who
cause
us
the
most
pain
.
He
said
:
"
So
you
're
looking
for
a
local
man
,
a
Loner
,
someone
who
has
a
night
job
,
the
use
of
a
car
or
van
and
a
knowledge
of
Hymns
Ancient
and
Modern
.
That
should
make
it
easier
.
"
Rickards
said
:
"
You
'd
think
so
,
would
n't
you
.
"
He
sat
in
silence
for
a
minute
then
said
:
'l
think
I
'd
like
just
a
small
whisky
now
,
Mr
Dalgliesh
,
if
it
's
all
the
same
to
you
.
"
It
was
after
midnight
when
he
finally
left
.
Dalgliesh
walked
out
with
him
to
the
car
.
Looking
out
across
the
headland
Rickards
said
:
"
He
's
out
there
somewhere
,
watching
,
waiting
.
There
's
hardly
a
waking
moment
when
I
do
n't
think
of
him
,
imagine
what
he
looks
like
,
where
he
is
,
what
he
's
thinking
.
Susie
's
ma
is
right
.
I
have
n't
had
much
to
give
her
recently
.
And
when
he
's
caught
,
that
'll
be
the
end
.
It
's
finished
.
You
move
on
.
He
does
n't
,
but
you
do
.
And
by
the
end
you
know
everything
,
or
think
you
do
.
Where
,
when
,
who
,
how
?
You
might
even
know
why
if
you
're
lucky
.
And
yet
,
essentially
,
you
know
nothing
.
All
that
wickedness
,
and
you
do
n't
have
to
explain
it
or
understand
it
or
do
a
bloody
thing
about
it
except
put
a
stop
to
it
.
Involvement
without
responsibility
.
No
responsibility
for
what
he
did
or
for
what
happens
to
him
afterwards
.
That
's
for
the
judge
and
the
jury
.
You
're
involved
,
and
yet
you
're
not
involved
.
Is
that
what
appeals
to
you
about
the
job
,
Mr
Dalgliesh
?
"
It
was
not
a
question
Dalgliesh
would
have
expected
,
even
from
a
friend
,
and
Rickards
was
not
a
friend
.
He
said
:
"
Can
any
of
us
answer
that
question
?
"
"
You
remember
why
I
left
the
Met
,
Mr
Dalgliesh
.
"
The
two
corruption
cases
?
Yes
,
I
remember
why
you
left
the
Met
.
"
"
And
you
stayed
.
You
did
n't
like
it
any
more
than
I
did
.
You
would
n't
have
touched
the
pitch
.
But
you
stayed
.
You
were
detached
about
it
all
,
were
n't
you
?
It
interested
you
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
It
's
always
interesting
when
men
you
thought
you
knew
behave
out
of
character
.
"
And
Rickards
had
fled
from
London
.
In
search
of
what
?
Dalgliesh
wondered
.
Some
romantic
dream
of
country
peace
,
an
England
which
had
vanished
,
a
gentler
method
of
policing
,
total
honesty
?
He
wondered
whether
he
had
found
it
.
It
was
ten
past
seven
and
the
saloon
bar
of
the
Duke
of
Clarence
pub
was
already
smoke-filled
,
the
noise
level
rising
and
the
crowd
at
the
bar
three
feet
deep
.
Christine
Baldwin
,
the
Whistler
's
fifth
victim
,
had
exactly
twenty
minutes
to
live
.
She
sat
on
the
banquette
against
the
wall
,
sipping
her
second
medium
sherry
of
the
evening
,
deliberately
making
it
last
,
knowing
that
Colin
was
impatient
to
order
the
next
round
.
Catching
Norman
's
eye
,
she
raised
her
left
wrist
and
nodded
significantly
at
her
watch
.
Already
,
it
was
ten
minutes
past
their
deadline
and
he
knew
it
.
Their
agreement
was
that
this
was
to
be
a
pre-supper
drink
with
Colin
and
Yvonne
,
the
limit
both
of
time
and
alcohol
consumption
clearly
understood
between
her
and
Norman
before
they
left
home
.
The
arrangement
was
typical
of
their
nine-month-old
marriage
,
sustained
less
by
compatible
interests
than
by
a
carefully
negotiated
series
of
concessions
.
Tonight
it
had
been
her
turn
to
give
way
,
but
agreeing
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
Clarence
with
Colin
and
Yvonne
did
n't
extend
to
any
pretence
that
she
actually
enjoyed
their
company
.
She
had
disliked
Colin
since
their
first
meeting
;
the
relationship
,
at
a
glance
,
had
been
fixed
in
the
stereotyped
antagonism
between
newly
acquired
fiancee
and
slightly
disreputable
old
schoolmate
and
drinking
partner
.
He
had
been
best
man
at
their
wedding
-
a
formidable
pre-nuptial
agreement
had
been
necessary
for
that
capitulation
-
and
had
carried
out
his
duties
with
a
mixture
of
incompetence
,
vulgarity
and
irreverence
which
,
as
she
occasionally
enjoyed
telling
Norman
,
had
spoilt
for
her
the
memory
of
her
big
day
.
It
was
typical
of
him
to
choose
this
pub
.
God
knew
,
it
was
vulgar
enough
.
But
at
least
she
could
be
certain
of
one
thing
:
it
was
n't
a
place
where
there
was
a
risk
of
meeting
anyone
from
the
power
station
,
at
least
not
anyone
who
mattered
.
She
disliked
everything
about
the
Clarence
,
the
rough
scrape
of
the
moquette
against
her
legs
,
the
synthetic
velvet
which
covered
the
walls
,
the
baskets
of
ivy
spiked
with
artificial
flowers
above
the
bar
,
the
gaudiness
of
the
carpet
.
Twenty
years
ago
,
it
had
been
a
cosy
Victorian
hostelry
,
seldom
visited
except
by
its
regulars
,
with
an
open
fire
in
winter
and
horse
brasses
polished
to
whiteness
hung
against
the
black
beams
.
The
lugubrious
publican
had
seen
it
as
his
job
to
repel
strangers
and
had
employed
to
that
end
an
impressive
armoury
of
taciturnity
,
malevolent
glances
,
warm
beer
and
poor
service
.
But
the
old
pub
had
burnt
down
in
the
1960s
and
been
replaced
by
a
more
profitable
and
thrusting
enterprise
.
Nothing
of
the
old
building
remained
and
the
long
extension
to
the
bar
,
dignified
by
the
name
Banqueting
Hall
,
provided
for
the
undiscriminating
a
venue
for
weddings
and
local
functions
and
on
other
nights
served
a
predictable
menu
of
prawns
or
soup
,
steak
or
chicken
,
and
fruit
salad
with
ice-cream
.
Well
,
at
least
she
had
put
her
foot
down
over
dinner
.
They
had
worked
out
their
monthly
budget
to
the
last
pound
,
and
if
Norman
thought
she
was
going
to
eat
this
overpriced
muck
with
a
perfectly
good
cold
supper
waiting
in
the
refrigerator
at
home
and
a
decent
programme
on
the
telly
he
could
forget
it
.
And
they
had
better
uses
for
their
money
than
to
sit
here
drinking
with
Colin
and
his
latest
tart
who
had
opened
her
legs
to
half
Norwich
,
if
rumour
were
to
be
believed
.
There
were
the
hire
purchase
repayments
on
the
sitting-room
furniture
and
the
car
,
not
to
mention
the
mortgage
.
She
tried
again
to
meet
Norman
's
eye
but
he
was
rather
desperately
keeping
his
attention
on
that
slut
Yvonne
.
And
that
was
n't
proving
difficult
.
Colin
leaned
over
to
her
,
his
bold
treacle-brown
eyes
half
mocking
,
half
inviting
,
Colin
Lomas
,
who
thought
every
woman
would
swoon
when
he
beckoned
.
"
Relax
,
darling
.
Your
old
man
's
enjoying
himself
.
It
's
your
round
,
Norm
.
"
Ignoring
Colin
she
spoke
to
Norman
:
"
Look
,
it
's
time
we
were
going
.
We
agreed
we
'd
leave
at
seven
.
"
"
Oh
,
come
on
,
Chrissie
,
give
the
lad
a
break
.
One
more
round
.
"
Without
meeting
her
eyes
,
Norman
said
:
"
What
'll
you
have
,
Yvonne
?
The
same
again
?
Medium
sherry
?
"
Colin
said
:
"
Let's
get
on
to
spirits
.
I
'll
have
a
Johnny
Walker
.
"
He
was
doing
it
on
purpose
.
She
knew
that
he
did
n't
even
like
whisky
.
She
said
:
"
Look
,
I
've
had
enough
of
this
bloody
place
.
The
noise
has
given
me
a
head
.
"
"
A
headache
?
Nine
months
married
and
she
's
started
the
headaches
.
No
point
in
hurrying
home
tonight
,
Norm
.
"
Yvonne
giggled
.
Christine
said
,
her
face
burning
,
"
You
were
always
vulgar
,
Colin
Lomas
,
but
now
you
're
not
even
funny
with
it
.
You
three
can
do
what
you
like
.
I
'm
going
home
.
Give
me
the
car
keys
.
"
Colin
leaned
back
and
smiled
.
"
You
heard
what
your
lady
wife
said
.
She
wants
the
car
keys
.
"
Without
a
word
,
shamefaced
,
Norman
took
them
out
of
his
pocket
and
slid
them
over
the
table
.
She
snatched
them
up
,
pushed
back
the
table
,
struggled
past
Yvonne
and
rushed
to
the
door
.
She
was
almost
crying
with
rage
.
It
took
her
a
minute
to
unlock
the
car
and
then
she
sat
shaking
behind
the
wheel
,
waiting
until
her
hands
were
steady
enough
to
switch
on
the
ignition
.
She
heard
her
mother
's
voice
on
the
day
when
she
had
announced
her
engagement
:
"
Well
,
you
're
thirty-two
and
if
he
's
what
you
want
I
suppose
you
know
your
own
mind
.
But
you
'll
never
make
anything
of
him
.
Weak
as
water
,
if
you
ask
me
.
"
But
she
had
thought
that
she
could
make
something
of
him
and
that
small
semi-detached
house
outside
Norwich
represented
nine
months
of
hard
work
and
achievement
.
Next
year
he
was
due
for
promotion
at
the
insurance
office
.
She
would
be
able
to
give
up
her
job
as
secretary
in
the
medical
physics
department
at
Larksoken
Power
Station
and
start
the
first
of
the
two
children
she
had
planned
.
She
would
be
thirty-four
by
then
.
Everyone
knew
that
you
should
n't
wait
too
long
.
She
had
only
passed
her
driving
test
after
her
marriage
and
this
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
driven
unaccompanied
by
night
.
She
drove
slowly
and
carefully
,
her
anxious
eyes
peering
ahead
,
glad
that
at
least
the
route
home
was
familiar
.
She
wondered
what
Norman
would
do
when
he
saw
that
the
car
had
gone
.
Almost
certainly
he
would
expect
to
find
her
sitting
there
,
fuming
but
ready
to
be
driven
home
.
Now
he
'd
have
to
rely
for
a
lift
on
Colin
who
would
n't
be
so
keen
on
coming
out
of
his
way
.
And
if
they
thought
that
she
was
going
to
invite
Colin
and
Yvonne
in
for
a
drink
when
they
arrived
they
would
get
a
shock
.
The
thought
of
Norman
's
discomfiture
at
finding
her
gone
cheered
her
a
little
and
she
pressed
her
foot
down
on
the
accelerator
,
anxious
to
distance
herself
from
the
three
of
them
,
to
reach
the
safety
of
home
.
But
suddenly
the
car
gave
a
stutter
and
the
engine
died
.
She
must
have
been
driving
more
erratically
than
she
thought
for
she
found
herself
half
skewed
across
the
road
.
It
was
a
bad
place
to
be
stranded
,
a
lonely
stretch
of
country
lane
with
a
thin
band
of
trees
on
either
side
and
it
was
deserted
.
And
then
she
remembered
.
Norman
had
mentioned
that
they
needed
to
fill
up
with
petrol
and
must
be
sure
to
call
at
the
all-night
garage
after
they
left
the
Clarence
.
It
was
ridiculous
to
have
let
the
tank
get
so
low
but
they
had
had
an
argument
only
three
days
earlier
on
whose
turn
it
was
to
call
at
the
garage
and
pay
for
the
petrol
.
All
her
anger
and
frustration
returned
.
For
a
moment
she
sat
there
,
beating
her
hands
impotently
on
the
wheel
,
desperately
turning
the
key
in
the
ignition
,
willing
the
engine
to
start
.
But
there
was
no
response
.
And
then
irritation
began
to
give
way
to
the
first
tricklings
of
fear
.
The
road
was
deserted
and
even
if
a
motorist
came
by
and
drew
up
,
could
she
be
certain
that
he
was
n't
a
kidnapper
,
a
rapist
,
even
the
Whistler
?
There
had
been
that
horrible
murder
on
the
A3
only
this
year
.
Nowadays
you
could
trust
no
one
.
And
she
could
hardly
leave
the
car
where
it
was
,
slewed
across
the
road
.
She
tried
to
recall
when
she
had
last
passed
a
house
,
an
AA
box
,
a
public
telephone
,
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
driving
through
deserted
countryside
for
at
least
ten
minutes
.
Even
if
she
left
the
dubious
sanctuary
of
the
car
she
had
no
clue
to
the
best
direction
in
which
to
seek
help
.
Suddenly
a
wave
of
total
panic
swept
across
her
like
nausea
and
she
had
to
resist
the
urge
to
dash
from
the
car
and
hide
herself
among
the
trees
.
But
what
good
would
that
do
?
He
might
be
lurking
even
there
.
An
then
,
miraculously
,
she
heard
footsteps
and
,
looking
round
,
saw
a
woman
approaching
.
She
was
dressed
in
trousers
and
a
trenchcoat
and
had
a
mane
of
fair
hair
beneath
a
tight-fitting
beret
.
At
her
side
on
a
leash
trotted
a
small
,
smooth-haired
dog
.
Immediately
all
her
anxiety
vanished
.
Here
was
someone
who
would
help
her
push
the
car
into
the
side
of
the
road
,
who
would
know
in
which
direction
lay
the
nearest
house
,
who
would
be
a
companion
on
her
walk
.
Without
even
troubling
to
slam
the
door
of
the
car
she
called
out
happily
and
ran
smiling
towards
the
horror
of
her
death
.
The
dinner
had
been
excellent
and
the
wine
,
a
Château
Potensac
'78
,
an
interesting
choice
with
the
main
course
.
Although
Dalgliesh
knew
of
Alice
Mair
's
reputation
as
a
cookery
writer
he
had
never
read
any
of
her
books
and
had
no
idea
to
what
culinary
school
,
if
any
,
she
belonged
.
He
had
hardly
feared
being
presented
with
the
usual
artistic
creation
swimming
in
a
pool
of
sauce
and
accompanied
by
one
or
two
undercooked
carrots
and
mange-tout
elegantly
arranged
on
a
side
plate
.
But
the
wild
ducks
carved
by
Alex
Mair
had
been
recognizably
ducks
,
the
piquant
sauce
,
new
to
him
,
enhanced
rather
than
dominated
the
taste
of
the
birds
,
and
the
small
mounds
of
creamed
turnip
and
parsnip
were
an
agreeable
addition
to
green
peas
.
Afterwards
they
had
eaten
orange
sorbet
followed
by
cheese
and
fruit
.
It
was
a
conventional
menu
but
one
intended
,
he
felt
,
to
please
the
guests
rather
than
to
demonstrate
the
ingenuity
of
the
cook
.
The
expected
fourth
guest
,
Miles
Lessingham
,
had
unaccountably
failed
to
arrive
,
but
Alice
Mair
had
n't
rearranged
her
table
and
the
empty
chair
and
unfilled
wineglass
were
uncomfortably
evocative
of
Banquo
's
ghost
.
Dalgliesh
was
seated
opposite
Hilary
Robarts
.
The
portrait
,
he
thought
,
must
have
been
even
more
powerful
than
he
realized
if
it
could
so
dominate
his
physical
reaction
to
the
living
woman
.
It
was
the
first
time
they
had
met
although
he
had
known
of
her
existence
as
he
had
of
all
the
handful
of
people
who
lived
,
as
the
Lydsett
villagers
said
,
"
t'
other
side
of
the
gate
"
.
And
it
was
a
little
strange
that
this
was
their
first
meeting
;
her
red
Golf
was
a
frequent
sight
on
the
headland
,
her
cottage
had
frequently
met
Iris
eyes
from
the
top
storey
of
the
mill
.
Now
,
physically
close
for
the
first
time
,
he
found
it
difficult
to
keep
his
eyes
off
her
,
living
flesh
and
remembered
image
seeming
to
fuse
into
a
presence
both
potent
and
disturbing
.
It
was
a
handsome
face
,
a
model
's
face
,
he
thought
,
with
its
high
cheekbones
,
long
,
slightly
concave
nose
,
wide
,
full
lips
and
dark
,
angry
eyes
deeply
set
under
the
strong
brows
.
Her
crimped
,
springing
hair
,
held
back
with
two
combs
,
fell
over
her
shoulders
.
He
could
imagine
her
posed
,
mouth
moistly
open
,
hips
jutting
and
staring
at
the
cameras
with
that
apparently
obligatory
look
of
arrogant
resentment
.
As
she
leaned
forward
to
twitch
another
grape
from
the
bunch
and
almost
toss
it
into
her
mouth
he
could
see
the
faint
freckles
which
smudged
the
dark
forehead
,
the
glisten
of
hairs
above
a
carved
upper
lip
.
On
the
other
side
of
their
host
sat
Meg
Dennison
,
delicately
but
unfussily
peeling
her
grapes
with
pink-tipped
fingers
.
Hilary
Robarts
's
sultry
handsomeness
emphasized
her
own
very
different
look
,
an
old-fashioned
,
carefully
tended
but
unselfconscious
prettiness
which
reminded
him
of
photographs
of
the
late
thirties
.
Their
clothes
emphasized
the
contrast
.
Hilary
wore
a
shirtwaister
dress
in
multicoloured
Indian
cotton
,
three
buttons
at
the
neck
undone
.
Meg
Dennison
was
in
a
long
black
skirt
and
a
blue
patterned
silk
blouse
with
a
bow
at
the
neck
.
But
it
was
their
hostess
who
was
the
most
elegant
.
The
long
shift
in
fine
dark
brown
wool
worn
with
a
heavy
necklace
of
silver
and
amber
hid
her
angularity
and
emphasized
the
strength
and
regularity
of
the
strong
features
.
Beside
her
Meg
Dennison
's
prettiness
was
diminished
almost
to
insipidity
and
Hilary
Robarts
's
strong-coloured
cotton
looked
tawdry
.
The
room
in
which
they
were
dining
must
,
he
thought
,
have
been
part
of
the
original
cottage
.
From
these
smoke-blackened
beams
Agnes
Poley
had
hung
her
sides
of
bacon
,
her
bundles
of
dried
herbs
.
In
a
pot
slung
over
that
huge
hearth
she
had
cooked
her
family
's
meals
and
,
perhaps
,
at
the
end
had
heard
in
its
roaring
flames
the
crackling
faggots
of
her
dreadful
martyrdom
.
Outside
the
long
window
had
passed
the
helmets
of
marching
men
.
But
only
in
the
name
of
the
cottage
was
there
a
memory
of
the
past
.
The
oval
dining
table
and
the
chairs
were
modern
as
were
the
Wedgwood
dinner
service
and
the
elegant
glasses
.
In
the
drawing
room
,
where
they
had
drunk
their
pre-dinner
sherry
,
Dalgliesh
had
a
sense
of
a
room
which
deliberately
rejected
the
past
,
containing
nothing
which
could
violate
the
owner
's
essential
privacy
;
no
family
history
in
photograph
or
portrait
,
no
shabby
heirlooms
given
room
out
of
nostalgia
,
sentimentality
or
family
piety
,
no
antiques
collected
over
the
years
.
Even
the
few
pictures
,
three
recognizably
by
John
Piper
,
were
modern
.
The
furniture
was
expensive
,
comfortable
,
well
heart
of
the
cottage
was
n't
there
.
It
was
in
that
large
,
warm-smelling
and
welcoming
kitchen
.
He
had
only
been
half
listening
to
the
conversation
but
now
he
forced
himself
to
be
a
more
accommodating
guest
.
The
talk
was
general
,
candlelit
faces
leaned
across
the
table
and
the
hands
which
peeled
the
fruit
or
fidgeted
with
the
glasses
were
as
individual
as
the
faces
.
Alice
Mair
's
strong
but
elegant
hands
with
their
short
nails
,
Hilary
Robarts
's
long
,
knobbled
fingers
,
the
delicacy
of
Meg
Dennison
's
pink-tipped
fingers
,
a
little
reddened
with
housework
.
Alex
Mair
was
saying
:
"
All
right
,
let's
take
a
modern
dilemma
.
We
know
that
we
can
use
human
tissue
from
aborted
foetuses
to
treat
Parkinson
"
s
disease
and
probably
Alzheimer
's
.
Presumably
you
'd
find
that
ethically
acceptable
if
the
abortion
were
natural
or
legal
but
not
if
it
were
induced
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
tissue
.
But
you
can
argue
that
a
woman
has
a
right
to
the
use
that
she
makes
of
her
own
body
.
If
she
's
particularly
fond
of
someone
who
has
Alzheimer
's
and
wants
to
help
him
by
producing
a
foetus
,
who
has
the
right
to
say
no
?
A
foetus
is
n't
a
child
.
"
Hilary
Robarts
said
:
"
I
notice
that
you
assume
the
sufferer
to
be
helped
is
a
man
.
I
suppose
he
'd
feel
entitled
to
use
a
woman
's
body
for
this
purpose
as
he
would
any
other
.
But
why
the
hell
should
he
?
I
ca
n't
imagine
that
a
woman
who
's
actually
had
an
abortion
wants
to
go
through
that
again
for
any
man
's
convenience
.
"
The
words
were
spoken
with
extreme
bitterness
.
There
was
a
pause
then
Mair
said
quietly
:
"
Alzheimer
's
is
rather
more
than
an
inconvenience
.
But
I
'm
not
advocating
it
.
In
any
case
,
under
present
law
,
it
would
be
illegal
.
"
"
Would
that
worry
you
?
"
He
looked
into
her
angry
eyes
.
"
Naturally
it
would
worry
me
.
Happily
it
is
n't
a
decision
that
I
shall
ever
be
required
to
make
.
But
we
're
not
talking
about
legality
,
we
're
talking
about
morality
.
"
His
sister
asked
:
"
Are
they
different
?
"
"
That
's
the
question
,
is
n't
it
?
Are
they
,
Adam
?
"
It
was
the
first
time
he
had
used
Dalgliesh
's
Christian
name
.
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
You
're
assuming
there
's
an
absolute
morality
independent
of
time
or
circumstance
.
"
"
Would
n't
you
make
that
assumption
?
"
"
Yes
,
I
think
I
would
,
but
I
'm
not
a
moral
philosopher
.
"
Mrs
Dennison
looked
up
from
her
plate
a
little
flushed
and
said
:
"
I
'm
always
suspicious
of
the
excuse
that
a
sin
is
justified
if
it
's
done
to
benefit
someone
we
love
.
We
may
think
so
,
but
it
's
usually
to
benefit
ourselves
.
I
might
dread
the
thought
of
having
to
look
after
an
Alzheimer
patient
.
When
we
advocate
euthanasia
is
it
to
stop
pain
or
to
prevent
our
own
distress
at
having
to
watch
it
?
To
conceive
a
child
deliberately
in
order
to
kill
it
to
make
use
of
its
tissue
,
the
idea
is
absolutely
repugnant
.
"
Alex
Mair
said
:
"
I
could
argue
that
what
you
are
killing
is
n't
a
child
and
that
repugnance
at
an
act
is
n't
evidence
of
its
immorality
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
But
is
n't
it
?
Does
n't
Mrs
Dennison
's
natural
repugnance
tell
us
something
about
the
morality
of
the
act
?
"
She
gave
him
a
brief
,
grateful
smile
and
went
on
:
"
And
is
n't
this
use
of
a
foetus
particularly
dangerous
?
It
could
lead
to
the
poor
of
the
world
conceiving
children
and
selling
the
foetuses
to
help
the
rich
.
Already
I
believe
there
's
a
black
market
in
human
organs
.
Do
you
think
a
multi-millionaire
who
needs
a
heart-lung
transplant
ever
goes
without
?
"
Alex
Mair
smiled
.
"
As
long
as
you
are
n't
arguing
that
we
should
deliberately
suppress
knowledge
or
reject
scientific
progress
just
because
the
discoveries
can
be
abused
.
If
there
are
abuses
,
legislate
against
them
.
"
Meg
protested
:
"
But
you
make
it
sound
so
easy
.
If
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
legislate
against
social
evils
Mr
Dalgliesh
for
one
would
be
out
of
work
.
"
"
It
is
n't
easy
but
it
has
to
be
attempted
.
That
's
what
being
human
means
,
surely
,
using
our
intelligence
to
make
choices
.
"
Alice
Mair
got
up
from
the
table
.
She
said
:
"
Well
,
it
's
time
to
make
a
choice
now
on
a
somewhat
different
level
.
Which
of
you
would
like
coffee
and
what
kind
?
There
's
a
table
and
chairs
in
the
courtyard
.
I
thought
we
could
switch
on
the
yard
lights
and
have
it
outside
.
"
They
moved
through
to
the
drawing
room
and
Alice
Mair
opened
the
french
windows
leading
to
the
patio
.
Immediately
the
sonorous
booming
of
the
sea
flowed
into
and
took
possession
of
the
room
like
a
vibrating
and
irresistible
force
.
But
once
they
had
stepped
out
into
the
cool
air
,
paradoxically
,
the
noise
seemed
muted
,
the
sea
no
more
than
a
distant
roar
.
The
patio
was
bounded
on
the
road
side
by
a
high
flint
wall
which
,
to
the
south
and
east
,
curved
to
little
more
than
four
feet
to
give
an
unimpeded
view
across
the
headland
to
the
sea
.
The
coffee
tray
was
carried
out
by
Alex
Mair
within
minutes
and
,
cups
in
hand
,
the
little
party
wandered
aimlessly
among
the
terracotta
pots
like
strangers
reluctant
to
be
introduced
or
like
actors
on
a
stage
set
,
self-absorbed
,
pondering
their
lines
,
waiting
for
the
rehearsal
to
begin
.
They
were
without
coats
and
the
warmth
of
the
night
had
proved
illusory
.
They
had
turned
as
if
by
common
consent
to
go
back
into
the
cottage
when
the
lights
of
a
car
,
driven
fast
,
came
over
the
southern
rise
of
the
road
.
As
it
approached
its
speed
slackened
.
Mair
said
:
"
Lessingham
's
Porsche
.
"
No
one
spoke
.
They
watched
silently
as
the
car
was
driven
at
speed
off
the
road
to
brake
violently
on
the
turf
of
the
headland
.
as
if
conforming
to
some
prearranged
ceremony
they
grouped
themselves
into
a
semicircle
with
Alex
Mair
a
little
to
the
front
,
like
a
formal
welcoming
party
but
one
bracing
itself
for
trouble
rather
than
expecting
pleasure
from
the
approaching
guest
.
Dalgliesh
was
aware
of
the
heightening
tension
:
small
individual
tremors
of
anxiety
which
shivered
on
the
still
,
sea-scented
air
,
unified
and
focused
on
the
car
door
and
on
the
tall
figure
which
unwound
from
the
driver
's
seat
,
leapt
easily
over
the
low
stone
wall
and
walked
deliberately
across
the
courtyard
towards
them
.
Lessingham
ignored
Mair
and
moved
straight
to
Alice
.
He
took
her
hand
and
gently
kissed
it
,
a
theatrical
gesture
which
Dalgliesh
felt
had
taken
her
by
surprise
and
which
the
others
had
watched
with
an
unnaturally
critical
attention
.
Lessingham
said
gently
:
"
My
apologies
,
Alice
.
Too
late
for
dinner
,
I
know
,
but
not
,
I
hope
,
for
a
drink
.
And
God
,
do
I
need
one
.
"
"
Where
have
you
been
?
We
waited
dinner
for
forty
minutes
.
"
It
was
Hilary
Robarts
who
asked
the
obvious
question
,
sounding
as
accusatory
as
a
peevish
wife
.
Lessingham
kept
his
eye
on
Alice
.
He
said
:
"
I
've
been
considering
how
best
to
answer
that
question
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
.
There
are
a
number
of
interesting
and
dramatic
possibilities
.
I
could
say
that
I
've
been
helping
the
police
with
their
inquiries
.
Or
that
I
've
been
involved
in
a
murder
.
Or
that
there
was
a
little
unpleasantness
on
the
road
.
Actually
it
was
all
three
.
The
Whistler
has
killed
again
.
I
found
the
body
.
"
Hilary
Robarts
said
sharply
:
"
How
do
you
mean
,
"
found'
"
?
Where
?
"
Again
Lessingham
ignored
her
.
He
said
to
Alice
Mair
:
"
Could
I
have
that
drink
?
Then
I
'll
give
you
all
the
gory
details
.
After
unsettling
your
seating
plan
and
delaying
dinner
for
forty
minutes
that
's
the
least
I
owe
you
.
"
As
they
moved
back
into
the
drawing
room
Alex
Mair
introduced
Dalgliesh
.
Lessingham
gave
him
one
sharp
glance
.
They
shook
hands
.
The
palm
which
momentarily
touched
his
was
moist
and
very
cold
.
Alex
Mair
said
easily
:
"
Why
did
n't
you
ring
?
We
would
have
kept
some
food
for
you
.
"
The
question
,
conventionally
domestic
,
sounded
irrelevant
,
but
Lessingham
answered
it
.
"
Do
you
know
,
I
actually
forgot
.
Not
all
the
time
,
of
course
,
but
it
honestly
did
n't
cross
my
mind
until
the
police
had
finished
questioning
me
and
then
the
moment
did
n't
seem
opportune
.
They
were
perfectly
civil
but
I
sensed
that
my
private
engagements
had
a
pretty
low
priority
.
Incidentally
,
you
get
absolutely
no
credit
from
the
police
for
finding
a
body
for
them
.
Their
attitude
is
rather
,
"
'Thank
you
very
much
,
sir
,
very
nasty
,
I
'm
sure
.
Sorry
you
've
been
troubled
.
But
we
'll
take
over
now
.
Just
go
home
and
try
to
forget
all
about
it
.
'
"
I
have
a
feeling
that
that
is
n't
going
to
be
so
easy
.
"
Back
in
the
drawing
room
,
Alex
Mair
threw
a
couple
of
thin
logs
on
to
the
glowing
embers
and
went
to
get
the
drinks
.
Lessingham
had
refused
whisky
but
had
asked
for
wine
.
"
But
do
n't
waste
your
best
claret
on
me
,
Alex
.
This
is
purely
medicinal
.
"
Almost
imperceptibly
they
edged
their
chairs
closer
.
Lessingham
began
his
story
deliberately
,
pausing
at
times
to
take
gulps
of
the
wine
.
It
seemed
to
Dalgliesh
that
he
was
subtly
altered
since
his
arrival
,
had
become
charged
with
a
power
both
mysterious
and
oddly
familiar
.
He
thought
:
He
has
acquired
the
mystique
of
the
story-teller
and
,
glancing
at
the
ring
of
fire-lit
and
intent
faces
,
he
was
suddenly
reminded
of
his
first
village
school
,
of
the
children
clustered
round
Miss
Douglas
at
three
o'clock
on
a
Friday
afternoon
for
the
half
hour
of
story-time
,
and
felt
a
pang
of
pain
and
regret
for
those
lost
days
of
innocence
and
love
.
He
was
surprised
that
the
memory
should
have
come
back
so
keenly
and
at
such
a
moment
.
But
this
was
to
be
a
very
different
story
and
one
unsuited
to
the
ears
of
children
.
Lessingham
said
:
"
I
had
an
appointment
with
my
dentist
in
Norwich
at
five
o'clock
and
then
briefly
visited
a
friend
in
the
Close
.
So
I
drove
here
from
Norwich
,
not
from
my
cottage
.
I
'd
just
turned
right
off
the
B1
150
at
Fairstead
when
I
nearly
crashed
into
the
back
of
this
unlit
car
skewed
across
the
road
.
I
thought
it
was
a
damn
silly
place
to
park
if
someone
wanted
to
take
a
leak
in
the
bushes
.
Then
it
crossed
my
mind
that
there
could
have
been
an
accident
.
And
the
right-hand
door
was
open
,
that
seemed
a
bit
odd
.
So
I
drew
into
the
side
and
went
to
take
a
look
.
There
was
no
one
about
.
I
'm
not
sure
why
I
walked
into
the
trees
.
A
kind
of
instinct
I
suppose
.
It
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
and
I
wondered
whether
to
call
out
.
Then
I
felt
a
fool
and
decided
to
leave
it
and
mind
my
own
business
.
And
it
was
then
that
I
almost
tripped
over
her
.
"
He
took
another
gulp
of
the
wine
.
"
I
still
could
n't
see
anything
,
of
course
,
but
I
knelt
down
and
groped
about
with
my
hands
.
And
it
was
then
that
I
touched
flesh
.
I
think
I
touched
her
thigh
,
I
ca
n't
be
sure
.
But
flesh
,
even
dead
flesh
,
is
unmistakable
.
So
I
went
back
to
the
car
and
got
my
torch
.
I
shone
it
on
her
feet
and
then
slowly
up
her
body
to
her
face
.
And
then
,
of
course
,
I
saw
.
I
knew
it
was
the
Whistler
.
"
Meg
Dennison
asked
gently
:
"
Was
it
very
terrible
?
"
He
must
have
heard
in
her
voice
what
she
obviously
felt
,
not
prurience
but
sympathy
,
an
understanding
that
he
needed
to
talk
.
He
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
as
if
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
then
paused
,
giving
the
question
serious
thought
.
"
More
shocking
than
terrible
.
Looking
back
my
emotions
were
complicated
,
a
mixture
of
horror
,
disbelief
and
,
well
,
shame
.
I
felt
like
a
voyeur
.
The
dead
,
after
all
,
are
at
such
a
disadvantage
.
She
looked
grotesque
,
a
little
ridiculous
,
with
thin
clumps
of
hair
sticking
out
of
her
mouth
as
if
she
was
munching
.
Horrible
,
of
course
,
but
silly
at
the
same
time
.
I
had
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
giggle
.
I
know
it
was
only
a
reaction
to
shock
but
it
was
hardly
admirable
.
And
the
whole
scene
was
so
,
well
,
banal
.
If
you
had
asked
me
to
describe
one
of
the
Whistler
's
victims
that
's
exactly
how
I
should
have
seen
her
.
You
expect
reality
to
be
different
from
imaginings
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
Perhaps
because
the
imaginings
are
usually
worse
.
"
Meg
Dennison
said
gently
:
"
You
must
have
been
terrified
.
I
know
I
should
have
been
.
Alone
and
in
darkness
with
such
horror
.
"
He
shifted
his
body
towards
her
and
spoke
as
if
it
were
important
that
she
,
of
all
those
present
,
should
understand
.
"
No
,
not
terrified
,
that
was
the
surprising
part
.
I
was
frightened
,
of
course
,
but
only
for
a
second
or
two
.
After
all
,
I
did
n't
imagine
he
'd
wait
around
.
He
'd
had
his
kicks
.
He
is
n't
interested
in
men
anyway
.
I
found
myself
thinking
the
ordinary
,
commonplace
thoughts
.
I
must
n't
touch
anything
.
I
must
n't
destroy
the
evidence
.
I
've
got
to
get
the
police
.
Then
,
walking
back
to
the
car
,
I
started
rehearsing
what
I
'd
say
to
them
,
almost
as
if
I
were
concocting
my
story
.
I
tried
to
explain
why
it
was
that
I
went
into
the
bushes
,
tried
to
make
it
sound
reasonable
.
"
Alex
Mair
said
:
"
What
was
there
to
justify
?
You
did
what
you
did
.
It
sounds
reasonable
enough
to
me
.
The
car
was
a
danger
slewed
across
the
road
.
It
would
have
been
irresponsible
just
to
drive
on
.
"
"
It
seemed
to
need
a
lot
of
explaining
,
then
and
later
.
Perhaps
because
all
the
subsequent
police
sentences
began
with
"
why'
"
.
You
get
morbidly
sensitive
to
your
own
motives
.
It
's
almost
as
if
you
have
to
convince
yourself
that
you
did
n't
do
it
.
"
Hilary
Robarts
said
impatiently
:
"
But
the
body
,
when
you
first
went
back
for
the
torch
and
saw
her
,
you
were
certain
she
was
dead
?
"
"
Oh
yes
,
I
knew
she
was
dead
.
"
"
How
could
you
have
known
?
It
could
have
been
very
recent
.
Why
did
n't
you
at
least
try
to
resuscitate
her
,
give
her
the
kiss
of
life
?
It
would
have
been
worth
overcoming
your
natural
repugnance
.
"
Dalgliesh
heard
Meg
Dennison
make
a
small
sound
between
a
gasp
and
a
groan
.
Lessingham
looked
at
Hilary
and
said
coolly
:
"
It
would
have
been
if
there
had
been
the
slightest
point
in
it
.
I
knew
she
was
dead
,
let's
leave
it
at
that
.
But
do
n't
worry
,
if
I
ever
rind
you
in
extremis
I
'll
endeavour
to
overcome
my
natural
repugnance
.
"
Hilary
relaxed
and
gave
a
little
self-satisfied
smile
,
as
if
gratified
to
have
stung
him
into
a
cheap
retort
.
Her
voice
was
more
natural
as
she
said
:
"
I
'm
surprised
you
were
n't
treated
as
a
suspect
.
After
all
,
you
were
the
first
on
the
scene
,
and
this
is
the
second
time
you
've
been
,
well
almost
,
in
at
the
death
.
It
's
becoming
a
habit
.
"
The
last
words
were
spoken
almost
under
her
breath
but
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
Lessingham
's
face
.
He
met
her
glance
and
said
,
with
equal
quietness
:
"
But
there
's
a
difference
,
is
n't
there
?
I
had
to
watch
Toby
die
,
remember
?
And
this
time
no
one
will
even
try
to
pretend
that
it
is
n't
murder
.
"
The
fire
gave
a
sudden
crackle
and
the
top
log
rolled
over
and
fell
into
the
hearth
.
Mair
,
his
face
flushed
,
kicked
it
viciously
back
.
Hilary
Robarts
,
perfectly
calm
,
turned
to
Dalgliesh
.
"
But
I
'm
right
,
are
n't
I
?
Do
n't
the
police
usually
suspect
the
person
who
finds
the
body
?
"
He
said
quietly
:
"
Not
necessarily
.
"
Lessingham
had
placed
the
bottle
of
claret
on
the
hearth
.
Now
he
leaned
down
and
carefully
refilled
his
glass
.
He
said
:
"
They
might
have
suspected
me
,
I
suppose
,
but
for
a
number
of
lucky
circumstances
.
I
was
obviously
out
on
my
lawful
occasions
.
I
have
an
alibi
for
at
least
two
of
the
previous
killings
.
From
their
point
of
view
I
was
depressingly
free
of
blood
.
I
suppose
they
could
see
I
was
in
a
mild
state
of
shock
.
And
there
was
no
sign
of
the
ligature
which
strangled
her
,
nor
of
the
knife
.
"
Hilary
said
sharply
:
"
What
knife
?
The
Whistler
's
a
strangler
.
Everyone
knows
that
's
how
he
kills
.
"
"
Oh
,
I
did
n't
mention
that
,
did
I
?
She
was
strangled
all
right
,
or
I
suppose
she
was
.
I
did
n't
keep
the
torchlight
on
her
face
longer
than
was
necessary
.
But
he
marks
his
victims
,
apart
from
stuffing
their
mouths
with
hair
.
Pubic
hair
,
incidentally
.
I
saw
that
all
right
.
There
was
the
letter
L
cut
into
her
forehead
.
Quite
unmistakable
.
A
detective-constable
who
was
talking
to
me
later
told
me
that
it
's
one
of
the
Whistler
's
trademarks
.
He
thought
that
the
L
could
stand
for
Larksoken
and
that
the
Whistler
might
be
making
some
kind
of
statement
about
nuclear
power
,
a
protest
perhaps
.
"
Alex
Mair
said
sharply
:
"
That
's
nonsense
.
"
Then
added
more
calmly
:
"
There
's
been
nothing
on
television
or
in
the
papers
about
any
cut
on
the
victims
"
foreheads
.
"
The
police
are
keeping
it
quiet
,
or
trying
to
.
It
's
the
kind
of
detail
they
can
use
to
sort
out
the
false
confessions
.
There
have
been
half
a
dozen
of
those
already
apparently
.
There
's
been
nothing
in
the
media
about
the
hair
either
,
but
that
piece
of
unpleasantness
seems
to
be
generally
known
.
After
all
,
I
'm
not
the
only
one
to
have
found
a
body
.
People
do
talk
.
"
Hilary
Robarts
said
:
"
Nothing
has
been
written
or
said
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
about
it
being
pubic
hair
.
"
"
No
,
the
police
are
keeping
that
quiet
too
,
and
it
's
hardly
the
sort
of
detail
you
print
in
a
family
newspaper
.
Not
that
it
's
so
very
surprising
.
He
is
n't
a
rapist
but
there
was
bound
to
be
some
sexual
element
.
"
It
was
one
of
the
details
which
Rickards
had
told
Dalgliesh
the
previous
evening
but
one
,
he
felt
,
which
Lessingham
could
well
have
kept
to
himself
,
particularly
at
a
mixed
dinner
party
.
He
was
a
little
surprised
at
his
sudden
sensitivity
.
perhaps
it
was
his
glance
at
Meg
Dennison
's
ravaged
face
.
And
then
his
ears
caught
a
faint
sound
.
He
looked
across
to
the
open
door
of
the
dining
room
and
glimpsed
the
slim
figure
of
Theresa
Blaney
standing
in
the
shadows
.
He
wondered
how
much
of
Lessingham
's
account
she
had
heard
.
However
little
,
it
would
have
been
too
much
.
He
said
,
hardly
aware
of
the
severity
in
his
voice
:
'Did
n't
Chief
Inspector
Rickards
ask
you
to
keep
this
information
confidential
?
"
There
was
an
embarrassed
silence
.
He
thought
,
They
had
forgotten
for
a
moment
that
I
'm
a
policeman
.
Lessingham
turned
to
him
.
"
I
intend
to
keep
it
confidential
.
Rickards
did
n't
want
it
to
become
public
knowledge
and
it
wo
n't
.
No
one
here
will
pass
it
on
.
"
But
that
single
question
,
reminding
them
of
who
he
was
and
what
he
represented
,
chilled
the
room
and
changed
their
mood
from
fascinated
and
horrified
interest
to
a
slightly
embarrassed
unease
.
And
when
,
a
minute
later
,
he
got
up
to
say
his
goodbyes
and
thank
his
hostess
,
there
was
an
almost
visible
sense
of
relief
.
He
knew
that
the
embarrassment
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fear
that
he
would
question
,
criticize
,
move
like
a
spy
among
them
.
It
was
n't
his
case
and
they
were
n't
suspects
,
and
they
must
have
known
that
he
was
no
cheerful
extrovert
,
flattered
to
be
the
centre
of
attraction
while
they
bombarded
him
with
questions
about
Chief
Inspector
Rickards
's
likely
methods
,
the
chance
of
catching
the
Whistler
,
his
theories
about
psychopathic
killers
,
his
own
experience
of
serial
murder
.
But
merely
by
being
there
he
increased
their
awakening
fear
and
repugnance
at
this
latest
horror
.
On
each
of
their
minds
was
imprinted
the
mental
image
of
that
violated
face
,
the
half-open
mouth
stuffed
with
hair
,
those
staring
,
sightless
eyes
,
and
his
presence
intensified
the
picture
,
brought
it
into
sharper
focus
.
Horror
and
death
were
his
trade
and
,
like
an
undertaker
,
he
carried
with
him
the
contagion
of
his
craft
.
He
was
at
the
front
door
when
,
on
impulse
,
he
turned
back
and
said
to
Meg
Dennison
:
"
I
think
you
mentioned
that
you
walked
from
the
Old
Rectory
,
Mrs
Dennison
.
Could
I
walk
home
with
you
,
that
is
if
it
's
not
too
early
for
you
?
"
Alex
Mair
was
beginning
to
say
that
he
,
of
course
,
would
drive
her
but
Meg
extricated
herself
clumsily
from
her
chair
and
said
,
a
little
too
eagerly
:
"
I
'd
be
grateful
if
you
would
.
I
would
like
the
walk
and
it
would
save
Alex
getting
out
the
car
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
And
it
's
time
Theresa
was
on
her
way
.
We
should
have
driven
her
home
an
hour
ago
.
I
'll
give
her
father
a
ring
.
Where
is
she
,
by
the
way
?
"
Meg
said
:
"
I
think
she
was
next
door
clearing
the
table
a
minute
ago
.
"
Well
,
I
'll
find
her
and
Alex
can
drive
her
home
.
"
The
party
was
breaking
up
.
Hilary
Robarts
had
been
slumped
back
in
her
chair
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
Lessingham
.
Now
she
got
to
her
feet
and
said
:
"
I
'll
get
back
to
my
cottage
.
There
's
no
need
for
anyone
to
come
with
me
.
As
Miles
has
said
,
the
Whistler
's
had
his
kicks
for
tonight
.
"
Alex
Mair
said
:
"
I
'd
rather
you
waited
.
I
'll
walk
with
you
once
I
've
taken
Theresa
home
.
"
She
shrugged
and
,
without
looking
at
him
,
said
:
"
All
right
,
if
you
insist
.
I
'll
wait
.
"
She
moved
over
to
the
window
,
staring
out
into
the
darkness
.
Only
Lessingham
stayed
in
his
chair
,
reaching
again
to
fill
his
glass
.
Dalgliesh
saw
that
Alex
Mair
had
silently
placed
another
opened
bottle
in
the
hearth
.
He
wondered
whether
Alice
Mair
would
invite
Lessingham
to
stay
the
night
at
Martyr
's
Cottage
or
whether
he
would
be
driven
home
later
by
her
or
her
brother
.
He
would
certainly
be
in
no
state
to
drive
himself
.
Dalgliesh
was
helping
Meg
Dennison
into
her
jacket
when
the
telephone
rang
,
sounding
unnaturally
strident
in
the
quiet
room
.
He
felt
her
sudden
shock
of
fear
and
for
a
moment
,
almost
involuntarily
,
his
hands
strengthened
on
her
shoulders
.
They
heard
Alex
Mair
's
voice
.
"
Yes
,
we
've
heard
.
Miles
Lessingham
is
here
and
gave
us
the
details
.
Yes
,
I
see
.
Yes
.
Thank
you
for
letting
me
know
.
"
Then
there
was
a
longer
silence
,
then
Mair
's
voice
again
.
"
Completely
fortuitous
,
I
should
say
,
would
n't
you
?
After
all
,
we
have
a
staff
of
five
hundred
and
thirty
.
But
naturally
everyone
at
Larksoken
will
find
the
news
deeply
shocking
,
the
women
particularly
.
Yes
,
I
shall
be
in
my
office
tomorrow
if
there
's
any
help
I
can
give
.
Her
family
have
been
told
,
I
suppose
?
Yes
,
I
see
.
Good
night
,
Chief
Inspector
.
"
He
put
down
the
receiver
and
said
:
"
That
was
Chief
Inspector
Rickards
.
They
've
identified
the
victim
.
Christine
Baldwin
.
She
is
-
she
was
-
a
typist
at
the
station
.
You
did
n't
recognize
her
then
,
Miles
?
"
Lessingham
took
his
time
refilling
his
glass
.
He
said
:
The
police
did
n't
tell
me
who
she
was
.
Even
if
they
had
,
I
would
n't
have
remembered
the
name
.
And
no
,
Alex
,
I
did
n't
recognize
her
.
I
suppose
I
must
have
seen
Christine
Baldwin
at
Larksoken
,
probably
in
the
canteen
.
But
what
I
saw
earlier
tonight
was
n't
Christine
Baldwin
.
And
I
can
assure
you
that
I
did
n't
shine
the
torch
on
her
longer
than
I
needed
to
satisfy
myself
that
she
was
beyond
any
help
that
I
could
give
.
"
Without
looking
round
from
the
window
Hilary
Robarts
said
:
"
Christine
Baldwin
.
Aged
thirty-three
.
Actually
,
she
's
only
been
with
us
for
eleven
months
.
Married
last
year
.
Just
transferred
to
the
medical
physics
department
.
I
can
give
you
her
typing
and
shorthand
speeds
if
you
're
interested
.
"
Then
she
turned
round
and
looked
Alex
Mair
in
the
face
.
"
It
looks
as
if
the
Whistler
's
getting
closer
,
does
n't
it
,
in
more
ways
than
one
.
"
The
final
goodbyes
were
said
and
they
stepped
out
from
the
smell
of
wood
smoke
,
food
and
wine
from
a
room
which
Dalgliesh
was
beginning
to
find
uncomfortably
warm
into
the
fresh
,
sea-scented
air
.
It
took
a
few
minutes
before
his
eyes
had
adjusted
to
semi-darkness
and
the
great
sweep
of
the
headland
became
visible
,
its
shapes
and
forms
mysteriously
altered
under
the
high
stars
.
To
the
north
the
power
station
was
a
glittering
galaxy
of
white
lights
,
its
stark
geometric
bulk
subsumed
in
the
blue-black
of
the
sky
.
They
stood
for
a
moment
regarding
it
,
then
Meg
Dennison
said
:
"
When
I
first
came
here
from
London
it
almost
frightened
me
,
the
sheer
size
of
it
,
the
way
it
dominates
the
headland
.
But
I
'm
getting
used
to
it
.
It
's
still
disturbing
but
it
does
have
a
certain
grandeur
.
Alex
tries
to
demystify
it
,
says
its
function
is
just
to
produce
electricity
for
the
National
Grid
efficiently
and
cleanly
,
that
the
main
difference
between
this
and
any
other
power
station
is
that
you
do
n't
have
beside
it
a
huge
pyramid
of
polluting
coal
dust
.
But
atomic
power
to
my
generation
always
means
that
mushroom
cloud
.
And
now
it
means
Chernobyl
.
But
if
it
were
an
ancient
castle
standing
there
against
the
skyline
,
if
what
we
looked
out
at
tomorrow
morning
was
a
row
of
turrets
,
we
'd
probably
be
saying
how
magnificent
it
is
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
If
it
had
a
row
of
turrets
it
would
be
a
rather
different
shape
.
But
I
know
what
you
mean
.
I
should
prefer
the
headland
without
it
but
it
's
beginning
to
look
as
if
it
had
a
right
to
be
there
.
"
They
turned
simultaneously
from
contemplating
the
glittering
lights
and
looked
south
to
the
decaying
symbol
of
a
very
different
power
.
Before
them
,
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
,
crumbling
against
the
skyline
like
a
child
's
sandcastle
rendered
amorphous
by
the
advancing
tide
,
was
the
ruined
Benedictine
abbey
.
He
could
just
make
out
the
great
empty
arch
of
the
east
window
and
beyond
it
the
shimmer
of
the
North
Sea
while
above
,
seeming
to
move
through
and
over
it
like
a
censer
,
swung
the
smudged
yellow
disc
of
the
moon
.
Almost
without
conscious
will
they
took
their
first
steps
from
the
track
on
to
the
rough
headland
towards
it
.
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
Shall
we
?
Can
you
spare
the
time
?
And
what
about
your
shoes
?
"
"
Reasonably
sensible
.
Yes
,
I
'd
like
to
,
it
looks
so
wonderful
at
night
.
And
I
do
n't
really
need
to
hurry
.
The
Copleys
wo
n't
have
waited
up
for
me
.
Tomorrow
,
when
I
have
to
tell
them
how
close
the
Whistler
is
getting
,
I
may
not
like
to
leave
them
alone
after
dark
.
This
may
be
my
last
free
night
for
some
time
.
"
"
I
do
n't
think
they
'd
be
in
any
real
danger
as
long
as
you
lock
up
securely
.
So
far
all
his
victims
have
been
young
women
and
he
kills
out
of
doors
.
"
I
tell
myself
that
.
And
I
do
n't
think
they
'd
be
seriously
frightened
.
Sometimes
the
very
old
seem
to
have
moved
beyond
that
kind
of
fear
.
The
trivial
upsets
of
daily
living
assume
importance
but
the
big
tragedies
they
take
in
their
stride
.
But
their
daughter
is
constantly
ringing
up
to
suggest
they
go
to
her
in
Wiltshire
until
he
's
caught
.
They
do
n't
want
to
but
she
's
a
strong-minded
woman
and
very
insistent
,
and
if
she
telephones
after
dusk
and
I
'm
not
there
it
will
increase
the
pressure
on
them
.
"
She
paused
and
then
said
:
"
It
was
a
horrible
end
to
an
interesting
but
rather
strange
dinner
party
.
I
wish
Mr
Lessingham
had
kept
the
details
to
himself
,
but
I
suppose
it
helped
him
to
talk
about
it
,
especially
as
he
lives
alone
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
It
would
have
needed
superhuman
control
not
to
have
talked
about
it
.
But
I
wish
he
'd
omitted
the
more
salacious
details
.
"
"
It
will
make
a
difference
to
Alex
,
too
.
Already
some
of
the
women
staff
demand
to
be
escorted
home
after
the
evening
shifts
.
Alice
has
told
me
that
that
is
n't
going
to
be
easy
for
Alex
to
organize
.
They
'll
only
accept
a
male
escort
if
he
has
an
unbreakable
alibi
for
one
of
the
Whistler
murders
.
People
cease
to
be
rational
even
when
they
've
known
and
worked
with
someone
for
the
last
ten
years
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
Murder
does
that
,
particularly
this
kind
of
murder
.
Miles
Lessingham
mentioned
another
death
:
Toby
.
Was
that
the
young
man
who
killed
himself
at
the
station
?
I
seem
to
remember
a
paragraph
in
one
of
the
papers
.
"
"
It
was
an
appalling
tragedy
.
Toby
Gledhill
was
one
of
Alex
's
most
brilliant
young
scientists
.
He
broke
his
neck
by
throwing
himself
down
on
top
of
the
reactor
.
"
"
So
there
was
no
mystery
about
it
?
"
"
Oh
no
,
absolutely
none
,
except
why
he
did
it
.
Mr
Lessingham
saw
it
happen
.
I
'm
surprised
you
remember
it
.
There
was
very
little
about
it
in
the
national
press
.
Alex
tried
to
minimize
the
publicity
to
protect
his
parents
.
"
And
to
protect
the
power
station
,
thought
Dalgliesh
.
He
wondered
why
Lessingham
had
described
Gledhill
's
death
as
murder
but
he
did
n't
question
his
companion
further
.
The
allegation
had
been
spoken
so
quietly
that
he
doubted
whether
she
had
in
fact
heard
it
.
Instead
he
asked
:
"
Are
you
happy
living
on
the
headland
?
"
The
question
did
not
appear
to
surprise
her
but
it
did
surprise
him
,
as
did
the
very
fact
that
they
were
walking
so
companionably
together
.
She
was
curiously
restful
to
be
with
.
He
liked
her
quiet
gentleness
with
its
suggestion
of
underlying
strength
.
Her
voice
was
pleasant
and
voices
were
important
to
him
.
But
six
months
ago
none
of
this
would
have
been
enough
to
make
him
invite
her
company
for
longer
than
was
politely
necessary
.
He
would
have
escorted
her
back
to
the
Old
Rectory
and
then
,
a
minor
social
obligation
performed
,
turned
with
relief
to
walk
alone
to
the
abbey
,
drawing
his
solitude
around
him
like
a
cloak
.
That
solitude
was
still
essential
to
him
.
He
could
n't
tolerate
twenty-four
hours
in
which
the
greater
part
was
n't
spent
entirely
alone
.
But
some
change
in
himself
,
the
inexorable
years
,
success
,
the
return
of
his
poetry
,
perhaps
the
tentative
beginning
of
love
,
seemed
to
be
making
him
sociable
.
He
was
n't
sure
whether
this
was
something
to
be
welcomed
or
resisted
.
He
was
aware
that
she
was
giving
his
question
careful
thought
.
"
Yes
,
I
think
that
I
am
.
Sometimes
very
happy
.
I
came
here
to
escape
from
the
problems
of
my
life
in
London
and
,
without
really
meaning
to
,
I
came
as
far
east
as
I
could
get
.
"
"
And
found
yourself
confronting
two
different
forms
of
menace
,
the
power
station
and
the
Whistler
.
"
"
Both
frightening
because
both
mysterious
,
both
rooted
in
a
horror
of
the
unknown
.
But
the
menace
is
n't
personal
,
is
n't
directed
specifically
against
me
.
But
I
did
run
away
and
,
I
suppose
,
all
refugees
carry
with
them
a
small
burden
of
guilt
.
And
I
miss
the
children
.
Perhaps
I
should
have
stayed
and
fought
on
.
But
it
was
becoming
a
very
public
war
.
I
'm
not
suited
to
the
role
of
popular
heroine
of
the
more
reactionary
press
.
All
I
wanted
was
to
be
left
alone
to
get
on
with
the
job
I
'd
been
trained
for
and
loved
.
But
every
book
I
used
,
every
word
I
spoke
was
scrutinized
.
You
ca
n't
teach
in
an
atmosphere
of
rancorous
suspicion
.
In
the
end
I
found
I
could
n't
even
live
in
it
.
"
She
was
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
knew
who
she
was
;
but
then
anyone
who
had
read
the
papers
must
know
that
.
He
said
:
"
It
's
possible
to
fight
intolerance
,
stupidity
and
fanaticism
when
they
come
separately
.
When
you
get
all
three
together
it
's
probably
wiser
to
get
out
,
if
only
to
preserve
one
's
sanity
.
"
They
were
approaching
the
abbey
now
and
the
grass
of
the
headland
was
becoming
more
hillocky
.
She
stumbled
and
he
put
out
his
hand
to
steady
her
.
She
said
:
"
In
the
end
it
came
down
to
just
two
letters
.
They
insisted
that
the
blackboard
should
be
called
the
chalkboard
.
Black
or
chalk
.
I
did
n't
believe
,
I
still
do
n't
believe
that
any
sensible
person
,
whatever
his
colour
,
objects
to
the
word
blackboard
.
It
's
black
and
it
's
a
board
.
The
word
black
in
itself
ca
n't
be
offensive
.
I
'd
called
it
that
all
my
life
so
why
should
they
try
to
force
me
to
change
the
way
I
speak
my
own
language
?
And
yet
,
at
this
moment
,
on
this
headland
,
under
this
sky
,
this
immensity
,
it
all
seems
so
petty
.
Perhaps
all
I
did
was
to
elevate
trivia
into
a
principle
.
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
Agnes
Poley
would
have
understood
.
My
aunt
looked
up
the
records
and
told
me
about
her
.
She
went
to
the
stake
,
apparently
,
for
an
obstinate
adherence
to
her
own
uncompromising
view
of
the
universe
.
She
could
n't
accept
that
Christ
"
s
body
could
be
present
in
the
sacrament
and
at
the
same
time
physically
in
heaven
at
God
's
right
hand
.
It
was
,
she
said
,
against
common
sense
.
Perhaps
Alex
Mair
should
take
her
as
patron
of
his
power
station
,
a
quasi-saint
of
rationality
.
"
"
But
that
was
different
.
She
believed
her
immortal
soul
was
in
jeopardy
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
Who
knows
what
she
believed
?
I
think
she
was
probably
activated
by
a
divine
obstinacy
.
I
find
that
rather
admirable
.
"
Meg
said
:
"
I
think
Mr
Copley
would
argue
that
she
was
wrong
,
not
the
obstinacy
,
but
her
earthbound
view
of
the
sacrament
.
I
'm
not
really
competent
to
argue
about
that
.
But
to
die
horribly
for
your
own
common-sense
view
of
the
universe
is
rather
splendid
.
I
never
visit
Alice
without
standing
and
reading
that
plaque
.
It
's
my
small
act
of
homage
.
And
yet
I
do
n't
feel
her
presence
in
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
Do
you
?
"
"
Not
in
the
slightest
.
I
suspect
that
central
heating
and
modern
furniture
are
inimical
to
ghosts
.
Did
you
know
Alice
Mair
before
you
came
here
?
"
"
I
knew
no
one
.
I
answered
an
advertisement
by
the
Copleys
in
The
Lady
.
They
were
offering
free
accommodation
and
food
to
someone
who
would
do
what
they
described
as
a
little
gentle
housework
.
It
's
a
euphemism
for
dusting
,
but
of
course
it
never
works
out
like
that
.
Alice
has
made
a
great
difference
.
I
had
n't
realized
how
much
I
was
missing
female
friendship
.
At
school
we
only
had
alliances
,
offensive
or
defensive
.
Nothing
ever
cut
across
political
divisions
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
Agnes
Poley
would
have
understood
that
atmosphere
too
.
It
was
the
one
she
breathed
.
"
For
a
minute
they
walked
in
silence
hearing
the
rustle
of
the
long
grasses
over
their
shoes
.
Dalgliesh
wondered
why
it
was
that
,
when
walking
towards
the
sea
,
there
came
a
moment
when
its
roar
suddenly
increased
as
if
a
menace
,
quiescent
and
benign
,
had
suddenly
realized
and
gathered
up
its
power
.
Looking
up
at
the
sky
,
at
the
myriad
pinpricks
of
light
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
feel
the
turning
earth
beneath
his
feet
and
that
time
had
mysteriously
come
to
a
stop
,
fusing
into
one
moment
the
past
,
the
present
and
the
future
;
the
ruined
abbey
,
the
obstinately
enduring
artefacts
of
the
last
war
,
the
crumbling
cliff
defences
,
the
windmill
and
the
power
station
.
And
he
wondered
whether
it
was
in
such
a
disorientating
limbo
of
time
,
listening
to
the
ever-restless
sea
,
that
the
previous
owners
of
Martyr
's
Cottage
had
chosen
their
text
.
Suddenly
his
companion
stopped
and
said
:
"
There
"
s
a
light
in
the
ruins
.
Two
small
flashes
,
like
a
torch
.
"
They
stood
still
and
watched
in
silence
.
Nothing
appeared
.
She
said
,
almost
apologetically
:
"
I
'm
sure
I
saw
it
.
And
there
was
a
shadow
,
something
or
somebody
moving
against
the
eastern
window
.
You
did
n't
see
it
?
"
"
I
was
looking
at
the
sky
.
"
She
said
,
almost
with
a
note
of
regret
:
"
Well
,
it
's
gone
now
.
I
suppose
I
could
have
imagined
it
.
"
And
when
,
five
minutes
later
,
they
made
their
way
cautiously
over
the
humpy
grass
into
the
heart
of
the
ruins
there
was
no
one
and
nothing
to
be
seen
.
Without
speaking
they
walked
through
the
gap
of
the
east
window
and
on
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
saw
only
the
moon-bleached
beach
stretching
north
and
south
,
the
thin
fringe
of
white
foam
.
If
anyone
had
been
there
,
thought
Dalgliesh
,
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
for
concealment
behind
the
hunks
of
concrete
or
in
the
crevices
of
the
sandy
cliff
.
There
was
little
point
and
no
real
justification
in
attempting
to
give
chase
,
even
if
they
had
known
the
direction
in
which
he
had
disappeared
.
People
were
entitled
to
walk
alone
at
night
.
Meg
said
again
:
"
I
suppose
I
could
have
imagined
it
,
but
I
do
n't
think
so
.
Anyway
,
she
's
gone
now
.
"
"
She
?
"
"
Oh
yes
.
Did
n't
I
say
?
I
had
the
distinct
impression
it
was
a
woman
.
"
By
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
Alice
Mair
woke
with
a
small
despairing
cry
from
her
nightmare
,
the
wind
was
rising
.
She
stretched
out
her
hand
to
click
on
the
bedside
light
,
checked
her
watch
,
then
lay
back
,
panic
subsiding
,
her
eyes
staring
at
the
ceiling
while
the
terrible
immediacy
of
the
dream
began
to
fade
,
recognized
for
what
it
was
,
an
old
spectre
returning
after
all
these
years
,
conjured
up
by
the
events
of
the
night
and
by
the
reiteration
of
the
word
"
murder
"
which
,
since
the
Whistler
had
begun
Iris
work
,
seemed
to
murmur
sonorously
on
the
very
air
.
Gradually
she
reentered
the
real
world
,
manifested
in
the
small
noises
of
the
night
,
the
moan
of
the
wind
in
the
chimneys
,
the
smoothness
of
the
sheet
in
her
clutching
hands
,
the
unnaturally
loud
ticking
of
her
watch
and
,
above
all
,
in
that
oblong
of
pale
light
,
the
open
casement
and
the
drawn
curtains
which
gave
her
a
view
of
the
faintly
luminous
star-studded
sky
.
The
nightmare
needed
no
interpretation
.
It
was
merely
a
new
version
of
an
old
horror
,
less
tenable
than
the
dreams
of
childhood
,
a
more
rational
,
more
adult
terror
.
She
and
Alex
were
children
again
,
the
whole
family
living
with
the
Copleys
at
the
Old
Rectory
.
That
,
in
a
dream
,
was
n't
so
surprising
.
The
Old
Rectory
was
only
a
larger
,
less
pretentious
version
of
Sunnybank
-
ridiculously
named
since
it
had
stood
on
level
ground
and
no
sun
ever
seemed
to
penetrate
its
windows
.
Both
were
late
Victorian
,
built
in
solid
red
brick
,
both
had
a
strong
,
curved
door
under
a
high
,
peaked
porch
,
both
were
isolated
,
each
in
its
own
garden
.
In
the
dream
she
and
her
father
were
walking
together
through
the
shrubbery
.
He
was
carrying
his
billhook
and
was
dressed
as
he
was
on
that
last
dreadful
autumn
afternoon
,
a
singlet
stained
with
his
sweat
,
the
shorts
high
cut
,
showing
as
he
walked
the
bulge
of
the
scrotum
,
the
white
legs
,
matted
with
black
hair
from
the
knees
down
.
She
was
worried
because
she
knew
that
the
Copleys
were
waiting
for
her
to
cook
lunch
.
Mr
Copley
,
robed
in
cassock
and
billowing
surplice
,
was
impatiently
pacing
the
back
lawn
seeming
oblivious
to
their
presence
.
Her
father
was
explaining
something
to
her
in
that
overloud
,
careful
voice
which
he
used
to
her
mother
,
the
voice
which
said
:
"
I
know
you
are
too
stupid
to
understand
this
but
I
will
talk
slowly
and
loudly
and
hope
that
you
wo
n't
try
my
patience
too
far
.
"
He
said
:
"
Alex
wo
n't
get
the
job
now
.
I
'll
see
that
he
does
n't
.
They
wo
n't
appoint
a
man
who
's
murdered
his
own
father
.
"
And
as
he
spoke
he
swung
the
billhook
and
she
saw
that
its
tip
was
red
with
blood
.
Then
suddenly
he
turned
towards
her
,
eyes
blazing
,
lifted
it
,
and
she
felt
its
point
pierce
the
skin
of
her
forehead
,
and
the
sudden
spurt
of
blood
gushing
into
her
eyes
.
Now
wide
awake
,
and
breathing
as
if
she
had
been
running
,
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
brow
and
knew
that
the
cold
wetness
she
felt
was
sweat
not
blood
.
There
was
little
hope
of
falling
asleep
again
;
there
never
was
when
she
woke
in
the
early
hours
.
She
could
get
up
,
put
on
her
dressing
gown
,
go
downstairs
and
make
tea
,
correct
her
proofs
,
read
,
listen
to
the
BBC
World
Service
.
Or
she
could
take
one
of
her
sleeping
tablets
.
God
knew
they
were
powerful
enough
to
knock
her
into
oblivion
.
But
she
was
trying
to
wean
herself
off
them
and
to
give
in
now
would
be
to
acknowledge
the
potency
of
the
nightmare
.
She
would
get
up
and
make
tea
.
She
had
no
fear
of
waking
Alex
.
He
slept
soundly
,
even
through
the
winter
gales
.
But
first
there
was
a
small
act
of
exorcism
to
be
performed
.
If
the
dream
were
to
lose
its
power
,
if
she
were
somehow
to
prevent
it
recurring
,
she
must
face
again
the
memory
of
that
afternoon
nearly
thirty
years
ago
.
It
had
been
a
warm
autumnal
day
in
early
October
and
she
,
Alex
and
her
father
were
working
in
the
garden
.
He
was
Wearing
a
thick
hedge
of
brambles
and
overgrown
shrubs
at
the
bottom
of
the
shrubbery
and
out
of
sight
of
the
house
,
slashing
at
them
with
a
billhook
while
Alex
and
she
dragged
the
freed
branches
clear
ready
to
build
a
bonfire
.
Her
father
was
under
clad
for
the
time
of
year
but
was
sweating
heavily
.
She
saw
the
arm
lifting
and
falling
,
heard
the
crack
of
twigs
,
felt
again
the
thorns
cutting
her
fingers
,
heard
his
high
commands
.
And
then
,
suddenly
,
he
gave
a
cry
.
Either
the
branch
had
been
rotten
or
he
had
missed
his
aim
.
The
billhook
had
sliced
into
his
naked
thigh
and
,
turning
,
she
saw
the
great
curve
of
red
blood
begin
to
bubble
in
the
air
,
saw
him
slowly
sink
like
a
wounded
animal
,
his
hands
plucking
the
air
.
His
right
hand
dropped
the
billhook
and
he
held
it
out
to
her
,
shaking
,
palm
upward
,
and
looked
at
her
beseechingly
,
like
a
child
.
He
tried
to
speak
but
she
could
n't
make
out
the
words
.
She
was
moving
towards
him
,
fascinated
,
when
suddenly
she
felt
a
clutch
on
her
arm
laurels
towards
the
orchard
.
She
cried
:
"
Alex
,
stop
!
He
's
bleeding
.
He
's
dying
.
We
've
got
to
get
help
.
"
She
could
n't
remember
whether
she
actually
said
the
words
.
All
she
later
remembered
was
the
strength
of
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
as
he
forced
her
back
against
the
bark
of
an
apple
tree
and
held
her
there
,
imprisoned
.
And
he
spoke
a
single
word
.
"
No
.
"
Shaking
with
terror
,
her
heart
pounding
,
she
could
n't
have
broken
free
even
if
she
had
wanted
.
And
she
knew
now
that
this
powerlessness
was
important
to
him
.
It
had
been
his
act
and
his
alone
.
Compelled
,
absolved
,
she
had
been
given
no
choice
.
Now
,
thirty
years
later
,
lying
rigid
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
sky
,
she
remembered
that
single
word
,
his
eyes
looking
into
hers
,
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
,
the
bark
of
the
tree
scraping
her
back
through
her
Aertex
shirt
.
Time
seemed
to
stop
.
She
could
n't
remember
now
how
long
he
had
held
her
imprisoned
,
only
that
it
seemed
an
eternity
of
immeasurable
time
.
And
then
,
at
last
,
he
gave
a
sigh
and
said
:
"
All
right
.
We
can
go
now
.
"
And
that
,
too
,
amazed
her
,
that
he
should
have
been
thinking
so
clearly
,
calculating
how
long
it
would
take
.
He
dragged
her
after
him
until
they
stood
over
her
father
's
body
.
And
,
looking
down
at
the
still-outstretched
arm
,
the
glazed
and
open
eyes
,
the
great
scarlet
pool
soaking
into
the
earth
,
she
knew
that
it
was
a
body
,
that
he
had
gone
for
ever
,
that
there
was
nothing
she
need
fear
from
him
ever
again
.
Alex
turned
to
her
and
spoke
each
word
loudly
and
clearly
as
if
she
were
a
subnormal
child
.
"
Whatever
he
's
been
doing
to
you
,
he
wo
n't
do
it
again
.
Ever
.
Listen
to
me
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
happened
.
We
left
him
and
went
down
to
climb
the
apple
trees
.
Then
we
decided
that
we
'd
better
get
back
.
Then
we
found
him
.
That
's
all
there
is
,
it
's
as
simple
as
that
.
You
do
n't
need
to
say
anything
else
.
Just
leave
the
talking
to
me
.
Look
at
me
,
look
at
me
,
Alice
.
You
understand
?
"
Her
voice
,
when
it
came
,
sounded
like
an
old
woman
's
voice
,
cracked
and
tremulous
,
and
the
words
strained
her
throat
.
"
Yes
,
I
understand
.
"
And
then
he
was
dragging
her
by
the
hands
,
racing
across
the
lawn
,
nearly
pulling
her
arm
from
its
socket
,
crashing
through
the
kitchen
door
,
crying
aloud
so
that
it
sounded
like
a
whoop
of
triumph
.
She
saw
her
mother
's
face
draining
as
if
she
too
were
bleeding
to
death
,
heard
his
panting
voice
.
"
It
's
Father
.
He
's
had
an
accident
.
Get
a
doctor
quick
.
"
And
then
she
was
alone
in
the
kitchen
.
It
was
very
cold
.
There
were
cold
tiles
under
her
feet
.
The
surface
of
the
wooden
table
on
which
she
rested
her
head
was
cold
to
her
cheeks
.
No
one
came
.
She
was
aware
of
a
voice
telephoning
from
the
hall
,
and
other
voices
,
other
steps
.
Someone
was
crying
.
Now
there
were
more
footsteps
and
the
crunch
of
car
wheels
on
gravel
.
And
Alex
had
been
right
.
It
had
all
been
very
simple
.
No
one
had
questioned
her
,
no
one
had
been
suspicious
.
Their
story
had
been
accepted
.
She
did
n't
go
to
the
inquest
but
Alex
did
,
although
he
never
told
her
what
happened
there
.
Afterwards
some
of
the
people
concerned
,
their
family
doctor
,
the
solicitor
,
a
few
of
her
mother
's
friends
,
came
back
and
there
was
a
curious
tea
party
with
sandwiches
and
home-made
fruitcake
.
They
were
kind
to
her
and
Alex
.
Someone
actually
patted
her
head
.
A
voice
said
,
"
It
was
tragic
that
there
was
no
one
there
.
Common
sense
and
a
rudimentary
knowledge
of
first
aid
would
have
saved
him
.
"
But
now
the
memory
deliberately
evoked
had
completed
its
exorcism
.
The
nightmare
had
been
robbed
of
its
terror
.
With
luck
it
might
not
return
for
months
.
She
swung
her
legs
out
of
bed
and
reached
for
her
dressing
gown
.
She
had
just
poured
the
boiling
water
on
the
tea
and
was
standing
waiting
for
it
to
brew
when
she
heard
Alex
's
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
,
turning
,
she
saw
his
tall
figure
blocking
the
kitchen
door
.
He
looked
boyish
,
almost
vulnerable
,
in
the
familiar
corded
dressing
gown
.
He
pushed
both
hands
through
his
sleep-tousled
hair
.
Surprised
,
because
he
was
usually
a
sound
sleeper
,
she
said
:
"
Did
I
disturb
you
?
Sorry
.
"
"
No
,
I
woke
earlier
and
could
n't
get
off
again
.
Holding
dinner
for
Lessingham
made
it
too
late
for
comfortable
digestion
.
Is
this
fresh
?
"
"
About
ready
to
pour
.
"
He
took
down
a
second
mug
from
the
dresser
and
poured
tea
for
them
both
.
She
seated
herself
in
a
wicker
chair
and
took
her
mug
without
speaking
.
He
said
:
"
The
wind
's
rising
.
"
"
Yes
,
it
has
been
for
the
last
hour
.
"
He
went
over
to
the
door
and
unbolted
the
top
wooden
panel
,
pushing
it
open
.
There
was
a
sensation
of
rushing
white
coldness
,
scentless
,
but
obliterating
the
faint
tang
of
the
tea
and
she
heard
the
low
growling
roar
of
the
sea
.
As
she
listened
it
seemed
to
rise
in
intensity
so
that
she
could
imagine
,
with
an
agreeable
frisson
of
simulated
terror
,
that
the
low
friable
cliffs
had
finally
crumbled
and
that
the
white
foaming
turbulence
was
rolling
towards
them
across
Alex
's
face
.
Looking
at
him
as
he
stared
into
the
night
,
she
felt
a
surge
of
affection
as
pure
and
as
uncomplicated
as
the
flow
of
cold
air
against
her
face
.
Its
fleeting
intensity
surprised
her
.
He
was
so
much
a
part
of
her
that
she
never
needed
nor
wanted
to
examine
too
closely
the
nature
of
her
feeling
for
him
.
She
knew
that
she
was
always
quietly
satisfied
to
have
him
in
the
cottage
,
to
hear
his
footfalls
on
the
floor
above
,
to
share
with
him
the
meal
she
had
cooked
for
herself
at
the
end
of
the
day
.
And
yet
neither
made
demands
of
the
other
.
Even
his
marriage
had
made
no
difference
.
She
had
been
unsurprised
at
the
marriage
since
she
had
rather
liked
Elizabeth
,
but
equally
unsurprised
when
it
ended
.
She
thought
it
unlikely
that
he
would
marry
again
,
but
nothing
between
them
would
change
,
however
many
wives
entered
,
or
attempted
to
enter
,
his
life
.
Sometimes
as
now
she
would
smile
wryly
,
knowing
how
outsiders
saw
their
relationship
.
Those
who
assumed
that
the
cottage
was
owned
by
him
,
not
her
,
saw
her
as
the
unmarried
sister
,
dependent
on
him
for
houseroom
,
companionship
,
a
purpose
in
life
.
Others
,
more
perceptive
but
still
nowhere
near
the
truth
,
were
intrigued
by
their
apparent
independence
of
each
other
,
their
casual
comings
and
goings
,
their
non-involvement
.
She
remembered
Elizabeth
saying
in
the
first
weeks
of
her
engagement
to
Alex
,
"
Do
you
know
,
you
're
a
rather
intimidating
couple
?
"
and
she
had
been
tempted
to
reply
,
"
Oh
,
we
are
,
we
are
.
"
She
had
bought
Martyr
's
Cottage
before
his
appointment
as
Director
of
the
power
station
and
he
had
moved
in
by
an
unspoken
agreement
that
this
was
a
temporary
expedient
while
he
decided
what
to
do
,
keep
on
the
Barbican
flat
as
his
main
home
or
sell
the
flat
and
buy
a
house
in
Norwich
and
a
smaller
pied
a
terre
in
London
.
He
was
essentially
an
urban
creature
;
she
did
n't
see
him
settling
permanently
other
than
in
a
city
.
If
,
with
the
new
job
,
he
moved
back
to
London
she
would
n't
follow
him
,
and
nor
,
she
knew
,
would
he
expect
her
to
.
Here
on
this
sea-scoured
coast
she
had
at
last
found
a
place
which
she
was
content
to
call
home
.
That
he
could
walk
in
and
out
of
it
unannounced
never
made
it
less
than
her
own
.
It
must
,
she
thought
sipping
her
tea
,
have
been
after
one
o'clock
when
he
returned
from
seeing
Hilary
Robarts
home
.
She
wondered
what
had
kept
him
.
Sleeping
lightly
as
always
in
the
early
hours
,
she
had
heard
his
key
in
the
lock
,
his
foot
on
the
stairs
,
before
drifting
again
into
sleep
.
Now
it
was
getting
on
for
five
o'clock
.
He
could
n't
have
had
more
than
a
few
hours
"
sleep
.
Now
,
as
if
suddenly
aware
of
the
morning
chill
,
he
closed
the
top
half
of
the
door
,
drove
home
the
bolt
,
then
came
and
stretched
himself
out
in
the
armchair
opposite
her
.
Leaning
back
,
he
cradled
his
mug
in
his
hands
.
He
said
:
"
It
's
a
nuisance
that
Caroline
Amphlett
does
n't
want
to
leave
Larksoken
.
I
do
n't
relish
beginning
a
new
job
,
particularly
this
job
,
with
an
unknown
PA
.
Caroline
knows
the
way
I
work
.
I
'd
rather
taken
it
for
granted
that
she
'd
come
to
London
with
me
.
It
's
inconvenient
.
"
And
it
was
,
she
suspected
,
rather
more
than
inconvenient
.
Pride
,
even
personal
prestige
,
were
also
at
stake
.
Other
senior
men
took
their
personal
assistants
with
them
when
changing
jobs
.
The
reluctance
of
a
secretary
to
be
parted
from
her
boss
was
a
flattering
affirmation
of
personal
dedication
.
She
could
sympathize
with
his
chagrin
but
it
was
hardly
enough
to
keep
him
awake
at
night
.
He
added
:
"
Personal
reasons
,
or
so
she
says
.
That
means
Jonathan
Reeves
,
presumably
.
God
knows
what
she
sees
in
him
.
The
man
is
n't
even
a
good
technician
.
"
Alice
Mair
controlled
her
smile
.
She
said
:
'l
doubt
whether
her
interest
in
him
is
technical
.
"
"
Well
,
if
it
's
sexual
she
has
less
discrimination
than
I
gave
her
credit
for
.
"
He
was
n't
,
she
told
herself
,
a
poor
judge
of
men
or
women
.
He
rarely
made
fundamental
mistakes
and
never
,
she
suspected
,
about
a
man
's
scientific
ability
.
But
he
had
no
understanding
of
the
extraordinary
complexities
and
irrationalities
of
human
motives
,
human
behaviour
.
He
knew
that
the
universe
was
complex
but
that
it
obeyed
certain
rules
,
although
,
she
supposed
,
he
would
n't
have
used
the
word
"
obey
"
with
its
implication
of
conscious
choice
.
This
,
he
would
say
,
is
how
the
physical
world
behaves
.
It
is
open
to
human
reason
and
,
to
a
limited
extent
,
to
human
control
.
People
disconcerted
him
because
they
could
surprise
him
.
Most
disconcerting
of
all
was
the
fact
that
he
occasionally
surprised
himself
.
He
would
have
been
at
home
as
a
sixteenth-century
Elizabethan
,
categorizing
people
according
to
their
essential
natures
;
choleric
,
melancholic
,
mercurial
,
saturnine
,
qualities
mirroring
the
planets
that
governed
their
birth
.
That
basic
fact
established
,
then
you
knew
where
you
were
.
And
yet
it
could
still
surprise
him
that
a
man
could
be
a
sensible
and
reliable
scientist
in
his
work
and
a
fool
with
women
,
could
show
judgement
in
one
area
of
his
life
and
act
like
an
irrational
child
in
another
.
Now
he
was
peeved
because
his
secretary
,
whom
he
had
categorized
as
intelligent
,
sensible
,
dedicated
,
preferred
to
stay
in
Norfolk
with
her
lover
,
a
man
he
despised
,
rather
than
follow
him
to
London
.
She
said
:
"
I
thought
you
said
once
that
you
found
Caroline
sexually
cold
.
"
"
Did
I
?
Surely
not
.
That
would
suggest
a
degree
of
personal
experience
.
I
think
I
said
I
could
n't
imagine
ever
finding
her
physically
attractive
.
A
PA
who
is
personable
and
highly
efficient
but
not
sexually
tempting
is
the
ideal
.
"
She
said
drily
:
"
I
imagine
that
a
man
's
idea
of
the
ideal
secretary
is
a
woman
who
manages
to
imply
that
she
would
like
to
go
to
bed
with
her
boss
but
nobly
restrains
herself
in
the
interests
of
office
efficiency
.
What
will
happen
to
her
?
"
"
Oh
,
her
job
's
secure
.
If
she
wants
to
stay
at
Larksoken
there
will
be
plenty
of
competition
to
get
her
.
She
's
intelligent
as
well
as
tactful
and
efficient
.
"
"
But
presumably
not
ambitious
,
else
why
should
she
be
content
to
remain
at
Larksoken
?
"
She
added
:
"
Caroline
may
have
another
reason
for
wanting
to
stay
in
the
area
.
I
saw
her
in
Norwich
Cathedral
about
three
weeks
ago
.
She
met
a
man
in
the
Lady
Chapel
.
They
were
very
discreet
but
it
looked
to
me
like
an
assignation
.
"
He
asked
,
but
without
real
curiosity
:
"
What
kind
of
man
?
"
"
Middle-aged
.
Nondescript
.
Difficult
to
describe
.
But
he
was
too
old
to
be
Jonathan
Reeves
.
"
She
said
no
more
,
knowing
that
he
was
n't
particularly
interested
,
that
his
mind
had
moved
elsewhere
.
And
yet
,
looking
back
,
it
had
been
an
odd
encounter
.
Caroline
's
blonde
hair
had
been
bundled
under
a
large
beret
and
she
was
wearing
spectacles
.
But
the
disguise
,
if
it
were
meant
as
a
disguise
,
had
been
ineffective
.
She
herself
had
moved
on
swiftly
,
anxious
not
to
be
recognized
or
to
seem
a
spy
.
A
minute
later
she
had
seen
the
girl
slowly
walking
along
the
aisle
,
guidebook
in
hand
,
the
man
strolling
behind
her
carefully
distanced
.
They
had
moved
together
and
had
stood
in
front
of
a
monument
,
seemingly
absorbed
.
And
when
,
ten
minutes
later
,
Alice
was
leaving
the
cathedral
she
had
glimpsed
him
again
.
This
time
it
was
he
who
was
carrying
the
guidebook
.
He
made
no
further
comment
about
Caroline
but
after
a
minute
's
silence
he
said
:
'Not
a
particularly
successful
dinner
party
.
"
"
An
understatement
.
Beta-minus
,
except
,
of
course
,
for
the
food
.
What
's
the
matter
with
Hilary
?
Is
she
actually
trying
to
be
disagreeable
or
is
she
merely
unhappy
?
"
"
People
usually
are
when
they
ca
n't
get
what
they
want
.
"
"
In
her
case
,
you
.
"
He
smiled
into
the
empty
fire
grate
but
did
n't
reply
.
After
a
moment
she
said
:
"
Is
she
likely
to
be
a
nuisance
?
"
"
Rather
more
than
a
nuisance
.
She
's
likely
to
be
dangerous
.
"
"
Dangerous
?
How
dangerous
?
You
mean
dangerous
to
you
personally
?
"
"
To
rather
more
than
me
.
"
"
But
nothing
you
ca
n't
cope
with
?
"
"
Nothing
I
ca
n't
cope
with
.
But
not
by
making
her
Administrative
Officer
.
She
'd
be
a
disaster
.
I
should
never
have
appointed
her
in
an
acting
capacity
.
"
"
When
are
you
making
the
appointment
?
"
"
In
ten
days
"
time
.
There
's
a
good
field
.
"
"
So
you
've
got
ten
days
to
decide
what
to
do
about
her
.
"
"
Rather
less
than
that
.
She
wants
a
decision
by
Sunday
.
"
A
decision
about
what
?
she
wondered
.
Her
job
,
a
possible
promotion
,
her
future
life
with
Alex
?
But
surely
the
woman
could
see
that
she
had
no
future
with
Alex
.
She
asked
,
knowing
the
importance
of
the
question
,
knowing
,
too
,
that
only
she
would
dare
ask
it
,
"
Will
you
be
very
disappointed
if
you
do
n't
get
the
job
?
"
"
I
'll
be
aggrieved
,
which
is
rather
more
destructive
of
one
's
peace
of
mind
.
I
want
it
,
I
need
it
and
I
'm
the
right
person
for
it
.
I
suppose
that
's
what
every
candidate
thinks
but
in
my
case
it
happens
to
be
true
.
It
's
an
important
job
,
Alice
.
One
of
the
most
important
there
is
.
The
future
lies
with
nuclear
power
,
if
we
're
going
to
save
this
planet
,
but
we
've
got
to
manage
it
better
,
nationally
and
internationally
.
"
"
I
imagine
you
're
the
only
serious
candidate
.
Surely
this
is
the
kind
of
appointment
which
they
only
decide
to
make
when
they
know
they
've
got
the
right
man
available
.
It
"
s
a
new
job
.
They
've
managed
perfectly
well
without
a
nuclear
supremo
up
to
now
.
I
can
see
that
,
given
the
right
man
,
the
job
has
immense
possibilities
.
But
in
the
wrong
hands
it
's
just
another
public
relations
job
,
a
waste
of
public
money
.
"
He
was
too
intelligent
not
to
know
that
she
was
reassuring
him
.
She
was
the
only
person
from
whom
he
ever
needed
reassurance
or
would
ever
take
it
.
He
said
:
"
There
's
a
suspicion
that
we
could
be
getting
into
a
mess
.
They
want
someone
to
get
us
out
of
it
.
Minor
matters
like
his
precise
powers
,
who
he
'll
be
responsible
to
and
how
much
he
'll
be
paid
have
yet
to
be
decided
.
That
's
why
they
're
taking
so
long
over
the
job
specification
.
"
She
said
:
"
You
do
n't
need
a
written
job
specification
to
know
what
they
're
looking
for
.
A
respected
scientist
,
a
proven
administrator
and
a
good
public
relations
expert
.
They
'll
probably
ask
you
to
take
a
TV
test
.
Looking
good
on
the
box
seems
to
be
the
prerequisite
for
anything
these
days
.
"
"
Only
for
future
presidents
or
prime
ministers
.
I
do
n't
think
they
'll
go
that
far
.
"
He
glanced
at
the
clock
.
"
It
's
already
dawn
.
I
think
I
'll
get
a
couple
of
hours
"
sleep
.
"
But
it
was
an
hour
later
before
they
finally
parted
and
went
to
their
rooms
.
Dalgliesh
waited
until
Meg
had
unlocked
the
front
door
and
stepped
inside
before
saying
his
final
goodnight
,
and
she
stood
for
a
moment
watching
his
tall
figure
striding
down
the
gravel
path
and
into
the
darkness
.
Then
she
passed
into
the
square
,
tessellated
hall
with
its
stone
fireplace
,
the
hall
which
,
on
winter
nights
,
seemed
to
echo
faintly
with
the
childish
voices
of
Victorian
rectors
'
children
and
which
,
for
Meg
,
had
always
held
a
faintly
ecclesiastical
smell
.
Folding
her
coat
over
the
ornate
wooden
newel
post
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
she
went
through
to
the
kitchen
and
the
last
task
of
the
day
,
setting
out
the
Copleys
'
early-morning
tray
.
It
was
a
large
,
square
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
archaic
when
the
Copleys
had
bought
the
Old
Rectory
and
unaltered
since
.
Against
the
left-hand
wall
stood
an
old-fashioned
gas
stove
so
heavy
that
Meg
was
unable
to
move
it
to
clean
behind
it
and
preferred
not
to
think
of
the
accumulated
grease
of
decades
gumming
it
to
the
wall
.
Under
the
window
was
deep
porcelain
sink
stained
with
the
detritus
of
seventy
years
'
washing-up
and
impossible
to
clean
adequately
.
The
floor
was
of
ancient
stone
slabs
,
hard
on
the
feet
,
from
which
in
winter
there
seemed
to
rise
a
damp
,
foot-numbing
miasma
.
The
wall
opposite
the
sink
and
the
window
was
covered
with
an
oak
dresser
,
very
old
and
probably
valuable
,
if
it
had
been
possible
to
remove
it
from
the
wall
without
its
collapse
,
and
the
original
row
of
bells
still
hung
over
the
door
each
with
its
Gothic
script
;
drawing
room
,
dining
room
,
study
,
nursery
.
It
was
a
kitchen
to
challenge
rather
than
enhance
the
skills
of
any
cook
ambitious
beyond
the
boiling
of
eggs
.
But
now
Meg
hardly
noticed
its
deficiencies
.
Like
the
rest
of
the
Old
Rectory
it
had
become
home
.
After
the
stridency
and
aggression
of
the
school
,
the
hate-mail
,
she
was
happy
to
find
her
temporary
asylum
in
this
gentle
household
where
voices
were
never
raised
,
where
no
one
obsessively
analysed
her
every
sentence
in
the
hope
of
detecting
racist
,
sexist
or
fascist
undertones
,
where
words
meant
what
they
had
meant
for
generations
,
where
obscenities
were
unknown
or
at
least
unspoken
,
where
there
was
the
grace
of
good
order
symbolized
for
her
in
Mr
Copley
's
reading
of
the
Church
's
daily
offices
,
Morning
Prayer
and
Evensong
.
Sometimes
she
saw
the
three
of
them
as
expatriates
,
stranded
in
some
remote
colony
,
obstinately
adhering
to
old
customs
,
a
lost
way
of
life
,
as
they
did
to
old
forms
of
worship
.
And
she
had
grown
to
like
both
her
employers
.
She
would
have
respected
Simon
Copley
more
if
he
had
been
less
prone
to
venial
selfishness
,
less
preoccupied
with
his
physical
comfort
,
but
this
she
told
herself
was
probably
the
result
of
fifty
years
of
spoiling
by
a
devoted
wife
.
And
he
loved
his
wife
.
He
relied
on
her
.
He
respected
her
judgement
.
How
lucky
they
were
,
she
thought
;
secure
in
each
other
's
affection
and
presumably
fortified
in
increasing
age
by
the
certainty
that
if
they
were
n't
granted
the
grace
of
death
on
the
same
day
there
would
be
no
lasting
separation
.
But
did
they
really
believe
this
?
She
would
like
to
have
asked
them
,
but
knew
that
it
would
have
been
impossibly
presumptuous
.
Surely
they
must
have
some
doubts
,
made
some
mental
reservations
to
the
creed
they
so
confidently
recited
morning
and
night
.
But
perhaps
what
mattered
at
eighty
was
habit
,
the
body
no
longer
interested
in
sex
,
the
mind
no
longer
interested
in
speculation
,
the
smaller
things
in
life
mattering
more
than
the
large
and
,
in
the
end
,
the
slow
realization
that
nothing
really
mattered
at
all
.
The
job
was
n't
arduous
,
but
she
knew
that
gradually
she
was
taking
on
much
more
than
the
advertisement
had
suggested
and
she
sensed
that
the
main
anxiety
of
their
life
was
whether
she
would
stay
.
Their
daughter
had
provided
all
the
labour-saving
devices
:
dishwasher
,
washing
machine
,
spin-dryer
,
all
housed
in
a
disused
still
room
near
the
back
door
,
although
until
she
came
the
Copleys
had
been
reluctant
to
use
them
in
case
they
could
n't
turn
them
off
,
visualizing
the
machines
whirling
away
all
night
,
overheating
,
blowing
up
,
the
whole
rectory
pulsating
with
an
uncontrollable
power
.
Their
only
child
lived
in
a
manor
house
in
Wiltshire
and
rarely
visited
,
although
she
telephoned
frequently
,
usually
at
inconvenient
times
.
It
was
she
who
had
interviewed
Meg
for
the
Old
Rectory
and
Meg
now
found
it
difficult
to
connect
that
confident
,
tweeded
,
slightly
aggressive
woman
with
the
two
gentle
old
people
she
knew
.
And
she
knew
,
although
they
would
never
have
dreamt
of
telling
her
,
perhaps
did
n't
even
admit
it
to
themselves
,
that
they
were
afraid
of
her
.
She
bullied
them
,
as
she
would
have
claimed
,
for
their
own
good
.
Their
second
greatest
fear
was
that
they
might
be
forced
to
comply
with
her
frequently
telephoned
suggestion
,
made
purely
from
a
sense
of
duty
,
that
they
should
go
to
stay
with
her
until
the
Whistler
was
caught
.
Unlike
their
daughter
,
Meg
could
understand
why
,
after
retirement
,
they
had
used
all
their
savings
to
buy
the
rectory
and
had
in
old
age
burdened
themselves
with
a
mortgage
.
Mr
Copley
had
in
youth
been
a
curate
at
Larksoken
when
the
Victorian
church
was
still
standing
.
It
was
in
that
ugly
repository
of
polished
pine
,
acoustic
tiles
and
garish
,
sentimental
stained
glass
that
he
and
his
wife
had
been
married
,
and
in
a
flat
in
the
rectory
,
living
above
the
parish
priest
,
that
they
had
made
their
first
home
.
The
church
had
been
partly
demolished
by
a
devastating
gale
in
the
1930s
,
to
the
secret
relief
of
the
Church
Commissioners
who
had
been
considering
what
to
do
with
a
building
of
absolutely
no
architectural
merit
serving
a
congregation
at
the
major
festivals
of
six
at
the
most
.
So
the
church
had
been
finally
demolished
and
the
Old
Rectory
,
sheltering
behind
it
and
proving
more
durable
,
had
been
sold
.
Rosemary
Duncan-Smith
had
made
her
views
plain
when
driving
Meg
back
to
Norwich
station
after
her
interview
.
"
It
's
ridiculous
for
them
to
be
living
there
at
all
,
of
course
.
They
should
have
looked
for
a
two-bedded
,
well-equipped
flat
in
Norwich
or
in
a
convenient
village
close
to
the
shops
and
post
office
,
and
to
a
church
,
of
course
.
But
Father
can
be
remarkably
obstinate
when
he
thinks
he
knows
what
he
wants
and
Mother
is
putty
in
his
hands
.
I
hope
you
are
n't
seeing
this
job
as
a
temporary
expedient
.
"
Meg
had
replied
:
"
Temporary
,
but
not
short-term
.
I
ca
n't
promise
that
I
'll
stay
permanently
,
but
I
need
time
and
peace
to
decide
on
my
future
.
And
I
may
not
suit
your
parents
.
"
"
Time
and
peace
.
We
'd
all
be
glad
of
that
.
Well
,
I
suppose
it
's
better
than
nothing
,
but
I
'd
be
grateful
for
a
month
or
two
's
notice
when
you
do
decide
to
go
.
And
I
should
n't
worry
about
suiting
.
With
an
inconvenient
house
and
stuck
out
on
that
headland
with
nothing
to
look
at
but
a
ruined
abbey
and
that
atomic
power
station
they
'll
have
to
put
up
with
what
they
can
get
.
"
But
that
had
been
sixteen
months
ago
and
she
was
still
here
.
But
it
was
in
that
beautifully
designed
and
equipped
,
but
comfortable
and
homely
kitchen
at
Martyr
's
Cottage
that
she
had
found
her
healing
.
Early
in
their
friendship
,
when
Alice
had
to
spend
a
week
in
London
and
Alex
was
away
,
she
had
given
Meg
one
of
her
spare
keys
to
the
cottage
so
that
she
could
go
in
to
collect
and
forward
her
post
.
On
her
return
,
when
Meg
offered
it
back
,
she
had
said
:
"
Better
keep
it
.
You
may
need
it
again
.
"
Meg
had
never
again
used
it
.
The
door
was
usually
open
in
summer
and
,
when
shut
,
she
would
always
ring
.
But
its
possession
,
the
sight
and
weight
of
it
on
her
key
ring
,
had
come
to
symbolize
for
her
the
certainty
and
the
trust
of
their
friendship
.
She
had
been
so
long
without
a
woman
friend
.
She
had
forgotten
,
sometimes
she
told
herself
,
that
she
had
never
before
known
the
comfort
of
a
close
,
undemanding
,
asexual
companionship
with
another
woman
.
Before
the
accidental
drowning
of
her
husband
four
years
earlier
,
she
and
Martin
had
needed
only
the
occasional
companionship
of
friendly
acquaintances
to
affirm
their
self-sufficiency
.
Theirs
had
been
one
of
those
childless
,
self-absorbing
marriages
which
unconsciously
repel
attempts
at
intimacy
.
The
occasional
dinner
party
was
a
social
duty
;
they
could
hardly
wait
to
get
back
to
the
seclusion
of
their
own
small
house
.
And
after
his
death
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
walked
in
darkness
like
an
automaton
through
a
deep
and
narrow
canyon
of
grief
in
which
all
her
energies
,
all
her
physical
strength
,
had
been
husbanded
to
get
through
each
day
.
She
thought
and
worked
and
grieved
only
for
a
day
at
a
time
.
To
allow
herself
even
to
think
of
the
days
,
the
weeks
,
the
months
or
years
stretching
ahead
would
have
been
to
precipitate
disaster
.
For
two
years
she
had
hardly
been
sane
.
Even
her
Christianity
was
of
little
help
.
She
did
n't
reject
it
,
but
it
had
become
irrelevant
,
its
comfort
only
a
candle
which
served
fitfully
to
illumine
the
dark
.
But
when
,
after
those
two
years
,
the
valley
had
almost
imperceptibly
widened
and
there
was
for
the
first
time
,
not
those
black
enclosing
cliffs
,
but
the
vista
of
a
normal
life
,
even
of
happiness
,
a
landscape
over
which
it
was
possible
to
believe
the
sun
might
shine
,
she
had
become
unwittingly
embroiled
in
the
racial
politics
of
her
school
.
The
older
members
of
staff
had
moved
or
retired
,
and
the
new
headmistress
,
specifically
appointed
to
enforce
the
fashionable
orthodoxies
,
had
moved
in
with
crusading
zeal
to
smell
out
and
eradicate
heresy
.
Meg
realized
now
that
she
had
,
from
the
first
,
been
the
obvious
,
the
predestined
victim
.
She
had
fled
to
this
new
life
on
the
headland
and
to
a
different
solitude
.
And
here
she
had
found
Alice
Mair
.
They
had
met
a
fortnight
after
Meg
's
arrival
when
Alice
had
called
at
the
Old
Rectory
with
a
suitcase
of
jumble
for
the
annual
sale
in
aid
of
St
Andrew
's
Church
in
Lydsett
.
There
was
an
unused
scullery
leading
off
a
passage
between
the
kitchen
and
the
back
door
which
was
used
as
a
collecting
point
for
unwanted
items
from
the
headland
;
clothes
,
bric-a-brac
,
books
and
old
magazines
.
Mr
Copley
took
an
occasional
service
at
St
Andrew
's
when
Mr
Smollett
,
the
vicar
,
was
on
holiday
,
an
involvement
in
church
and
village
life
which
,
Meg
suspected
,
was
as
important
to
him
as
it
was
to
the
church
.
Normally
,
little
jumble
could
be
expected
from
the
few
cottages
on
the
headland
,
but
Alex
Mair
,
anxious
to
associate
the
power
station
with
the
community
,
had
put
up
a
notice
on
the
staff
board
and
the
two
tea
chests
were
usually
fairly
full
by
the
time
the
October
sale
came
round
.
The
back
door
of
the
Old
Rectory
,
giving
access
to
the
scullery
,
was
normally
left
open
during
daylight
hours
and
an
inner
door
to
the
house
locked
,
but
Alice
Mair
had
knocked
at
the
front
door
and
made
herself
known
.
The
two
women
,
close
in
age
,
both
reserved
,
both
independent
,
neither
deliberately
seeking
a
friend
,
had
liked
each
other
.
The
next
week
Meg
had
received
an
invitation
to
dinner
at
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
And
now
there
was
rarely
a
day
when
she
did
n't
walk
the
half
mile
over
the
headland
to
sit
in
Alice
's
kitchen
and
talk
and
watch
while
she
worked
.
Her
colleagues
at
school
would
,
she
knew
,
have
found
their
friendship
incomprehensible
.
Friendship
there
,
or
what
passed
for
friendship
,
never
crossed
the
great
divide
of
political
allegiance
and
in
the
acrimonious
clamour
of
the
staffroom
could
swiftly
deteriorate
into
gossip
,
rumours
,
recriminations
and
betrayal
.
This
peaceable
friendship
,
asking
nothing
,
was
as
devoid
of
intensity
as
it
was
of
anxiety
.
It
was
not
a
demonstrative
friendship
;
they
had
never
kissed
,
had
never
indeed
touched
hands
except
at
that
first
meeting
.
Meg
was
n't
sure
what
it
was
that
Alice
valued
in
her
,
but
she
knew
what
she
valued
in
Alice
.
Intelligent
,
well-read
,
unsentimental
,
unshockable
,
she
had
become
the
focus
of
Meg
's
life
on
the
headland
.
She
seldom
saw
Alex
Mair
.
During
the
day
he
was
at
the
power
station
and
at
weekends
,
reversing
the
normal
peregrination
,
he
was
at
his
London
flat
,
frequently
staying
there
for
Part
of
the
week
if
he
had
a
meeting
in
town
.
She
had
never
felt
that
Alice
had
deliberately
kept
them
apart
,
fearing
that
her
brother
would
be
bored
by
her
friend
.
In
spite
of
all
the
traumas
of
the
last
four
years
Meg
's
inner
self
was
too
confidently
rooted
to
be
prone
to
that
kind
of
sexual
or
social
self-abasement
.
But
she
had
never
felt
at
home
with
him
,
perhaps
because
,
with
his
confident
good
looks
and
the
air
of
arrogance
in
his
bearing
,
he
seemed
both
to
represent
and
to
have
absorbed
something
of
the
mystery
and
potency
of
the
power
he
operated
.
He
was
perfectly
amiable
to
her
on
the
few
occasions
when
they
did
meet
;
sometimes
she
even
felt
that
he
liked
her
.
But
their
only
common
ground
was
in
the
kitchen
of
Martyr
's
Cottage
and
even
there
she
was
always
more
at
home
when
he
was
away
.
Alice
never
spoke
of
him
except
casually
but
on
the
few
occasions
,
like
last
night
's
dinner
party
,
when
she
had
seen
them
together
they
seemed
to
have
the
intuitive
mutual
awareness
,
an
instinctive
response
to
the
other
's
needs
,
more
typical
of
a
long-standing
successful
marriage
than
of
an
apparently
casual
fraternal
relationship
.
And
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
three
years
she
had
been
able
to
talk
about
Martin
.
She
remembered
that
July
day
,
the
kitchen
door
open
to
the
patio
,
the
scent
of
herbs
and
sea
stronger
even
than
the
spicy
,
buttery
smell
of
newly
baked
biscuits
.
She
and
Alice
had
sat
opposite
each
other
,
across
the
kitchen
table
,
the
teapot
between
them
.
She
could
remember
every
word
.
"
He
did
n't
get
many
thanks
.
Oh
,
they
said
how
heroic
he
was
and
the
headmaster
said
all
the
right
things
at
the
school
memorial
service
.
But
they
thought
that
the
boys
should
n't
have
been
swimming
there
anyway
.
The
school
disclaimed
any
responsibility
for
his
death
.
They
were
more
anxious
to
escape
criticism
than
to
honour
Martin
.
And
the
boy
he
saved
has
n't
turned
out
very
well
.
I
suppose
I
'm
silly
to
worry
about
that
.
"
"
It
would
be
perfectly
natural
to
hope
that
your
husband
had
n't
died
for
someone
second-rate
,
but
I
suppose
the
boy
has
a
point
of
view
.
It
could
be
an
awesome
responsibility
knowing
that
someone
has
died
for
you
.
"
Meg
said
:
"
I
tried
to
tell
myself
that
.
For
a
time
I
was
-
well
,
almost
obsessed
with
that
boy
.
I
used
to
hang
about
the
school
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
.
Sometimes
I
had
the
need
almost
to
touch
him
.
It
was
as
if
some
part
of
Martin
had
Passed
into
him
.
But
he
was
only
embarrassed
,
of
course
.
He
did
n't
want
to
see
me
or
talk
to
me
,
he
or
his
parents
.
He
was
n't
,
in
fact
,
a
very
nice
boy
,
a
bully
and
rather
stupid
.
I
do
n't
think
Martin
even
liked
him
although
he
never
said
so
.
He
was
spotty
,
too
-
oh
dear
,
that
was
n't
his
fault
,
I
do
n't
know
why
I
even
mentioned
it
.
"
And
she
had
wondered
how
it
was
she
was
speaking
of
him
at
all
.
for
the
first
time
after
all
these
years
.
And
that
business
about
her
obsession
with
him
;
she
had
never
mentioned
that
to
a
living
soul
.
Alice
had
said
:
"
It
's
a
pity
your
husband
did
n't
leave
him
to
drown
and
save
himself
,
but
I
suppose
that
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
did
n't
weigh
up
the
relative
value
of
a
useful
teaching
career
and
pimpled
stupidity
.
"
"
Leave
him
to
drown
?
Deliberately
?
Oh
Alice
,
you
know
you
could
n't
do
that
yourself
.
"
"
Perhaps
not
.
I
'm
perfectly
capable
of
irrational
folly
.
I
'd
probably
pull
him
out
if
I
could
do
it
without
too
much
danger
to
myself
.
"
"
Of
course
you
would
.
It
's
human
instinct
,
surely
,
to
save
others
,
particularly
a
child
.
"
"
It
's
human
instinct
,
and
a
thoroughly
healthy
one
in
my
view
,
to
save
oneself
.
That
's
why
,
when
people
do
n't
,
we
call
them
heroes
and
give
them
medals
.
We
know
they
're
acting
against
nature
.
I
ca
n't
understand
how
you
can
have
such
an
extraordinarily
benign
view
of
the
universe
.
"
"
Have
I
?
I
suppose
I
have
.
Except
for
the
two
years
after
Martin
drowned
I
've
always
been
able
to
believe
that
at
the
heart
of
the
universe
there
is
love
.
"
"
At
the
heart
of
the
universe
there
is
cruelty
.
We
are
predators
and
are
preyed
upon
,
every
living
thing
.
Did
you
know
that
wasps
lay
their
eggs
in
ladybirds
,
piercing
the
weak
spot
in
their
armour
?
Then
the
grub
grows
and
feeds
on
the
living
ladybird
and
eats
its
way
out
,
tying
the
ladybird
's
legs
together
.
Whoever
thought
of
that
has
,
you
have
to
admit
,
a
peculiar
sense
of
humour
.
And
do
n't
quote
Tennyson
at
me
.
"
"
Perhaps
it
does
n't
feel
anything
,
the
ladybird
.
"
"
Well
,
it
"
s
a
comforting
thought
but
I
would
n't
bet
on
it
.
You
must
have
had
an
extraordinarily
happy
childhood
.
"
"
Oh
,
I
did
,
I
did
!
I
was
lucky
.
I
would
have
liked
brothers
and
sisters
but
I
do
n't
remember
that
I
was
ever
lonely
.
There
was
n't
much
money
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
love
.
"
"
Love
.
Is
that
so
very
important
?
You
were
a
teacher
,
you
ought
to
know
.
Is
it
?
"
"
It
's
vital
.
If
a
child
has
it
for
the
first
ten
years
hardly
anything
else
matters
.
If
he
has
n't
,
then
nothing
does
.
"
There
had
been
a
moment
's
silence
and
then
Alice
had
said
:
"
My
father
died
,
killed
in
an
accident
when
I
was
fifteen
.
"
"
How
terrible
.
What
kind
of
accident
?
Were
you
there
?
Did
you
see
it
?
"
"
He
cut
an
artery
with
a
billhook
.
He
bled
to
death
.
No
,
we
did
n't
see
it
,
but
we
were
on
the
scene
soon
afterwards
.
Too
late
,
of
course
.
"
"
Alex
too
,
and
he
was
even
younger
.
How
awful
for
you
both
.
"
"
It
had
its
effect
on
our
lives
undoubtedly
,
particularly
mine
.
Why
do
n't
you
try
one
of
those
biscuits
?
It
's
a
new
recipe
but
I
'm
not
sure
that
it
's
entirely
successful
.
A
little
too
sweet
,
and
I
may
have
overdone
the
spice
.
Tell
me
what
you
think
.
"
Recalled
to
the
present
by
the
cold
of
the
flagstones
numbing
her
feet
and
automatically
aligning
the
cup
handles
,
she
suddenly
realized
why
she
had
remembered
that
summer
teatime
in
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
The
biscuits
she
would
add
to
the
tray
next
morning
were
a
later
batch
of
the
same
recipe
provided
by
Alice
.
But
she
would
n't
take
them
from
the
tin
until
tomorrow
.
There
was
nothing
more
to
do
tonight
except
to
fill
her
hot-water
bottle
.
There
was
no
central
heating
in
the
Old
Rectory
and
she
seldom
switched
on
the
two-bar
electric
fire
in
her
bedroom
,
knowing
how
worried
the
Copleys
were
by
their
her
bills
.
Finally
,
hugging
the
bottle
's
warmth
to
her
chest
,
she
checked
on
the
bolts
of
the
front
and
back
doors
and
made
her
way
up
the
uncarpeted
stairs
to
bed
.
On
the
landing
she
met
Mrs
Copley
,
dressing-gowned
,
scurrying
furtively
to
the
bathroom
.
Although
there
was
a
cloakroom
on
the
ground
floor
the
Old
Rectory
had
only
one
bathroom
,
a
defect
which
necessitated
embarrassed
,
low-voiced
inquiries
before
anyone
upset
their
carefully
worked
out
rota
by
taking
an
unexpected
bath
.
Meg
waited
until
she
heard
the
main
bedroom
door
shut
before
going
herself
to
the
bathroom
.
Fifteen
minutes
later
she
was
in
bed
.
She
knew
rather
than
felt
that
she
was
very
tired
and
recognized
the
symptoms
of
an
overstimulated
brain
in
an
exhausted
body
,
the
restless
limbs
and
inability
to
get
comfortable
.
The
Old
Rectory
was
too
far
inland
for
her
to
hear
the
crash
of
the
waves
but
the
smell
and
the
throb
of
the
sea
were
always
present
.
In
summer
the
headland
would
vibrate
with
a
gentle
rhythmic
humming
which
,
on
stormy
nights
or
at
the
spring
tides
would
rise
to
an
angry
moan
.
She
slept
always
with
her
window
open
and
would
drift
into
sleep
soothed
by
that
distant
murmur
.
But
tonight
it
had
no
power
to
lull
her
into
unconsciousness
.
Her
bedside
book
,
often
reread
,
was
Anthony
Trollope
's
The
Small
House
at
Allington
but
tonight
it
could
no
longer
translate
her
to
the
reassuring
,
comfortable
,
nostalgic
world
of
Barsetshire
,
to
croquet
on
Mrs
Dale
's
lawn
and
dinner
at
the
squire
's
table
.
The
memories
of
the
evening
were
too
traumatic
,
too
exciting
,
too
recent
to
be
easily
assuaged
by
sleep
.
She
opened
her
eyes
to
the
darkness
,
a
darkness
too
often
populated
before
sleep
by
those
familiar
,
reproachful
,
childish
faces
,
brown
,
black
and
white
,
bending
over
her
,
asking
why
she
had
deserted
them
when
they
loved
her
and
thought
that
she
had
loved
them
.
Usually
it
was
a
relief
to
be
free
of
those
gentle
and
accusing
ghosts
,
which
in
the
last
few
months
had
visited
her
less
often
.
And
sometimes
they
were
replaced
by
a
more
traumatic
memory
.
The
headmistress
had
tried
to
insist
that
she
go
on
a
racial
awareness
course
,
she
who
had
taught
children
of
different
races
for
over
twenty
years
.
There
was
one
scene
which
for
months
she
had
tried
resolutely
to
put
out
of
her
mind
,
that
last
meeting
in
the
staffroom
,
the
circle
of
implacable
faces
,
brown
,
black
and
white
,
the
accusing
eyes
,
the
insistent
questions
.
And
in
the
end
,
worn
down
by
bullying
,
she
had
found
herself
helplessly
weeping
.
No
nervous
breakdown
,
that
useful
euphemism
,
had
been
more
humiliating
.
But
tonight
even
that
shameful
memory
was
replaced
by
more
recent
and
more
disquieting
visions
.
She
glimpsed
again
that
girlish
figure
momentarily
outlined
against
the
walls
of
the
abbey
only
to
slip
away
like
a
wraith
and
be
lost
among
the
shadows
of
the
beach
.
She
sat
again
at
the
dinner
table
and
saw
in
the
candlelight
Hilary
Robarts
's
dark
,
discontented
eyes
staring
intently
at
Alex
Mair
;
watched
the
planes
of
Miles
Lessingham
's
face
fitfully
lit
by
the
leaping
flames
of
the
fire
,
saw
his
long-fingered
hands
reaching
down
for
the
bottle
of
claret
,
heard
again
that
measured
rather
high
voice
speaking
the
unspeakable
.
And
then
,
on
the
verge
of
sleep
,
she
was
crashing
with
him
through
the
bushes
of
that
dreadful
wood
,
feeling
the
briars
scratching
her
legs
,
the
low
twigs
whipping
against
her
cheeks
,
staring
with
him
as
the
pool
of
light
from
the
torch
shone
down
on
that
grotesque
and
mutilated
face
.
And
in
that
twilight
world
between
waking
and
sleeping
she
saw
that
it
was
a
face
she
knew
,
her
own
.
she
jerked
back
to
consciousness
with
a
little
cry
of
began
resolutely
to
read
.
Half
an
hour
later
,
the
book
slipped
out
of
her
hand
and
she
fell
into
the
first
of
the
night
's
uneasy
periods
of
slumber
.
It
took
only
two
minutes
of
lying
stretched
and
rigid
on
his
bed
for
Alex
Mair
to
realize
that
sleep
was
unlikely
to
come
.
To
lie
in
bed
wakeful
had
always
been
intolerable
to
him
.
He
could
manage
with
little
sleep
but
that
was
invariably
sound
.
Now
he
swung
his
legs
out
of
bed
,
reached
for
his
dressing
gown
and
walked
over
to
the
window
.
He
would
watch
the
sun
rise
over
the
North
Sea
.
He
thought
back
over
the
last
few
hours
,
the
acknowledged
relief
of
talking
to
Alice
,
the
knowledge
that
nothing
shocked
her
,
nothing
surprised
her
,
that
everything
he
did
,
if
not
right
in
her
eyes
,
was
judged
by
a
different
standard
from
the
one
she
rigorously
applied
to
the
rest
of
her
life
.
The
secret
that
lay
between
them
,
those
minutes
when
he
had
held
her
shaking
body
against
the
tree
trunk
and
stared
into
her
eyes
,
compelling
obedience
,
had
bound
them
with
a
cord
so
strong
that
it
could
n't
be
frayed
,
either
by
the
enormity
of
their
shared
guilty
secret
,
or
by
the
small
rubs
of
living
together
.
And
yet
they
had
never
spoken
of
their
father
's
death
.
He
did
n't
know
whether
Alice
ever
thought
of
it
,
or
whether
the
trauma
had
erased
it
from
her
mind
so
that
she
now
believed
the
version
he
had
formulated
,
had
taken
the
lie
into
her
unconscious
and
made
it
her
truth
.
When
,
quite
soon
after
the
funeral
,
seeing
how
calm
she
was
,
he
had
imagined
that
possibility
he
had
been
surprised
at
his
reluctance
to
believe
it
.
He
did
n't
want
her
gratitude
.
It
was
degrading
even
to
contemplate
that
she
would
feel
an
obligation
towards
him
.
Obligation
and
gratitude
were
words
they
had
never
needed
to
use
.
But
he
did
want
her
to
know
and
to
remember
.
The
deed
was
to
him
so
monstrous
,
so
surprising
,
that
it
would
have
been
intolerable
not
to
have
shared
it
with
a
living
soul
.
In
those
early
months
he
had
wanted
her
to
know
the
magnitude
of
what
he
had
done
and
that
he
had
done
it
for
her
.
And
then
,
six
weeks
after
the
funeral
,
he
had
suddenly
found
himself
able
to
believe
that
it
had
n't
happened
,
not
in
that
way
,
and
that
the
whole
horror
was
a
childhood
fantasy
.
He
would
lie
awake
at
night
and
see
his
father
's
crumbling
figure
,
the
leap
of
blood
like
a
scarlet
fountain
,
would
hear
the
harshly
whispered
words
.
In
this
revised
and
comforting
version
there
had
been
a
second
of
delay
,
no
more
,
and
then
he
had
raced
for
the
house
shouting
for
help
.
And
there
was
a
second
and
even
more
admirable
fantasy
in
which
he
had
knelt
at
his
father
's
side
,
had
pressed
his
clenched
fist
hard
into
the
groin
,
quenching
the
spurting
blood
,
had
whispered
reassurance
into
those
dying
eyes
.
It
had
been
too
late
,
of
course
;
but
he
had
tried
.
He
had
done
his
best
.
The
coroner
had
praised
him
,
that
precise
little
man
with
his
half-moon
spectacles
,
his
face
like
a
querulous
parrot
.
"
I
congratulate
the
deceased
's
son
who
acted
with
commendable
promptness
and
courage
and
did
everything
possible
to
try
to
save
his
father
's
life
.
"
The
relief
of
being
able
to
believe
in
his
innocence
was
at
first
so
great
that
temporarily
it
overwhelmed
him
.
He
had
lain
in
bed
night
after
night
drifting
into
sleep
on
a
tide
of
euphoria
.
But
he
had
known
,
even
then
,
that
this
self-administered
absolution
was
like
a
drug
in
the
bloodstream
.
It
was
comforting
and
easy
,
but
it
was
n't
for
him
.
That
way
lay
a
danger
more
destructive
even
than
guilt
.
He
had
told
himself
:
"
I
must
never
believe
that
a
lie
is
the
truth
.
I
may
tell
lies
all
my
life
if
it
's
expedient
but
I
must
know
them
for
what
they
are
and
I
must
never
tell
them
to
myself
.
Facts
are
facts
.
I
have
to
accept
them
and
face
them
and
then
I
can
learn
how
to
deal
with
them
.
I
can
look
for
reasons
for
what
I
did
and
call
those
reasons
excuses
;
what
he
did
to
Alice
,
how
he
bullied
Mother
,
how
I
hated
him
.
I
can
attempt
to
justify
his
death
at
least
to
myself
.
But
I
did
what
I
did
and
he
died
as
he
died
.
"
And
with
that
acceptance
came
a
kind
of
peace
.
After
a
few
years
he
was
able
to
believe
that
guilt
itself
was
an
indulgence
,
that
he
did
n't
need
to
suffer
it
unless
he
chose
.
And
then
there
came
a
time
when
he
felt
a
pride
in
the
deed
,
in
the
courage
,
the
audacity
,
the
resolution
which
had
made
it
possible
.
But
that
,
too
,
he
knew
was
dangerous
.
And
for
years
afterwards
he
hardly
thought
of
his
father
.
Neither
his
mother
nor
Alice
ever
spoke
of
him
except
in
the
company
of
casual
acquaintances
who
felt
the
need
to
utter
embarrassed
condolences
from
which
there
was
no
escape
.
But
in
the
family
only
once
was
his
name
mentioned
.
A
year
after
the
death
his
mother
had
married
Edmund
Morgan
,
a
widowed
church
organist
of
mind-numbing
dullness
,
and
had
retired
with
him
to
Bognor
Regis
where
they
lived
on
his
father
's
insurance
money
in
a
spacious
bungalow
in
sight
of
the
sea
,
in
an
obsessive
mutual
devotion
which
mirrored
the
meticulous
order
and
tidiness
of
their
world
.
His
mother
always
spoke
of
her
new
husband
as
Mr
Morgan
.
"
If
I
do
n't
talk
to
you
about
your
father
,
Alex
,
it
is
n't
that
I
've
forgotten
him
,
but
Mr
Morgan
would
n't
like
it
.
"
The
phrase
had
become
a
catchword
between
him
and
Alice
.
The
conjunction
of
Morgan
's
job
and
his
instrument
offered
endless
possibilities
of
adolescent
jokes
,
particularly
when
he
and
-their
mother
were
on
honeymoon
.
"
I
expect
Mr
Morgan
is
pulling
out
all
Iris
stops
.
"
"
Do
you
suppose
Mr
Morgan
is
changing
his
combinations
?
"
"
Poor
Mr
Morgan
,
labouring
away
.
I
hope
he
does
n't
run
out
of
wind
.
"
They
were
wary
,
reticent
children
,
yet
this
joke
would
reduce
them
to
screams
of
helpless
laughter
.
Mr
Morgan
and
his
organ
releasing
them
into
hysterical
laughter
had
anaesthetized
the
horror
of
the
past
.
And
then
,
when
he
was
about
eighteen
,
reality
of
another
kind
intruded
itself
and
he
said
aloud
,
"
I
did
n't
do
it
for
Alice
,
I
did
it
for
myself
"
,
and
thought
how
extraordinary
it
was
that
it
had
taken
four
years
to
discover
that
fact
.
And
yet
was
it
a
fact
,
was
it
the
truth
,
or
was
it
merely
a
psychological
speculation
which
in
certain
moods
he
found
it
interesting
to
contemplate
?
Now
,
looking
out
over
the
heartland
to
the
eastern
sky
already
flushed
with
the
first
faint
gold
of
dawn
,
he
said
aloud
:
"
I
let
my
father
die
deliberately
.
That
is
a
fact
.
All
the
rest
is
pointless
speculation
.
"
In
fiction
,
he
thought
,
Alice
and
I
should
have
been
tormented
by
our
joint
knowledge
,
distrustful
,
guilt-ridden
,
unable
to
live
apart
yet
miserable
together
.
Yet
since
his
father
's
death
there
had
been
nothing
between
him
and
his
sister
but
companionship
,
affection
,
peace
.
But
now
,
nearly
thirty
years
later
,
when
he
thought
he
had
long
come
to
terms
with
the
deed
and
his
own
reaction
to
it
,
memory
had
begun
to
stir
again
.
It
had
started
with
the
first
Whistler
murder
.
The
word
"
murder
"
itself
constantly
on
someone
's
lips
,
like
a
sonorous
curse
,
seemed
to
have
the
power
to
evoke
those
half-suppressed
images
of
his
father
's
face
which
had
become
as
unclear
,
as
devoid
of
any
life
,
as
an
old
photograph
.
But
in
the
last
six
months
his
father
's
image
had
begun
to
intrude
on
his
consciousness
at
odd
moments
,
in
the
middle
of
a
meeting
,
across
a
boardroom
table
,
in
a
gesture
,
the
droop
of
an
eyelid
,
the
tone
of
a
voice
,
the
line
of
a
speaker
's
mouth
,
the
shape
of
fingers
splayed
to
an
open
fire
.
His
father
's
ghost
had
returned
in
the
tangle
of
late-summer
foliage
,
the
first
fall
of
the
leaves
,
the
tentative
autumn
smells
.
He
wondered
if
the
same
thing
was
happening
to
Alice
.
For
all
their
mutual
sympathy
,
for
all
the
sense
he
had
of
their
being
irrevocably
bound
together
,
this
was
the
one
question
he
knew
he
would
never
ask
.
And
there
were
other
questions
,
one
question
in
particular
,
which
he
had
no
need
to
fear
from
her
.
She
was
n't
in
the
least
curious
about
his
sexual
life
.
He
knew
enough
psychology
to
have
at
least
some
insight
into
what
those
early
shaming
and
terrifying
experiences
had
done
to
her
.
Sometimes
he
thought
that
she
regarded
his
affairs
with
a
casual
,
slightly
amused
indulgence
as
if
,
herself
immune
to
a
childish
weakness
,
she
was
nevertheless
indisposed
to
criticize
it
in
others
.
Once
,
after
his
divorce
,
she
had
said
:
'l
find
it
extraordinary
that
a
straightforward
if
inelegant
device
for
ensuring
the
survival
of
the
species
should
involve
human
beings
in
such
emotional
turmoil
.
Does
sex
have
to
be
taken
so
seriously
?
"
And
now
he
found
himself
wondering
whether
she
knew
or
guessed
about
Amy
.
And
then
,
as
the
flaming
ball
rose
from
the
sea
,
the
gears
of
time
slipped
,
went
into
reverse
and
he
was
back
only
five
days
ago
lying
with
Amy
in
the
deep
hollow
of
the
dunes
,
smelling
again
the
scent
of
sand
and
grasses
and
the
salt
tang
of
the
sea
as
the
late
afternoon
warmth
drained
out
of
the
autumn
air
.
He
could
recall
every
sentence
,
every
gesture
,
the
timbre
of
her
voice
,
could
feel
again
the
hairs
rising
on
his
arms
at
her
touch
.
She
turned
towards
him
,
her
head
propped
on
her
hand
,
and
he
saw
the
strong
afternoon
light
shafting
with
gold
the
cropped
brightly
dyed
hair
.
Already
the
warmth
was
draining
from
the
air
and
he
knew
that
it
was
time
they
were
moving
.
But
lying
there
beside
her
,
listening
to
the
susurration
of
the
tide
and
looking
up
at
the
sky
through
a
haze
of
grasses
he
was
filled
,
not
with
post-coital
sadness
,
but
with
an
agreeable
languor
as
if
the
long-committed
Sunday
afternoon
still
stretched
ahead
of
them
.
It
was
Amy
who
said
:
"
Look
,
I
'd
better
be
getting
back
.
I
told
Neil
I
would
n't
be
more
than
an
hour
and
he
gets
fussy
if
I
'm
late
because
of
the
Whistler
.
"
"
The
Whistler
kills
at
night
not
in
daylight
.
And
he
'd
hardly
venture
on
the
heartland
.
Too
little
cover
.
But
Pascoe
's
right
to
be
concerned
.
There
is
n't
much
danger
,
but
you
should
n't
be
out
alone
at
night
.
No
woman
should
until
he
's
caught
.
"
She
said
:
"
I
wish
they
would
catch
him
.
It
'd
be
one
thing
less
for
Neil
to
worry
about
.
"
Making
Iris
voice
carefully
casual
,
he
asked
:
"
Does
n't
he
ever
ask
where
you
're
going
when
you
sneak
out
on
Sunday
afternoons
leaving
him
to
look
after
the
child
?
"
"
No
,
he
does
n't
.
And
the
child
is
called
Timmy
.
And
I
do
n't
sneak
.
I
say
I
'm
going
and
I
go
.
"
"
But
he
must
wonder
.
"
"
Oh
,
he
wonders
all
right
.
But
he
thinks
people
are
entitled
to
their
privacy
.
He
'd
like
to
ask
but
he
never
will
.
Sometimes
I
say
to
him
,
"
OK
,
I
'm
off
now
to
fuck
my
lover
in
the
sand
dunes
.
'
"
But
he
never
says
a
word
,
just
looks
miserable
because
he
does
n't
like
me
saying
"
'fuck'
"
.
'
"
Then
why
do
you
?
I
mean
,
why
torment
him
?
He
's
probably
fond
of
you
.
"
"
No
,
he
is
n't
,
not
very
fond
.
It
's
Timmy
he
likes
.
And
what
other
word
is
there
?
You
ca
n't
call
it
going
to
bed
.
I
've
only
been
in
your
bed
with
you
once
and
then
you
were
as
jumpy
as
a
cat
thinking
that
sister
of
yours
might
come
back
unexpectedly
.
And
you
ca
n't
say
we
sleep
together
.
"
He
said
:
"
We
make
love
.
Or
,
if
you
prefer
it
,
we
copulate
.
"
"
Honestly
,
Alex
,
that
's
disgusting
.
I
think
that
word
is
really
disgusting
.
"
"
And
do
you
do
it
with
him
?
Sleep
,
go
to
bed
,
make
love
,
copulate
?
"
"
No
,
I
do
n't
.
Not
that
it
"
s
any
business
of
yours
.
He
thinks
it
would
be
wrong
.
That
means
he
does
n't
really
want
to
.
If
men
want
to
they
usually
do
.
"
He
said
:
'That
has
been
my
experience
,
certainly
.
"
They
lay
side
by
side
like
effigies
,
both
staring
at
the
sky
.
She
seemed
content
not
to
talk
.
So
the
question
had
at
last
been
put
and
answered
.
It
had
been
with
shame
and
some
irritation
that
he
had
recognized
in
himself
for
the
first
time
the
nagging
of
jealousy
.
More
shaming
had
been
his
reluctance
to
put
it
to
the
test
.
And
there
were
those
other
questions
he
wanted
to
ask
but
dare
n't
.
"
What
do
I
mean
to
you
?
"
,
"
Is
this
important
?
"
,
"
What
do
you
expect
of
me
?
"
And
most
important
of
all
,
but
unanswerable
,
"
Do
you
love
me
?
"
With
his
wife
he
had
known
precisely
where
he
was
.
No
marriage
had
begun
with
a
more
definite
understanding
of
what
each
required
of
the
other
.
Their
unwritten
,
unspoken
,
only
half-acknowledged
pre-nuptial
agreement
had
needed
no
formal
ratification
.
He
would
earn
most
of
the
money
,
she
would
work
if
and
when
she
chose
.
She
had
never
been
particularly
enthusiastic
about
her
job
as
interior
designer
.
In
return
his
home
would
be
run
with
efficiency
and
reasonable
economy
.
They
would
take
separate
holidays
at
least
once
every
two
years
;
they
would
have
at
most
two
children
and
at
a
time
of
her
choosing
;
neither
would
publicly
humiliate
the
other
;
the
spectrum
of
marital
offences
under
this
heading
ranging
from
spoiling
the
other
's
dinner-party
stories
to
a
too-public
infidelity
.
It
had
been
a
success
.
They
had
liked
each
other
,
got
on
with
remarkably
little
rancour
and
he
had
been
genuinely
upset
,
if
principally
in
his
pride
,
when
she
had
left
him
.
Fortunately
marital
failure
had
been
mitigated
by
the
public
knowledge
of
her
lover
's
wealth
.
He
realized
that
to
a
materialistic
society
losing
a
wife
to
a
millionaire
hardly
counted
as
failure
.
In
their
friends
'
eyes
it
would
have
been
unreasonably
proprietorial
of
him
not
to
have
released
her
with
a
minimum
of
fuss
.
But
to
do
her
justice
,
Liz
had
loved
Gregory
,
would
have
followed
transformed
laughing
face
,
heard
her
ruefully
apologetic
voice
.
"
It
's
the
real
thing
this
time
,
darling
.
I
never
expected
it
and
I
can
still
hardly
believe
it
.
Try
not
to
feel
too
badly
,
it
is
n't
your
fault
.
There
's
nothing
to
be
done
.
"
The
real
thing
.
So
there
was
this
mysterious
real
thing
before
which
everything
went
down
,
obligations
,
habit
,
responsibility
,
duty
.
And
now
,
lying
in
the
dunes
,
seeing
the
sky
through
the
rigid
stalks
of
marram
grasses
,
he
thought
about
it
almost
with
terror
.
Surely
he
had
n't
found
it
at
last
and
with
a
girl
less
than
half
his
age
,
intelligent
but
uneducated
,
promiscuous
and
burdened
with
an
illegitimate
child
.
And
he
did
n't
deceive
himself
about
the
nature
of
her
hold
on
him
.
No
lovemaking
had
ever
been
as
erotic
or
as
liberating
as
their
half-illicit
couplings
on
unyielding
sand
within
yards
of
the
crashing
tide
.
Sometimes
he
would
find
himself
indulging
in
fantasy
,
would
picture
them
together
in
London
in
his
new
flat
.
The
flat
,
as
yet
unsought
,
no
more
than
a
vague
possibility
among
others
,
would
assume
dimensions
,
location
,
a
horribly
plausible
reality
in
which
he
found
himself
arranging
his
pictures
carefully
on
a
non-existent
wall
,
thinking
over
the
disposal
of
his
household
goods
,
the
exact
location
of
his
stereo
system
.
The
flat
overlooked
the
Thames
.
He
could
see
the
wide
windows
giving
a
view
over
the
river
as
far
as
Tower
Bridge
,
the
huge
bed
,
Amy
's
curved
body
striped
with
bands
of
sunlight
from
the
slatted
wooden
blinds
.
Then
the
sweet
,
deluding
pictures
would
dissolve
into
bleak
reality
.
There
was
the
child
.
She
would
want
the
child
with
her
.
Of
course
she
would
.
Anyway
,
who
else
could
look
after
it
?
He
could
see
the
indulgent
amusement
on
the
faces
of
his
friends
,
the
pleasure
of
his
enemies
,
the
child
lurching
,
sticky-fingered
,
about
the
flat
.
He
could
smell
in
imagination
what
Liz
had
never
let
him
know
in
actuality
-
the
smell
of
sour
milk
and
dirty
nappies
,
could
picture
the
dreadful
lack
of
peace
and
privacy
.
He
needed
these
realities
,
deliberately
emphasized
,
to
bring
him
back
to
sanity
.
He
was
horrified
that
even
for
a
few
minutes
he
could
seriously
have
contemplated
such
destructive
stupidity
.
He
thought
:
I
'm
obsessed
by
her
.
All
right
,
just
for
these
last
few
weeks
I
'll
enjoy
my
obsession
.
This
late
summer
would
be
brief
enough
,
the
warm
unseasonable
days
of
mellow
sunshine
could
n't
last
.
Already
the
evenings
were
darkening
.
Soon
he
would
smell
the
first
sour
tang
of
winter
on
the
sea
breezes
.
There
would
be
no
more
lying
in
the
warm
sand
dunes
.
She
could
n't
visit
Martyr
's
Cottage
again
,
that
would
be
recklessly
stupid
.
It
was
easy
to
convince
himself
that
with
care
,
when
Alice
was
in
London
and
no
visitors
expected
,
they
could
be
together
in
his
bedroom
perhaps
even
for
a
whole
night
,
but
he
knew
that
he
would
never
risk
it
.
Little
on
the
headland
was
private
for
long
.
This
was
his
St
Martin
's
summer
,
an
autumnal
madness
,
nothing
that
the
first
cold
of
winter
could
n't
wither
.
But
now
she
said
,
as
if
there
had
been
no
period
of
silence
between
them
,
"
Neil
's
my
friend
,
OK
?
Why
do
you
want
to
talk
about
him
"
I
do
n't
.
But
I
wish
he
'd
civilize
his
living
arrangements
.
That
caravan
is
in
direct
line
of
my
bedroom
windows
.
It
's
an
eyesore
.
"
"
You
'd
need
binoculars
to
see
it
from
your
windows
.
And
so
is
your
bloody
great
power
station
an
eyesore
.
That
's
in
everyone
's
direct
line
;
we
all
have
to
look
at
that
.
"
He
put
out
his
hand
to
her
shoulder
,
warm
under
the
gritty
film
of
sand
and
said
with
mock
pomposity
.
"
It
's
generally
agreed
that
,
given
the
constraints
imposed
by
its
function
and
the
site
,
the
power
station
is
rather
successful
architecturally
.
"
"
Agreed
by
whom
?
"
"
I
think
so
for
one
.
"
"
Well
,
you
would
,
would
n't
you
?
Anyway
,
you
ought
to
be
grateful
to
Neil
.
If
he
did
n't
look
after
Timmy
I
would
n't
be
here
.
"
He
said
:
"
That
whole
thing
is
primitive
.
He
's
got
a
wood
stove
in
there
,
has
n't
he
?
If
that
blows
up
you
wo
n't
last
a
minute
,
all
three
of
you
,
particularly
if
the
door
jams
.
"
"
We
do
n't
lock
it
.
Do
n't
be
daft
.
And
we
let
the
fire
go
out
at
night
.
And
suppose
your
place
blows
up
.
It
wo
n't
be
just
the
three
of
us
,
will
it
?
Bloody
hell
it
wo
n't
.
Not
only
humans
either
.
What
about
Smudge
and
Whisky
?
They
've
got
a
point
of
view
.
"
"
It
wo
n't
blow
up
.
You
've
been
listening
to
his
scaremongering
nonsense
.
If
you
're
worried
about
nuclear
power
ask
me
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
.
"
"
You
mean
while
you
're
poking
me
you
'll
explain
all
about
nuclear
power
?
Oh
boy
,
I
'll
certainly
be
able
to
take
it
in
.
"
And
then
she
turned
to
him
again
.
The
pattern
of
sand
on
her
shoulder
glistened
and
he
felt
her
mouth
moving
over
his
upper
lip
,
his
nipples
,
his
belly
.
And
then
she
knelt
over
him
and
the
round
childish
face
with
its
bush
of
bright
hair
shut
out
the
sky
.
Five
minutes
later
she
rolled
apart
from
him
and
began
shaking
the
sand
from
her
shirt
and
jeans
.
Tugging
the
jeans
over
her
thighs
,
she
said
:
"
Why
do
n't
you
do
something
about
that
bitch
at
Larksoken
,
the
one
suing
Neil
?
You
could
stop
her
.
You
're
the
boss
.
"
The
question
-
or
was
it
a
demand
-
shocked
him
out
of
his
fantasy
as
crudely
as
if
,
unprovoked
,
she
had
suddenly
slapped
his
face
.
In
their
four
meetings
she
had
never
questioned
him
about
his
job
,
had
seldom
mentioned
the
power
station
except
,
as
on
this
afternoon
,
to
complain
half
seriously
that
it
spoilt
the
view
.
He
had
n't
made
a
deliberate
decision
to
keep
her
out
of
his
private
and
professional
life
.
When
they
were
together
that
life
hardly
entered
into
his
own
consciousness
.
The
man
who
lay
with
Amy
in
the
dunes
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
burdened
,
ambitious
,
calculating
scientist
who
ran
Larksoken
,
nothing
to
do
with
Alice
's
brother
,
with
Elizabeth
's
ex-husband
,
with
Hilary
's
ex-lover
.
Now
he
wondered
,
with
a
mixture
of
irritation
and
dismay
,
whether
she
had
deliberately
chosen
to
ignore
those
invisible
keep-out
signs
.
And
if
he
had
been
unconfiding
,
then
so
had
she
.
He
knew
little
more
about
her
now
than
when
they
had
first
encountered
each
other
in
the
abbey
ruins
on
a
blustery
August
evening
less
than
six
weeks
earlier
,
had
for
a
minute
stood
and
gazed
and
had
then
moved
silently
towards
each
other
in
a
wordless
,
amazed
recognition
.
Later
that
evening
she
had
told
him
that
she
came
from
Newcastle
,
that
her
widowed
father
had
remarried
and
that
she
and
her
stepmother
could
n't
get
on
.
She
had
moved
down
to
London
and
lived
in
squats
.
It
had
sounded
commonplace
enough
but
he
had
n't
quite
believed
it
and
nor
,
he
suspected
,
did
she
care
whether
or
not
he
did
.
Her
accent
was
more
Cockney
than
Geordie
.
He
had
never
asked
about
the
child
,
partly
from
a
kind
of
delicacy
but
mainly
because
he
preferred
not
to
think
of
her
as
a
mother
,
and
she
had
volunteered
no
information
about
Timmy
or
his
father
.
She
said
:
"
Well
,
why
do
n't
you
?
Like
I
said
,
you
're
the
boss
.
"
"
Not
over
my
staff
's
private
lives
.
If
Hilary
Robarts
thinks
she
has
been
libelled
and
seeks
redress
I
ca
n't
prevent
her
from
going
to
law
.
"
"
You
could
if
you
wanted
to
.
And
Neil
only
wrote
what
was
true
.
"
"
That
is
a
dangerous
defence
to
a
libel
action
.
Pascoe
would
be
ill
advised
to
rely
on
it
.
"
"
She
wo
n't
get
any
money
.
He
has
n't
got
any
.
And
if
he
has
to
pay
costs
it
will
ruin
him
.
"
"
He
should
have
thought
of
that
earlier
.
"
She
lay
back
with
a
little
thud
and
for
a
few
minutes
they
were
both
silent
.
Then
she
said
as
casually
as
if
the
previous
conversation
had
been
trivial
small
talk
which
was
already
half
forgotten
:
"
What
about
next
Sunday
?
I
could
get
away
late
afternoon
.
OK
by
you
?
"
So
she
bore
no
grudge
.
It
was
n't
important
to
her
,
or
if
it
was
,
she
had
decided
to
drop
it
,
at
least
for
now
.
And
he
could
put
from
him
the
treacherous
suspicion
that
their
first
meeting
had
been
contrived
,
part
of
a
plan
devised
by
her
and
Pascoe
to
exploit
his
influence
with
Hilary
.
But
that
,
surely
,
was
ridiculous
.
He
had
only
to
recall
the
inevitability
of
their
first
coming
together
,
her
passionate
,
uncomplicated
,
animal
gusto
in
their
lovemaking
to
know
that
the
thought
was
paranoid
.
He
would
be
here
on
Sunday
afternoon
.
It
might
be
their
last
time
together
.
Already
he
had
half
decided
that
it
had
to
be
.
He
would
free
himself
from
this
enslavement
,
sweet
as
it
was
,
as
he
had
freed
himself
from
Hilary
.
And
he
knew
,
with
a
regret
which
was
almost
as
strong
as
grief
,
that
with
this
parting
there
would
be
no
protests
,
no
appeals
,
no
desperate
clinging
to
the
past
.
Amy
would
accept
his
leaving
as
calmly
as
she
had
accepted
his
arrival
.
He
said
:
"
OK
.
About
four
thirty
then
.
Sunday
the
twenty-fifth
.
"
And
now
time
,
which
in
the
last
ten
minutes
seemed
mysteriously
to
have
halted
,
flowed
again
and
he
was
standing
at
his
bedroom
window
five
days
later
watching
the
great
ball
of
the
sun
rise
out
of
the
sea
to
stain
the
horizon
and
spread
over
the
eastern
sky
the
veins
and
arteries
of
the
new
day
.
Sunday
the
twenty-fifth
.
He
had
made
that
appointment
five
days
ago
and
it
was
one
that
he
would
keep
.
But
lying
there
in
the
dunes
he
had
n't
known
what
he
knew
now
,
that
he
had
another
and
very
different
appointment
to
keep
on
Sunday
,
September
the
twenty-fifth
.
Shortly
after
lunch
Meg
walked
across
the
headland
to
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
The
Copleys
had
gone
upstairs
to
take
their
afternoon
rest
and
for
a
moment
she
wondered
whether
to
tell
them
to
lock
their
bedroom
door
.
But
she
told
herself
that
the
precaution
was
surely
unnecessary
and
ridiculous
.
She
would
bolt
the
back
door
and
lock
the
front
door
after
her
as
she
left
and
she
would
n't
be
gone
for
long
.
And
they
were
perfectly
happy
to
be
left
.
Sometimes
it
seemed
to
her
that
old
age
reduced
anxiety
.
They
could
look
at
the
power
station
without
the
slightest
premonition
of
disaster
and
the
horror
of
the
Whistler
seemed
as
much
beyond
their
interest
as
it
was
their
comprehension
.
The
greatest
excitement
in
their
lives
,
which
had
to
be
planned
with
meticulous
care
and
some
anxiety
,
was
a
drive
into
Norwich
or
Ipswich
to
shop
.
It
was
a
beautiful
afternoon
,
warmer
than
most
in
the
past
disappointing
summer
.
There
was
a
gentle
breeze
and
from
time
to
time
Meg
paused
and
lifted
her
head
to
feel
the
warmth
of
the
sun
and
the
sweet-smelling
air
moving
against
her
cheeks
.
The
turf
was
springy
beneath
her
feet
and
to
the
south
the
abbey
stones
,
no
longer
mysterious
or
sinister
,
gleamed
golden
against
the
blue
untroubled
sea
.
She
did
not
need
to
ring
.
The
door
at
Martyr
's
Cottage
stood
open
as
it
often
did
in
sunny
weather
,
and
she
called
out
to
Alice
before
,
in
response
to
her
answering
voice
,
moving
down
the
corridor
to
the
kitchen
.
The
cottage
was
redolent
with
the
zesty
smell
of
lemon
overlaying
the
more
familiar
tang
of
polish
,
wine
and
wood
smoke
.
It
was
a
smell
so
keen
that
it
momentarily
brought
back
the
holiday
she
and
Martin
had
spent
in
Amalfi
,
the
trudge
hand-in-hand
up
the
winding
road
to
the
mountain-top
,
the
pile
of
lemons
and
oranges
by
the
roadside
,
putting
their
noses
to
those
golden
,
pitted
skins
,
the
laughter
and
the
happiness
.
The
image
experienced
in
a
flash
of
gold
,
a
flush
of
warmth
to
her
face
,
was
so
vivid
that
for
a
second
she
hesitated
at
the
kitchen
door
as
if
disorientated
.
Then
her
vision
cleared
and
she
saw
the
familiar
objects
,
the
Aga
and
the
gas
stove
with
the
nearby
working
surfaces
,
the
table
of
polished
oak
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
its
four
elegantly
crafted
chairs
,
and
at
the
far
end
Alice
's
office
with
the
walls
covered
with
bookshelves
and
her
desk
piled
with
proofs
.
Alice
was
standing
working
at
the
table
,
wearing
her
long
fawn
smock
.
She
said
:
"
As
you
can
see
,
I
'm
making
lemon
curd
.
Alex
and
I
enjoy
it
occasionally
and
I
enjoy
making
it
,
which
I
suppose
is
sufficient
justification
for
the
trouble
.
"
"
We
hardly
ever
had
it
-
Martin
and
I
,
that
is
.
I
do
n't
think
I
've
eaten
it
since
childhood
.
Mother
bought
it
occasionally
as
a
treat
for
Sunday
tea
.
"
"
If
she
bought
it
,
then
you
do
n't
know
what
it
ought
to
taste
like
.
"
Meg
laughed
and
settled
into
the
wicker
chair
to
the
left
of
the
fireplace
.
She
never
asked
if
she
could
help
in
the
kitchen
since
she
knew
Alice
would
be
irritated
by
an
offer
which
she
knew
to
be
impractical
and
insincere
.
Help
was
neither
needed
nor
welcomed
.
But
Meg
loved
to
sit
quietly
and
watch
.
Was
it
perhaps
a
memory
of
childhood
,
she
wondered
,
that
made
watching
a
woman
cooking
in
her
own
kitchen
so
extraordinarily
reassuring
and
satisfying
.
If
so
,
modern
children
were
being
deprived
of
yet
one
more
source
of
comfort
in
their
increasingly
disordered
and
frightening
world
.
She
said
:
"
Mother
did
n't
make
lemon
curd
but
she
did
enjoy
cooking
.
It
was
all
very
simple
,
though
.
"
"
That
's
the
difficult
kind
.
And
I
suppose
you
helped
her
.
I
can
picture
you
in
your
pinafore
making
gingerbread
men
.
"
"
She
used
to
give
me
a
piece
of
the
dough
when
she
was
making
pastry
.
By
the
time
I
'd
finished
pounding
it
,
rolling
it
and
shaping
it
,
it
was
dun-coloured
.
And
I
used
to
cut
out
shaped
biscuits
.
And
yes
,
I
did
make
gingerbread
men
with
currants
for
their
eyes
,
did
n't
you
?
