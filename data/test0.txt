Detective
Chief
Inspector
John
McLeish
gazed
doubtfully
at
the
plate
before
him
.
Having
thought
he
was
hungry
,
he
now
realized
that
actually
he
needed
anything
rather
than
the
overflowing
plate
of
cholesterol
the
canteen
at
New
Scotland
Yard
had
provided
with
such
admirable
promptness
.
Sleep
would
perhaps
make
more
sense
after
thirty-six
hours
straight
on
duty
,
much
of
it
spent
with
a
sullen
Jamaican
who
had
killed
his
landlady
and
her
three
children
in
the
crowded
kitchen
of
a
house
behind
the
Westway
.
He
took
an
experimental
mouthful
of
fried
egg
and
waited
to
see
if
it
was
going
to
suit
him
,
then
progressed
to
the
baked
beans
,
cautiously
.
He
finished
the
egg
,
all
the
baked
beans
and
one
of
the
sausages
,
but
decided
the
fried
bread
was
tempting
fate
and
pushed
the
plate
aside
,
reaching
for
his
cup
of
tea
,
resting
both
elbows
on
the
table
.
He
lifted
a
hand
off
his
cup
in
weary
salute
to
one
of
his
sergeants.
a
very
dark
Scot
in
a
crumpled
grey
suit
who
was
walking
over
from
the
counter
,
and
the
man
altered
course
to
sit
opposite
him
.
"
How
goes
it
,
Bruce
?
"
Bruce
Davidson
had
accompanied
McLeish
from
his
last
posting
to
C1
,
that
division
of
New
Scotland
Yard
concerned
exclusively
with
murder
,
and
they
had
now
worked
together
for
four
years
in
the
CID
.
"
Got
that
Tottenham
case
weighed
off
,
nae
bother
.
I
hear
you
've
finished
the
Westway
job
.
Ye
need
to
get
your
head
down
,
John
,
you
're
looking
rough
.
"
McLeish
nodded
.
He
had
glanced
in
the
washroom
mirror
and
it
had
not
been
a
reassuring
sight
.
A
big
man
,
six
foot
four
inches
in
his
socks
and
a
good
fourteen
stone
,
he
always
looked
mildly
untidy
,
and
this
morning
,
having
worn
the
same
clothes
for
a
day
and
a
half
he
looked
like
a
football
supporter
after
a
night
in
the
cells
.
At
thirty-two
,
he
was
young
enough
not
to
look
completely
haggard
,
even
after
thirty-six
hours
with
only
the
odd
hour
's
sleep
,
but
his
dark
hair
was
plastered
to
his
head
and
the
brown
eyes
were
sunk
back
in
his
head
and
reddened
with
smoke
and
exhaustion
.
"
I
'm
going
off
.
You
too
?
"
"
I
'm
waiting
for
Catherine
-
Sergeant
Crane
.
"
Even
falling
asleep
as
he
was
,
McLeish
was
amused
at
Bruce
Davidson
's
hopeful
,
proprietorial
air
.
Catherine
Crane
had
joined
the
division
three
months
ago
,
creating
a
major
upheaval
.
She
was
a
slight
young
woman
of
twenty-seven
,
whose
dazzling
,
delicate
,
blond
looks
concealed
a
ferocious
intelligence
and
attack
.
Every
man
in
her
vicinity
had
found
himself
putting
his
best
foot
forward
,
and
she
had
done
wonders
for
the
sartorial
standards
of
the
notoriously
uncaring
C1
division
.
McLeish
himself
,
though
admiring
,
had
been
unaffected
;
he
had
been
in
love
for
over
a
year
with
a
young
woman
only
a
little
older
,
and
even
cleverer
,
than
Sergeant
Crane
.
His
Francesca
was
a
rising
star
in
the
Department
of
Trade
and
Industry
,
and
they
planned
to
celebrate
her
thirtieth
birthday
with
a
skiing
holiday
,
due
to
start
in
two
weeks
'
time
.
He
smiled
on
Davidson
,
cheered
immeasurably
by
the
thought
of
getting
on
a
plane
with
Francesca
.
After
chatting
to
Davidson
for
a
few
minutes
longer
,
he
went
back
to
his
office
.
looking
for
his
secretary
,
a
plumpish
,
infinitely
competent
,
middle-aged
mother
of
three
.
She
was
on
the
phone
and
he
stood
silently
,
filling
the
doorway
,
raising
an
eyebrow
at
her
.
She
motioned
him
to
stay
.
"
It
's
Francesca
,
John
.
"
"
Thanks
,
Jenny
.
I
'll
take
it
back
there
,
"
he
said
,
brightening
,
and
she
watched
,
with
a
little
jealousy
.
as
he
hurried
back
to
his
desk
.
"
Darling
.
I
've
got
a
horrendous
problem
.
Can
you
possibly
duck
out
and
have
coffee
in
the
caff
in
ten
minutes
?
"
The
voice
at
the
other
end
was
slightly
husky
but
very
clear
.
"
It
's
Tristram
.
He
's
been
arrested
in
New
York
.
Better
not
talk
on
the
phone
,
had
we
?
"
"
Oh
,
Christ
.
No
.
I
'll
meet
you
.
"
He
put
down
the
phone
,
rattled
.
With
his
much-loved
Francesca
came
her
four
younger
brothers
for
whom
,
as
the
eldest
child
of
a
widow
,
she
had
always
considered
herself
responsible
.
All
four
were
talented
musicians
and
difficult
people
,
in
varying
degrees
;
Tristram
.
one
of
the
twenty-four-year-old
twins
,
had
proved
the
most
difficult
,
perhaps
because
he
was
not
the
most
talented
.
McLeish
gritted
his
teeth
,
and
,
trying
not
to
consider
the
implications
of
what
he
had
been
told
.
made
one
quick
phone
call
,
then
took
the
lift
down
and
walked
across
the
road
from
New
Scotland
Yard
to
the
little
cafe
which
was
,
as
usual
,
full
of
workmen
engaged
in
rebuilding
the
offices
in
the
area
.
Stopping
to
buy
a
paper
,
he
caught
sight
of
Francesca
through
the
window
,
perched
on
one
of
the
bar
stools
,
totally
unconscious
of
the
table
full
of
men
next
to
her
all
eyeing
her
long
legs
.
He
stood
and
watched
her
,
putting
off
the
moment
when
.
as
he
half
knew
,
he
would
be
asked
to
acquiesce
in
some
lunatic
scheme
for
pulling
Tristram
out
of
trouble
,
and
saw
her
for
a
moment
from
a
position
of
detachment
:
a
tall
young
woman
looking
younger
than
her
twenty-nine
years
.
